Heavy rainfall stimulates more N2O emissions from wheat fields during basal and overwintering fertilization phases. Extreme precipitation events have become increasingly prevalent globally. Runoff and leaching losses of nitrogen (N) are commonly observed after heavy rainfall, while post-rainfall N losses, particularly nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, are often overlooked. In this study, a field-simulated rainfall experiment was conducted under two conditions: with (CF) and without (CK) N fertilizer application, to examine the impact of precipitation on post-rainfall N2O emissions over a continuous 10-day period. Heavy rainfall (90 mm) was simulated on the 7th day after fertilization at basal (BFS), overwintering (WFS), and jointing (JFS) stages, based on CF treatment fertilization timing. Results showed a significant increase in soil nitrate N content after fertilization (F), leading to elevated N loss through runoff and leaching due to precipitation (P). Both P and F had significant effects on post-rainfall N2O emissions, though their interaction was not statistically significant. Average N2O emission intensity (NEI) in the CF treatment increased by 72.73 % relative to CK control, attributed to fertilization. Additionally, rainfall substantially intensified NEI during BFS and WFS stages (P<0.05 or 0.001), while it tended to decrease NEI during the JFS stage. Consequently, average NEI under rainfall conditions doubled compared to no-rainfall controls. Correlation analysis indicated that N2O emissions were primarily influenced by soil nitrate N content, nirS gene abundance, and denitrification potential in middle-lower layers (5-15 cm). Overall, the stimulating effect of heavy rainfall in the early growing period on post-rainfall N2O emissions in fertilized wheat fields warrants attention.

Nitrous oxide emissions from rivers in agricultural area under different rainfall scenarios: the effect of typhoons in intensifying the release. In agricultural regions, the chronic enrichment of nitrogen coupled with episodic hydrological disturbances can synergistically amplify riverine Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes through synchronized biogeochemical perturbations. This dual forcing mechanism underscores the critical role of agricultural watersheds as major contributors to terrestrial N2O budgets. Notably, rainfall events have important impacts on river nitrogen cycle and hydrological processes, indirectly perturb river N2O emission. However, the impacts of rainfall-particularly under extreme weather conditions-on riverine N2O dynamics remain poorly understood due to limited empirical data. In this study, we collected data of river environmental factors and associated N2O concentration and flux in the western part of Guangdong Province, China from 2021 to 2023 under various precipitation scenarios, including non--precipitation (NP), small precipitation (SP), initial rainfall-runoff (IRR), moderate precipitation (MP), heavy precipitation (HP), typhoon (DT), and post-typhoon (PT). Results revealed that N2O concentration and flux during DT were 12 and 617 times higher than those of NP in Luojiang River. Although typhoon events only accounted for only 1.3 %, 2 %, and 2 % of the total days in 2021, 2022, and 2023, they contributed 21 %, 12 %, and 34 % of the CO2-equivalent fluxes in these years. N2O concentration and flux also increased with rainfall, which was, however, not statistically significant. According to variable importance measurements from random forests (RFs) and redundancy analysis (RDA), hydrometeorological factors emerged as the dominant factor influencing N2O flux (73 %), followed by NO3- concentration (23 %)-the key substrate for denitrification-highlighting its critical role in determining N2O concentration. Our findings address the knowledge gap of river N2O emissions in agricultural areas during typhoons, providing essential data to support more accurate estimates of waterborne N2O emissions.

Moderate precipitation reduction enhances nitrogen cycling and soil nitrous oxide emissions in a semi-arid grassland. The ongoing climate change is predicted to induce more weather extremes such as frequent drought and high-intensity precipitation events, causing more severe drying-rewetting cycles in soil. However, it remains largely unknown how these changes will affect soil nitrogen (N)-cycling microbes and the emissions of potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Utilizing a field precipitation manipulation in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau, we examined how precipitation reduction (ca. -30%) influenced soil N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in field, and in a complementary lab-incubation with simulated drying-rewetting cycles. Results obtained showed that precipitation reduction stimulated plant root turnover and N-cycling processes, enhancing soil N2O and CO2 emissions in field, particularly after each rainfall event. Also, high-resolution isotopic analyses revealed that field soil N2O emissions primarily originated from nitrification process. The incubation experiment further showed that in field soils under precipitation reduction, drying-rewetting stimulated N mineralization and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in favor of genera Nitrosospira and Nitrosovibrio, increasing nitrification and N2O emissions. These findings suggest that moderate precipitation reduction, accompanied with changes in drying-rewetting cycles under future precipitation scenarios, may enhance N cycling processes and soil N2O emissions in semi-arid ecosystems, feeding positively back to the ongoing climate change.

Are annual nitrous oxide fluxes sensitive to warming and increasing precipitation in the Gurbantunggut Desert?. Temperate desert soils are an important source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). However, it is uncertain how N2O emissions respond to warming, increased rainfall and nitrogen (N) addition in such soils. A multifactorial field manipulation study was carried out in the Gurbantunggut Desert, China's second largest desert, to investigate how these factors influence desert soil N2O emissions and to assess inter-year variation. In our 3-year study, under current climatic conditions, the annual flux of N2O in this temperate desert soil was 0.13 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), with the period of no plant growth contributing 43% of the annual emission. Surprisingly, there was no significant change in annual N2O flux under warming (+1 degrees C) or increased precipitation (30%, +60 mm yr(-1)). In contrast, N2O emissions were significantly affected by extreme drought followed by precipitation. Additional N input, at 30 or 60 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), greatly elevated annual N2O emission by 55-133%. The combined impact of N deposition and increasing rainfall on N2O emission was greater than that of any single factor, except for N deposition. This suggests that N2O emissions in this desert are driven primarily by soil available N content and are less sensitive to variations in soil temperature and moisture.

Response patterns of simulated corn yield and soil nitrous oxide emission to precipitation change. BackgroundPrecipitation plays an important role in crop production and soil greenhouse gas emissions. However, how crop yield and soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission respond to precipitation change, particularly with different background precipitations (dry, normal, and wet years), has not been well investigated. In this study, we examined the impacts of precipitation changes on corn yield and soil N2O emission using a long-term (1981-2020, 40 years) climate dataset as well as seven manipulated precipitation treatments with different background precipitations using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model.ResultsResults showed large variations of corn yield and precipitation but small variation of soil N2O emission among 40 years. Both corn yield and soil N2O emission showed near linear relationships with precipitation based on the long-term precipitation data, but with different response patters of corn yield and soil N2O emission to precipitation manipulations. Corn yield showed a positive linear response to precipitation manipulations in the dry year, but no response to increases in precipitation in the normal year, and a trend of decrease in the wet year. The extreme drought treatments reduced corn yield sharply in both normal and wet years. In contrast, soil N2O emission mostly responded linearly to precipitation manipulations. Decreases in precipitation in the dry year reduced more soil N2O emission than those in the normal and wet years, while increases in precipitation increased more soil N2O emission in the normal and wet years than in the dry year.ConclusionsThis study revealed different response patterns of corn yield and soil N2O emission to precipitation and highlights that mitigation strategy for soil N2O emission reduction should consider different background climate conditions.

Effects of extra-extreme precipitation variability on multi-year cumulative nitrous oxide emission in a semiarid grassland. High temporal precipitation variability, characterized by less frequent but larger-magnitude precipitation events, is increasing. However, how precipitation variability affects N2O emissions and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, especially at multiple-year scales. We conducted a 3-year manipulative experiment in which the same long-term mean growing season precipitation total was repackaged into events of inversely varying magnitude and frequency to simulate four levels of precipitation variability (extra-extreme, extreme, medium, and normal) in a semiarid grassland. Cumulative N2O emissions was the smallest under the extra-extreme pre-cipitation variability scenario (6 very large rainfall events), 26% less than emission under the other three treatments (10, 16, and 24 rainfall events) over the three growing seasons. However, this difference was almost entirely due to three sampling events in the third year. Plant community (biomass and biodiversity), soil abiotic properties (water, dissolved organic carbon and pH), soil microbial biomass (carbon, nitrogen and the ratio), and soil functional genes (archaeal and bacterial amoA, nirS, nirK, narG, and nosZ) explained 61% of the variation in N2O emissions in response to the precipitation variability. Structural equation modelling indicated that the precipitation variability had direct positive effects, and indirect negative effects via soil abiotic properties, on soil functional genes that ultimately had positive effects on N2O emissions. The reduction in N2O emission in the extra-extreme precipitation variability scenario in the third year was due to low levels of soil water content, soil pH, aboveground biomass, and microbial biomass carbon simultaneously. Our results suggest that at the multi -year timescale, semiarid grasslands may have negative feedbacks to future precipitation regimes with higher variability.

Unimodal response of N2O flux to changing rainfall amount and frequency in a wet meadow in the Tibetan Plateau. The rainfall amount and the frequency of extreme rainfall events have been predicted to increase in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during the growing season. These changes will likely affect ecosystem processes, including those that control nitrogen (N) cycling and storage; however, the direction of the changes remains unclear. In this study, we experimentally altered the amount and frequency of precipitation events during the growing season (May through October) at an alpine wetland in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The treatments included ambient rain (CK) plus 25 mm of extra water for each irrigation event but with different irrigation frequency, i.e., weekly (DF1), biweekly (DF2), every three weeks (DF3) and every four weeks (DF4). During the growing season, the N2O flux showed a large seasonal variation. Compared with the treatment of natural rainfall events, the increase in the rainfall amount promoted the N2O emission flux. As the frequency of rainfall events increased, the above-ground biomass increased significantly from 85.82 g.m(-2) to 245.79 g.m(-2), and the accumulated N2O emissions first increased and then decreased; we observed the peak of the N2O flux at the DF2 rainfall frequency. We also found the significant linear relationships between soil N2O flux, nitrate nitrogen, and microbial biomass nitrogen content. Furthermore, among the soil microbial factors, higher rainfall frequency (DF1) significantly reduced the relative abundance of the original dominant species (Alphcproteobacteria) in the studied wetland soil. Our results indicate that alpine wetlands are highly sensitive to increased precipitation variability and high frequencies of extreme rainfall events could significantly reduce N2O emission. Future precipitation patterns could weaken the contribution rate of wetland N2O emission to the global warming.

Bacterial denitrification drives elevated N2O emissions in arid southern California drylands. Soils are the largest source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), a powerful greenhouse gas. Dry soils rarely harbor anoxic conditions to favor denitrification, the predominant N2O-producing process, yet, among the largest N2O emissions have been measured after wetting summer-dry desert soils, raising the question: Can denitrifiers endure extreme drought and produce N2O immediately after rainfall? Using isotopic and molecular approaches in a California desert, we found that denitrifiers produced N2O within 15 minutes of wetting dry soils (site preference = 12.8 +/- 3.92 per mil, delta N-15(bulk) = 18.6 +/- 11.1 per mil). Consistent with this finding, we detected nitrate-reducing transcripts in dry soils and found that inhibiting microbial activity decreased N2O emissions by 59%. Our results suggest that despite extreme environmental conditions-months without precipitation, soil temperatures of >= 40 degrees C, and gravimetric soil water content of <1%-bacterial denitrifiers can account for most of the N2O emitted when dry soils are wetted.

Implications of climate change for grassland in Europe: impacts, adaptations and mitigation options: a review. Climate change associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may have important implications for Europe's grasslands. Projected scenarios indicate that increased temperatures and CO2 concentrations have the potential to increase herbage growth and to favour legumes more than grasses, but changes in seasonal precipitation would reduce these benefits particularly in areas with low summer rainfall. Further implications for grasslands may arise from increased frequency of droughts, storms and other extreme events. Potential farm-scale adaptive responses to climate change are identified. Grassland agriculture also contributes to GHG emissions, particularly methane and nitrous oxide, and management of grassland affects net carbon balances and carbon sequestration. Management options are identified for mitigating grassland's contribution to GHG emissions which need to be developed in a holistic way that also considers other pressures.

Contrasting effects of water deficits and rewetting on greenhouse gas emissions in two grassland and forest ecosystems. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of water deficits and extreme rainfall events in temperate regions, with significant effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, we investigated the impact of water deficits and drying and rewetting events on GHG fluxes in two Irish sites with adjacent forest and grassland ecosystems. We deployed rain-out shelters to simulate drought and applied water to mimic the extreme precipitation events. The effects of warming on these events were also examined using soil cores collected from the field. Water deficits increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at the evergreen coniferous forest site but decreased it at the broadleaf deciduous forest site, likely due to differences in the prevailing soil moisture contents and the availability of oxygen for microbial activity. Rewetting triggered pulses of CO2 (1.1 - 7.2 fold), methane (CH4) (> 20 fold), and nitrous oxide (N2O) (3.3 - 71.7 fold) emissions in both ecosystems. Warming amplified the effects of water additions, leading to a 1.9 - 3.4-fold increase in CO2 and N2O fluxes, compared to the pre-wetting levels and a 1.2 - 1.5-fold increase compared to the controls. Cumulative CO2 emissions over 24 hours showed a negative response to increasing soil moisture and a positive response to the changes in soil moisture (difference between the initial value before water addition and the final soil moisture after water addition). CH4 fluxes exhibited an opposite trend. Multiple linear regression revealed that at higher soil carbon concentrations CO2 emissions were reduced but CH4 emissions increased, for the same change in soil moisture. Given that future climate scenarios predict an increase in extreme rainfall events a better understanding of the influence of soil drying-rewetting events on GHG emissions is required that accounts for multiple influencing factors, including differences in regional and site characteristics.

Soil oxygen depletion and corresponding nitrous oxide production at hot moments in an agricultural soil. Hot moments of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions induced by interactions between weather and management make a major contribution to annual N2O budgets in agricultural soils. The causes of N2O production during hot moments are not well understood under field conditions, but emerging evidence suggests that short-term fluctuations in soil oxygen (O-2) concentration can be critically important. We conducted high time-resolution field observations of O-2 and N2O concentrations during hot moments in a dryland agricultural soil in Northern China. Three typical management and weather events, including irrigation (Irr.), fertilization coupled with irrigation (Fer.+Irr.) or with extreme precipitation (Fer.+Pre.), were observed. Soil O-2 and N2O concentrations were measured hourly for 24 h immediately following events and measured daily for at least one week before and after the events. Soil moisture, temperature, and mineral N were simultaneously measured. Soil O-2 concentrations decreased rapidly within 4 h following irrigation in both the Irr. and Fer.+Irr. events. In the Fer.+Pre. event, soil O-2 depletion did not occur immediately following fertilization but began following subsequent continuous rainfall. The soil O-2 concentration dropped to as low as 0.2% (with the highest soil N2O concentration of up to 180 ppmv) following the Fer.+Pre. event, but only fell to 11.7% and 13.6% after the Fer.+Irr. and Irr. events, which were associated with soil N2O concentrations of 27 ppmv and 3 ppmv, respectively. During the hot moments of all three events, soil N2O concentrations were negatively correlated with soil O-2 concentrations (r = -0.5, P < 0.01), showing a quadratic increase as soil O-2 concentrations declined. Our results provide new understanding of the rapid short response of N2O production to O-2 dynamics driven by changes in soil environmental factors during hot moments. Such understanding helps improve soil management to avoid transitory O-2 depletion and reduce the risk of N2O production.

Assessing climate change impacts on sugarcane yield, crop water productivity, and nitrous oxide emissions across Brazil's bioenergy using the CSM-SAMUCA-sugarcane model. Context: Sugarcane-based bioenergy systems are critical in Brazil's renewable energy sector, contributing significantly to global efforts to reduce fossil fuel dependence. However, climate change introduces uncertainties related to sugarcane yield, water use efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions. Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, increasing temperatures, and shifts in precipitation patterns are expected to impact Brazil's bioenergy cultivated areas, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of their effects on sugarcane production and environmental sustainability. Objective: This study assessed the effects of rising CO2, temperature increases, and altered precipitation on sugarcane yield, crop water productivity (WP), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions across Brazil's bioenergy cultivation areas under future climate scenarios. Methods: We integrated the CSM-SAMUCA-Sugarcane model with the DSSAT-GHG module to simulate sugarcane systems across nine agroclimatic zones. Future projections (2040-2070) were based on 20 CMIP6 Global Climate Models (GCMs) under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5). Results and conclusions: SSP1-2.6 (low-emission scenario) showed minor yield changes, with some CO2 fertilization gains. SSP3-7.0 (intermediate/high-emission scenario) may increase yield by up to 10 % due to warming and CO2 effects. However, SSP5-8.5 (most extreme warming) and rainfall reductions increased yield variability. N2O emissions may rise by 5-30 %, with intensities up to 40 % higher, driven by warmer soils and faster residue decomposition. WP responses varied: some regions gained from CO2-induced efficiency, others declined due to soil moisture limits. Significance: Balancing yield improvements with N2O mitigation under climate change remains a challenge. Climate-resilient nitrogen and residue management strategies are essential to ensure sustainable bioenergy production in Brazil.

Emission of greenhouse gas from urban polluted river during different rainfall events: Typhoon and storm will promote stronger evasions. Urban rivers have been recognized as significant hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the impact of storms or typhoons on GHG emissions from urban rivers is not well understood. Suzhou Creek located in the highly developed urban area of Shanghai was selected to investigate of changes in CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations and diffusive fluxes during different rainfall events from May to October 2021. The findings showed that urban rivers were sources of GHG emissions during various events. The average diffusive fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O during typhoon events were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those during non-typhoon period, revealing that typhoon greatly promote GHG evasion. GHG CO2-equivalents were ranked as follows: during typhoon (3.93 g m(-2)h(-1)) > post-typhoon (0.89 g m(-2)h(- 1)) > high precipitation (0.33 g m(-2)h(- 1)) > non-precipitation (0.29 g m(-2)h(- 1)) > small precipitation (0.25 g m(-2)h(- 1)). Rainfall dilution, pump station drainage, sediment disturbance, and a high gas transfer coefficient induced by typhoons were the main factors affecting GHG emissions. Nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen in river water were important control parameters for GHG production. Overall, typhoon would release large amounts of GHG from urban rivers. Given the projected increase in the frequency and complexity of extreme weather events, this study highlights the importance of better understanding the dynamic response of urban river GHG to rainfall and typhoons.

Capturing temporal heterogeneity in soil nitrous oxide fluxes with a robust and low-cost automated chamber apparatus. Soils play an important role in Earth's climate system through their regulation of trace greenhouse gases. Despite decades of soil gas flux measurements using manual chamber methods, limited temporal coverage has led to high uncertainty in flux magnitude and variability, particularly during peak emission events. Automated chamber measurement systems can collect high-frequency (subdaily) measurements across various spatial scales but may be prohibitively expensive or incompatible with field conditions. Here we describe the construction and operational details for a robust, relatively inexpensive, and adaptable automated dynamic (steady-state) chamber measurement system modified from previously published methods, using relatively low cost analyzers to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The system was robust to intermittent flooding of chambers, long tubing runs (> 100 m), and operational temperature extremes (-12 to 39 degrees C) and was entirely powered by solar energy. Using data collected between 2017 and 2019 we tested the underlying principles of chamber operation and examined N2O did variation and rain-pulse timing that would be difficult to characterize using infrequent manual measurements. Stable steady-state flux dynamics were achieved during 29 min chamber closure periods at a relatively low flow rate (2 L min(-1)). Instrument performance and calculated fluxes were minimally impacted by variation in air temperature and water vapor. Measurements between 08:00 and 12:00 LT were closest to the daily mean N2O and CO2 emission. Afternoon fluxes (12:00-16:00 LT) were 28 % higher than the daily mean for N2O (4.04 vs. 3.15 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) and were 22 % higher for CO2 (4.38 vs. 3.60 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). High rates of N2O emission are frequently observed after precipitation. Following four discrete rainfall events, we found a 12-26 h delay before peak N2O flux, which would be difficult to capture with manual measurements. Our observation of substantial and variable diel trends and rapid but variable onset of high N2O emissions following rainfall supports the need for high-frequency measurements.

Long-term grazing effects on soil-atmosphere exchanges of CO2, CH4 and N2O at different grasslands in Inner Mongolia: A soil core study. Regional greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets in vast grasslands may be changing due to overgrazing and grassland types. However, the comprehensive effects of grazing patterns, environmental factors and grassland types on soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) exchanges have been poorly studied. This study investigates the effects of long-term grazing on the soil-atmosphere exchanges of CO2, CH4 and N2O in important processes within different grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China. Using manual static chamber and gas chromatography, we measured the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O from intact soil cores of paired grazed/ungrazed sites collected from two typical steppes (Stipa grandis and Leymus chinensis): one wetland in a flood plain and one desert steppe in the region of the Xilin River catchment, Inner Mongolia. Soil gas flux and concentration measurements were conducted in four simulated conditions (Le., drought, dry-wet, intense rainfall and freeze-thaw), which represent important processes in annual GHG exchanges. Extreme drought significantly inhibited CO2 and N2O emissions in all plots but did not change the CH4 uptake by typical steppes. Dry-wet transition and intense rainfall could remarkably promote soil CO2 emission pulses at different types, significantly decrease CH4 uptake by typical steppes, and arouse N2O emission pulses at all plots with different times of occurrence. During the freeze-thaw simulation, temperature-induced soil CO2 emission and CH4 uptake/emission presented a clear alternative variation, while soil thaw only slightly increased ( < 15 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) in the steppes and sand dunes and was significantly higher in the wetland (11-96 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). Long-term grazing significantly inhibited soil respiration rates at all grassland types, significantly decreased CH4 uptake by the Leymus chinensis steppes, and did not show significant influence on N2O emission due to large spatial variations for all types. Compared to the ungrazed Leymus steppes, Stipa steppes, sand dune and wetland, continuously grazed sites were significantly reduced by 22%, 38%, 48% and 47% in total GHG emissions, respectively. Our results indicate that the potential of the steppe soil CH4 sink function can be offset by N2O emission, especially in over-grazed plots. Furthermore, N2O emissions should be considered in wetland rangelands with significantly higher N2O emission potential (range: 0-343 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) more than steppes (range: 0-132 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and sand dunes (range: 0-49 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). Nevertheless, comprehensive evaluation of the grazing effect on ecosystem GHG emissions merits consider in both field observation and incubation experiments because soil properties and environmental factors could be changed by vegetation growth in different grazing practices.

Alternatives for methane emission mitigation in livestock systems. Human activities are contributing to Global Climate Change through the production of Green House Gases (GHG), which result in increased air, land and ocean temperatures and extreme changes in precipitation in regions of low and high rainfall. The most important GHG's are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). It is estimated that 18 % of the annual GHG emissions come from different types of livestock and that 37% of CH4, with higher global warming potential (23) relative to CO2 (1), comes from fermentation processes in ruminants. It is possible that in the future beef and milk exports from producing countries is subject to bans if cattle systems do not comply with measures to reduce GHG. There are several alternatives available and being researched to reduce enteric CH4 emissions from cattle that range from manipulating diet composition, supplementing feed additives (i.e. ionophores, organic acids, halogenated compounds, oils) and selection of forage plants of high quality and containing secondary metabolites (i.e. tannins and saponins) to animal breeding, immunization and genetic transformation of rumen microorganisms. Results show that inhibition of enteric CH4 emission is possible through the use of ionophores, organic acids and oils. The use of ionophores can result in resistance of rumen microbes and as a result the effect is short term. The high cost of organic acids makes it unlikely that there direct supplementation in ruminant diets is economically viable. However, organic acids are present at relatively high concentrations in the leaf tissue of plants and attempts should be made to select and breed forages with higher levels of these compounds. It is argued that a more efficient strategy to reduce enteric CH4 in ruminants is through selection of grasses of high quality (i. e. high concentration of water soluble carbohydrates), of forage legumes containing secondary metabolites like tannins and of fruits/plants containing saponins, provided that they do not affect intake and digestibility. Improved nutrition of cattle through feeding high quality forages can result in high animal performance and in reductions of CH4 emitted per unit of dry matter intake and per unit of product.

Nitrous oxide emissions from a rainfed-cultivated black soil in Northeast China: effect of fertilization and maize crop. Nitrous oxide emission (N2O) from applied fertilizer across the different agricultural landscapes especially those of rainfed area is extremely variable (both spatially and temporally), thus posing the greatest challenge to researchers, modelers, and policy makers to accurately predict N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions from a rainfed, maize-planted, black soil (Udic Mollisols) were monitored in the Harbin State Key Agroecological Experimental Station (Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China). The four treatments were: a bare soil amended with no N (C0) or with 225 kg N ha(-1) (CN), and maize (Zea mays L.)-planted soils fertilized with no N (P0) or with 225 kg N ha(-1) (PN). Nitrous oxide emissions significantly (P < 0.05) increased from 141 +/- 5 g N2O-N ha(-1) (C0) to 570 +/- 33 g N2O-N ha(-1) (CN) in unplanted soil, and from 209 +/- 29 g N2O-N ha(-1) (P0) to 884 +/- 45 g N2O-N ha(-1) (PN) in planted soil. Approximately 75 % of N2O emissions were from fertilizer N applied and the emission factor (EF) of applied fertilizer N as N2O in unplanted and planted soils was 0.19 and 0.30 %, respectively. The presence of maize crop significantly (P < 0.05) increased the N2O emission by 55 % in the N-fertilized soil but not in the N-unfertilized soil. There was a significant (P < 0.05) interaction effect of fertilization x maize on N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide fluxes were significantly affected by soil moisture and soil temperature (P < 0.05), with the temperature sensitivity of 1.73-2.24, which together explained 62-76 % of seasonal variation in N2O fluxes. Our results demonstrated that N2O emissions from rainfed arable black soils in Northeast China primarily depended on the application of fertilizer N; however, the EF of fertilizer N as N2O was low, probably due to low precipitation and soil moisture.

Nitrous oxide emissions from irrigated and fertilized spring maize in semi-arid northern China. As maize requires a high input of fertilizer nitrogen, it is likely to be an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O). Detailed information on N2O emissions over long time periods, and management practices that aim to reduce N2O emissions from spring maize fields in China is lacking. Consequently we measured the emissions of N2O from a spring maize field continuously from 2007 to 2009 at Yuci, Shanxi Province, China using newly developed automated chambers and explored strategies to reduce N2O emissions. The results showed that the Optimal fertilizer treatment (120 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) produced the same yield of grain as the Traditional fertilizer treatment (330 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), and significantly reduced N2O emissions by 48%. Topdressing with urea was the main source of N2O, which on average accounted for 58% of the total N2O emissions each year. Uptake of N2O occurred during the late stage of maize growth when soil mineral N content was less than 46.4 mg N kg(-1) soil. The N2O emission factors were lower than the IPCC default value. Nitrous oxide emissions could also be reduced if farmers did not apply fertilizer N during periods of heavy rainfall and did not irrigate immediately after fertilization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Impact of maize growth on N2O emission from farmland soil. Crop growth is a key factor that effects nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in farmland soil. Clarification and quantification of the impact of maize growth on N2O emission are important to guide maize planting and patterns, which is also useful for building model to simulate N2O emission in an agroecosystem. In this study, we carried out a three-year (2013-2015) field experiment to evaluate the contribution of maize growth on N2O emission using a split-plot design. The factors included planting versus not planting maize, and four rates of nitrogen (N) application (0, 150, 300, 450 kg N/ha). Our results showed the impacts of maize growth on N2O emission decreased linearly with the growth of maize from the 43rd day after sowing (y = -1.07x + 26.85, R-2 = 0.95). Nitrogen fertilizer application can reduce the impacts of maize growth on N2O emission. The impact of maize growth on soil NH4+- N and NO3-- N are similar to N2O emission, and they have a strong correlation. We concluded that maize growth reduces soil N2O emission but N application can exert an antagonistic effect, and the impact of maize growth on soil NH4+-N and NO3-- N largely determines the impacts of maize growth on N2O emission.

Nitrous oxide emissions from an irrigated sandy-clay loam cropped to maize and wheat. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were measured from an irrigated sandy-clay loam cropped to maize and wheat, each receiving urea at 100 kg N ha(-1) During the maize season (24 August-26 October), N2O emissions ranged between -0.94 and 1.53 g N ha(-1) h(-1) with peaks during different irrigation cycles (four) ranging between 0.08 and 1.53 g N ha(-1) h(-1). N2O sink activity during the maize season was recorded on 10 of the 29 sampling occasions and ranged between 0.18 and 0.94 g N ha(-1) h(-1). N2O emissions during the wheat season (22 November-20 April) Varied between -0.85 and 3.27 g N ha(-1) h(-1), whereas peaks during different irrigation cycles (six) were in the range of 0.05 - 3.27 g N ha(-1) h(-1). N2O sink activity was recorded on 14 of the 41 samplings during the wheat season and ranged between 0.01 and 0.87 g N ha(-1) h(-1). Total N2O emissions were 0.16 and 0.49 kg N ha(-1), whereas the total N2O sink activity was 0.04 and 0.06 kg N ha(-1) during the maize and wheat seasons, respectively. N2O emissions under maize were significantly correlated with denitrification rate and soil NO3--N but not with soil NH4+- or soil temperature. Under wheat, however, N2O emissions showed a strong correlation with soil NH4+-N, soil NO3--N and soil temperature but not with the denitrification rate. Under either crop, N2O emissions did not shaw a significant relationship with water-filled pore space or soil respiration. C1 Nucl Inst Agr & Biol, Soil Biol Div, Faisalabad, Pakistan.

Does incorporation of cowpea-maize residue mixes influence nitrous oxide emission and mineral nitrogen release in a tropical luvisol?. In the face of climate change, quantification of the emission of nitrous oxide from soils in relation to sufficient N availability for crop uptake has assumed much significance. This study used the N-15 stable isotope technique, under controlled laboratory conditions, to quantify the interactive effect on and relative contributions of the component species to N2O emission and mineral N dynamics in a tropical luvisol incorporated with different rates of cowpea-maize residue mixtures. The results show that increasing the maize residue proportion in the mixture significantly decreases N2O emission compared to the sole cowpea incorporation but increases mineral N concentration compared to sole maize residue incorporation. It is concluded that mixing low C:N ratio cowpea residue with high C:N ratio maize residue has potential for N management in tropical legume-cereal intercropping systems with the view to minimizing N2O emission while making N available for crop uptake.

Effects of Irrigation on N2O Emissions in a Maize Crop Grown on Different Soil Types in Two Contrasting Seasons. Crop management and soil properties affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cropping systems. Irrigation is one of the agronomical management practices that deeply affects soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Careful management of irrigation, also concerning to soil type, might mitigate the emissions of this powerful GHG from agricultural soils. In the Mediterranean area, despite the relevance of the agricultural sector to the overall economy and sustainable development, the topic of N2O emissions does not have the same importance as N2O fluxes in temperate agricultural areas. Only some research has discussed N2O emissions from Mediterranean cropping systems. Therefore, in this study, N2O emissions from different soil types (sandy-loam and clay soils) were analyzed in relation to the irrigation of a maize crop grown in two contrasting seasons (2009-2010). The irrigation was done using a center pivot irrigation system about twice a week. The N2O emissions were monitored throughout the two-years of maize crop growth. The emissions were measured with the accumulation technique using eight static chambers (four chambers per site). Nitrogen fertilizer was applied in the form of ammonium sulphate and urea with 3,4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) nitrification inhibitors. In 2009, the N2O emissions and crop biomass measured in both soil types were lower than those measured in 2010. This situation was a lower amount of water and nitrogen (N) available to the crop. In 2010, the N2O fluxes were higher in the clay site than those in the sandy-loam site after the first fertilization, whereas an opposite trend was found after the second fertilization. The soil temperature, N content, and soil humidity were the main drivers for N2O emission during 2009, whereas during 2010, only the N content and soil humidity affected the nitrous oxide emissions. The research has demonstrated that crop water management deeply affects soil N2O emissions, acting differently for denitrification and nitrification. The soil properties affect N2O emission by influencing the microclimate conditions in the root zone, conditioning the N2O production.

Single-event nitrous oxide losses under maize production as affected by soil type, tillage, rotation, and fertilization. Soil nitrate (NO3) can be especially susceptible to leaching and denitrification in late spring under maize (Zea mays L.) production. This study examined the effects of tillage (untilled; tilled), fertilizer application (full season rate or starter-only at planting), rotation (maize after orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L); continuous maize), and soil type (clay loam; loamy fine sand) on short-term nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions after a 50-mm late-spring simulated precipitation event. N2O emissions were measured daily for a week following the event. Soil NO3, temperature, physical properties and total N were also measured. N2O emissions peaked on the second day after a simulated rainfall event for all treatments. N2O losses were significantly higher on the clay loam compared to the loamy sand. Full season fertilizer application at planting on untilled soil resulted in 4.7 and 2.3 kg N ha(-1) greater cumulative N2O losses than starter-only fertilizer application on maize-after-grass and continuous maize, respectively. Under tilled conditions, cumulative N2O losses over a week averaged 0.88 kg N ha(-1) greater for the full fertilizer application compared to the starter-only application. Higher N2O losses from untilled soil were related to lower soil porosity and higher bulk density, and higher emissions under maize-after-grass were correlated with higher soil C levels. In conclusion, untilled soil and sod-based crop rotations increase late-spring N2O losses under maize production, especially with early fertilization. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Maize diversification and nitrogen fertilization effects on soil nitrous oxide emissions in irrigated mediterranean conditions. Maize is a major irrigated crop in Mediterranean areas and its typical intensive management may impact soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. In these irrigated continuous maize systems, the legumes incorporation as well as adjusted nitrogen (N) fertilization might be interesting strategies to reduce soil N2O emissions. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of cropping diversification and different N rates on soil N2O emissions in flooded irrigated maize under Mediterranean conditions. To achieve this, two cropping systems (maize monoculture system, MC; and pea -maize rotation, MP) and 3N rates (unfertilized, 0N; medium rate, MN; and high rate, HN) were evaluated in a field experiment established in NE Spain during 2 years (2019; 2020). During the studied period, the N rate had a significant effect on soil N2O emissions, with a non-linear positive response of cumulative soil N2O emissions to N rates. In both systems, quick and high increases of soil N2O fluxes were observed immediately after the N application reaching 55 and 100 mg N2O-N m(-2) day(-1) in MC and MP, respectively. Both years, the pea phase of the MP rotation showed greater cumulative N2O emissions than the fallow of MC. However, N2O losses in the maize phase were similar (2019) or even higher (2020) in MC than in MP. Moreover, in both seasons, the MN treatments showed lower yield-scaled N2O emissions and N emission factor than the HN treatments, being this last lower than 1% in all cases. The results obtained showed that in irrigated Mediterranean conditions the replacement of a fallow by a legume, together with an adjusted N fertilization are favourable strategies to mitigate soil N2O emissions in high-yielding maize systems.

Do Metals Increase or Decrease Nitrous Oxide Emissions and Maize Yields from Upland Soils?. Metals, including copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn), are associated with nitrous oxide (N2O) production processes, such as nitrification and denitrification. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of Cu, Fe, and Zn on N2O emissions and to determine cumulative N2O emission and crop yields from upland soils. Metals were applied at a rate of 20 kg ha(-1) in upland soil supporting maize (Zea mays L.) growth in 2018 and 2019. While the mean value of cumulative N2O emissions across both years was 5.19 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1) for the control soil, those of soil treated with Cu, Fe, and Zn were 3.37, 2.48, and 4.82 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Ammonium (NH4+) concentration in soil was highest after Fe application, and nitrate (NO3-) concentration was lowest. The copy number of the amoA gene related to NH4+ oxidation was lowest after Fe enhancement, implying that nitrification was inhibited. Furthermore, N2O emission decreased with Cu addition because the copy number of the nosZ gene associated with N2O reduction to N-2 was the highest. Because Cu and Fe decreased yield-scaled N2O emission, the application of either metal could reduce N2O emission per unit area of maize production, suggesting that both metals are beneficial soil amendments for reducing N2O emissions while maintaining maize yield.

The effect of chamber placement site on N2O emission under different fertilizer regimes from maize field. Static chamber method has been used to monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from agricultural soils. When monitoring GHG emission in rice or wheat systems, all the plant stems can be covered in the top chamber. Under this situation, both nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from the root free soils and the root area soils can be estimated. However, in maize field, most of the studies placed the chamber within the maize row due to the difficulty to cover the whole maize stalk. N2O emission from the root area was not estimated since the majority of maize roots were excluded in the chamber. This may lead to a under estimation of global N2O emission from maize cultivation. To evaluate the spatial variability of N2O emission from maize field, a two-year field experiment was conducted. N2O emissions from three sampling sites including inter-rows, within-rows and root area were monitored under five different fertilization regimes. Results showed that chamber placement site had a significant effect on the N2O emission during the maize growing season. Placing the chamber in inter-rows either overestimated or underestimated N2O emission. In 2018, N2O emission rate in the inter-rows was 69 % higher than the root area on average of the five treatments; whereas, in 2020, N2O emission rate in the inter-rows was 2.5 times lower than the root area. N fertilization regimes had a significant effect on N2O emission. On average of chamber sites, N2O emission under N fertilizer broadcasting was around 2 times lower compared to nest-applied. The highest N2O emission rate was observed when both basal and dressing N fertilizer were applied in a nest, which was 1.1-3.2 times higher than the other N fertilizer placement regimes. The N2O emission rate from the within-rows was close to the average value of the three sampling sites. Our results suggested that placing chamber in the center of two neighboring maize plants could represent the average area-scaled N2O emission in maize field.

Biochar increased potential nitrification rates when soil ammonium concentrations were high following fertilizer application, thus enhancing N2O emissions in the Biochar + Nitrogen treatment early in the season which were likely nitrification associated. However, over the full growing season, biochar application reduced cumulative N2O emissions in Biochar + Nitrogen plots to levels similar to the unamended Control. This could be attributed to biochar suppression of potential denitrification throughout the growing season. The treatments amended with biochar avoided large pulses of N2O emissions following intense rain events in the mid-season, while also sustaining lower N2O emissions in the late-season. Our study demonstrates that biochar can have dynamic effects on soil N2O emissions and the underlying microbial processes that depend on changing edaphic conditions, such as soil inorganic nitrogen availability and moisture, over the growing season.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from North American soybean production. The agricultural sector is responsible for substantial amounts of greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate climate change. Such greenhouse gas emissions from upland crops are difficult to abate because they are dominated by nitrous oxide (N2O) production from soil processes. Strategies to reduce these emissions focus on N fertilizer management, and there is a widespread assumption that legume crops, which do not receive N fertilizer, emit little N2O. Here we show that this assumption is incorrect; approximately 40% of N2O emissions from the most extensive cropping system in North America-the maize-soybean rotation-occur during the soybean phase. Yet, due to the lack of N fertilizer input, opportunities for emissions abatement from the soybean phase are unclear. Using models of cropping systems, we developed a strategy that combines cover-crop management and earlier planting of extended growth soybean varieties to reduce emissions from soybean production by 33%. These practices, which complement N fertilizer management in maize, are widely accessible and represent an immediate, climate-smart strategy to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from soybean production, thus not only contributing to climate-change mitigation but also maintaining productivity while adapting to changing weather patterns. Soil processes involved in agricultural practices emit considerable levels of nitrous oxide, which detrimentally contribute to climate change. This study explores strategies to reduce nitrous oxide emissions while maintaining crop productivity in the US maize-soybean rotational cropping system.

N2O emission from conventional and minimum-tilled soils. In this study, we investigated N2O emissions from two fields under minimum tillage, cropped with maize (MT maize) and summer oats (MT oats), and a conventionally tilled field cropped with maize (CT maize). Nitrous oxide losses from the MT maize and MT oats fields (5.27 and 3.64 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively) were significantly higher than those from the CT maize field (0.27 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) over a period of 1 year. The lower moisture content in CT maize (43% water-filled pore space [WFPS] compared to 60 -65%) probably caused the difference in total N2O emissions. Denitrification was found to be the major source of N2O loss. Emission factors calculated from the MT field data were high (0.04) compared to the CT field (0.001). All data were simulated with the denitrification decomposition model (DNDC). For the CT field, N2O and N2O+N-2 emissions were largely overestimated. For the MT fields, there was a better agreement with the total N2O and N2O+N-2 emissions, although the N2O emissions from the MT maize field were underestimated. The simulated N2O emissions were particularly influenced by fertilization, but several other measured N2O emission peaks associated with other management practices at higher WFPS were not captured by the model. Several mismatches between simulated and measured NH4+, NO3-and WFPS for all fields were observed. These mismatches together with the insensitivity of the DNDC model for increased N2O emissions at the management practices different from fertilizer application explain the limited similarity between the simulated and measured N2O emissions pattern from the MT fields.

Irrigation and tillage effects on soil nitrous oxide emissions in maize monoculture. Irrigation and soil management can impact soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Flood and sprinkler irrigation systems together with conventional tillage are the main practices used in the high yielding maize systems in Mediterranean Spain. The objective of this field work was to quantify the effect of the irrigation system (i.e., flood, F; and sprinkler, S) and the soil tillage system (i.e., conventional tillage, CT; no-tillage maintaining the maize stover, NTr; and no-tillage removing the maize stover, NT) on the N2O emissions from the soil during 3 yr (2015, 2016, and 2017). S irrigation, with mean values of 1.35 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) throughout the 3 yr, obtained 42% lower N2O emissions than F irrigation. On average of the three growing seasons, yield-scaled N2O emissions by grain yield and by grain N uptake in F irrigation were two-fold higher than in S irrigation. Moreover, in one out of three growing seasons (2017), no-tillage systems (i.e., NTr and NT) showed greater yield-scaled N2O emissions compared with CT. The higher maize grain yield with the S irrigation compared to F irrigation, as well as the lower N2O emissions reported under S irrigation resulted in the reduction of the yield-scaled N2O emissions. Our findings highlight the role of sprinkler irrigation decreasing N2O emissions in comparison to flood irrigation in Mediterranean agroecosystems.

The role of maize plants in regulating soil profile dynamics and surface emissions of nitrous oxide in a semiarid environment. To study the effects of maize plants on nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from a dryland experimental farm, in situ soil profiles of N2O concentrations and surface emissions were investigated in a field experiment from 2014 to 2015 in the semiarid areas of northwestern China. The experiment included four treatments: unplanted and N-unfertilized soil (C0), unplanted soil fertilized with 225 kg N ha(-1) (CN), maize-planted and N-unfertilized soil (P0), and maize-planted soil fertilized with 225 kg N ha(-1) (PN). Surface N2O emissions and soil N2O concentrations at depths of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cm were measured weekly. Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased the soil N2O concentrations and surface emissions. Compared to the unplanted soil, the presence of maize plants significantly decreased the N2O concentrations at depths of 10-40 cm during the maize growing season. The modeled N2O fluxes at a depth of 10 cm presented a similar pattern to the chamber measurements. However, there was a discrepancy between the concentration gradient and chamber methods when the fluxes were high, mainly because the gradient method could not detect N2O production and consumption process above the uppermost gas sampler (0-10 cm). Soil moisture and temperature were critical factors affecting the N2O concentrations and surface emissions. The respective cumulative surface emissions and effluxes at a depth of 10 cm during the maize growing season (PN treatment) were decreased by 8.9 and 17.9% in 2014 and by 14.7 and 17.5% in 2015 compared to values of the CN treatment. This was mainly due to the decrease in soil moisture caused by the growth of the maize plants, which resulted in a soil condition less suitable for N2O production.

Nitrapyrin Mitigates Nitrous Oxide Emissions, and Improves Maize Yield and Nitrogen Efficiency under Waterlogged Field. In order to explore the effects of nitrapyrin (N-Serve) application on greenhouse gas emission and nitrogen (N) leaching of a waterlogged maize (Zea mays L.) field, we investigated the effects of applying nitrapyrin on soil ammonium (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) content, nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and the warming potential (GWP(N2O)) in a waterlogged maize field. The design included three treatments: waterlogging treatment with only urea application (V-3WL), waterlogging treatment with urea and nitrapyrin application (V-3WL+N), and no waterlogging treatment applying only urea (CK). Our results revealed that waterlogging led to the increase of nitrate concentrations across the soil profile, thus potentially increasing N leaching and decreasing N use efficiency. The accumulated N2O emissions increased significantly in waterlogged plots compared to control plots, and maximum N2O emission fluxes occurred during the process of soil drying after waterlogging; this resulted in an increase in GWP(N2O) and N2O greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI(N2O)) by 299% and 504%, respectively, compared to those of CK. However, nitrapyrin application was able to reduce N2O emissions. Nitrapyrin application was also good for decreasing GWP(N2O) and GHGI(N2O) by 34% and 50%, respectively, compared to V-3WL. In addition, nitrapyrin application was conducive to reduce N leaching and improve N use efficiency, resulting in a yield increase by 34%, compared to that of V-3WL. The application of nitrapyrin helped to mitigate agriculture-source greenhouse effects and N leaching induced by waterlogging, and was a high N-efficient fertilizer method for a waterlogged field.

Monitoring of greenhouse gases from soil during two cropping seasons of maize in a Mediterranean environment. A challenge for agriculture is to individuate strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from soil while preserving crop yield. Agricultural practices are reported to affect carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from soil due to their effects on nutrient cycling and soil conditions (e.g. soil water content, soil temperature etc.). A field campaign was carried out to measure the effect of reducing irrigation level (drip irrigation, rainfed) and N fertilizer rate (170 kg N ha(-1), 130 kg N ha(-1), 0 kg N ha(-1)) on GHG emissions from soil and on crop yield on maize cultivated in Tuscany region (Italy). Main result highlighted that decreasing N fertilization of about 20% reduced cumulative N2O emissions (on average -42%) without decreasing the crop productivity, indicating that improving the N use efficiency could be the best strategy to reduce GHG emissions from soil cultivated with maize in our environment.

Effects of fertilizer type on nitrous oxide emission and ammonia volatilization in wheat and maize crops. About half of the applied nitrogen (N) is not consumed by crops, causing environmental and economic costs. This N can be lost as ammonia (NH3) volatilization, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission or leaching, among others. This work aimed to compare the amount of gaseous N losses using three different fertilizers on two consecutive experiments: one summer crop (maize) and one winter crop (wheat) in the Rolling Pampa, Argentina. The fertilizers used were urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and AN+DMPP (ammonium nitrate-based NPK fertilizer with DMPP nitrification inhibitor). NH3 emissions were estimated using a semi open-static absorption system during the first month after fertilization for each experiment. N2O emissions were estimated using vented static chambers during the growing season of each crop. Results show that CAN or AN+DMPP fertilizers used instead of UAN helped to reduce NH3 volatilization by 45-50% and 62-63% on maize and wheat experiments respectively, but failed to reduce N2O emissions. In addition, contrary to the expected, AN+DMPP increased N2O emissions during the maize experiment. The majority of the gaseous N losses occurred at specific moments of the crop cycle (after N fertilization and around leaf senescence). Losses as NH3 volatilization were higher than N2O emissions in the maize experiment, as expected because of the warmer temperature during this summer crop. However, N2O emissions were higher during the wheat crop, emphasizing the importance of factors such as meteorological conditions, previous land-use, residual soil nitrate and stubble quality on the soil.

Nitrous oxide emission from soils amended with crop residues. Crop residues incorporated in soil are a potentially important source of nitrous oxide (N2O), though poorly quantified. Here, we report on the N2O emission from 10 crop residues added to a sandy and a clay soil, both with and without additional nitrate (NO3). In the sandy soil, total N2O emission from wheat, maize, and barley residues was not significantly different from the control. The total N2O emission from white cabbage, Brussels sprouts, mustard, sugar beet residues and broccoli ranged from 0.13 to 14.6% of the amount of N added as residue and were higher with additional NO than without additional NO. In the clay soil, similar effects of crop residues were found, but the magnitude of the N2O emission was much smaller than that in the sandy soil: less than 1 % of the residue N evolved as N2O. The C-to-N ratio of the residue accounted for only 22-34% and the mineralizable N content of the residue for 18-74% of the variance in N2O emission. We suggest that the current IPCC methodology for estimating N2O emission from crop residues may be considerably improved by defining crop specific emission factors instead of one emission factor for all crop residues.

Effects of biochar addition on nitrous oxide emission during soil freeze-thaw cycles. Biochar applied to soil can reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions produced by freeze-thaw processes. Nonetheless, how biochar modification affects N2O emissions during freeze-thaw cycles is not completely clear. In our research, during freeze-thaw cycles, microcosm experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of maize straw biochar (MB) or rice straw biochar (RB) addition on soil N2O emissions under different water conditions. The N2O emissions peaked at the initial stage of thawing in all the soils, and the total N2O emissions were considerably greater in the flooded soils than in the nonflooded soils. Compared with the soils without biochar addition, RB and MB amendments inhibited N2O emissions by 69 and 67%, respectively. Moreover, after biochar addition, the abundance of AOB amoA genes decreased by 9-13%. Biochar addition significantly decreased the content of microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) in flooded soil during thawing, which was significantly correlated with N2O emissions and nitrification and denitrification communities. The PLS-PM further revealed that biochar can inhibit the production and emission of soil N2O by reducing soil MBN during soil thawing. In addition, soil moisture directly significantly affects N2O emissions and indirectly affects N2O emissions through its influence on soil physicochemical properties. Our results revealed the important function of biochar in decreasing the emission of N2O in flooded soil during freeze-thaw cycles.

Contribution and Driving Mechanism of N2O Emission Bursts in a Chinese Vegetable Greenhouse after Manure Application and Irrigation. Solar greenhouse vegetable fields have been found to be hotspots of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in China, mainly due to excessive manure application and irrigation. Pulses of N2O emissions have been commonly reported by field monitoring works conducted in greenhouse fields, though their significance regarding total N2O emissions and the driving mechanism behind them remain poorly understood. N2O fluxes were monitored in situ using a static opaque chamber method in a typical greenhouse vegetable field. Then, laboratory incubations were conducted under different soil moisture and manure application gradients to monitor nitrous oxide emissions and related soil properties, using a robotized incubation system. Field monitoring showed that the occurrence of clear N2O emission bursts closely followed fertilization and irrigation events, accounting for 76.7% of the annual N2O efflux. The soil N2O flux increased exponentially with the water-filled pore space (WFPS), causing extremely high N2O emissions when the WFPS was higher than 60%. During the lab incubation, emission bursts led to N2O peaks within 40 h, synchronously changing with the transit soil NO2-. An integrated analysis of the variations in the gas emission and soil properties indicated that the denitrification of transit NO2- accumulation was the major explanation for N2O emission bursts in the greenhouse filed. Nitrous oxide emission bursts constituted the major portion of the N2O emissions in the Chinese greenhouse soils. Nitrite (NO2-) denitrification triggered by fertilization and irrigation was responsible for these N2O emission pulses. Our results clarified the significance and biogeochemical mechanisms of N2O burst emissions; this knowledge could help us to devise and enact sounder N2O mitigation measures, which would be conducive to sustainable development in vegetable greenhouse fields.

Crop residues integration with nitrogen rates reduces yield-scaled nitrous oxide emissions and improves maize yield and soil quality. Maize production requires a large amount of nitrogen (N). However, a greater part of the N used gets lost to the environment as reactive forms including nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O emissions and associated soil-related factors were measured in a maize (Zea mays L.) field in the 5(th) crop after initiation of the experiment in an annual maize-rice sequence. The treatments comprised two levels of crop residues (no residue, NR vs. 30 cm residue, CR) with four levels of N fertilizers (control; farmers' practice, FP; national recommended dose, RD, and 125% of RD, 1.25 RD). Mean and cumulative N2O emissions increased with N rate coupled with either residue level. The CR coupled with 1.25 RD had 10% higher N2O emissions than the same rate as NR. In contrast, yield-scaled N2O emissions were equal in 1.25 RD coupled with either residue level. However, higher N2O emissions in CR than in NR can be offset by the corresponding improvement in soil elemental quality, e.g. soil organic carbon, total N, P, K and S. The N2O emission factor, ranged from 0.99 to 1.34, and was higher in CR coupled with 1.25 RD than in any other combination suggesting that optimization of N rate is one of the best options to reduce N2O emissions. Maize grain yield was higher in RD and 1.25 RD than in the farmers' practice where the former two were similar to each other. Step-wise multiple regression showed that N application rate, soil organic carbon, total N and pH are the dominant factors controlling N2O emissions. Our results suggest that maize production can benefit from residue retention with the current N rate (RD) for better yield, soil quality and N2O mitigation. C1 [Rahman, M.

Seasonal N2O emissions respond differently to environmental and microbial factors after fertilization in wheat-maize agroecosystem. Biogeochemical processes regulating cropland soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are complex, and the controlling factors need to be better understood, especially for seasonal variation after fertilization. Seasonal patterns of N2O emissions and abundances of archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), bacterial amoA, nitrate reductase (narG), nitrite reductase (nirS/nirK), and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) genes in long-term fertilized wheat-maize soils have been studied to understand the roles of microbes in N2O emissions. The results showed that fertilization greatly stimulated N2O emission with higher values in pig manure-treated soil (OM, 2.88kgNha(-1)year(-1)) than in straw-returned (CRNPK, 0.79kgNha(-1)year(-1)) and mineral fertilizer-treated (NPK, 0.90kgNha(-1)year(-1)) soils. Most (52.2-88.9%) cumulative N2O emissions occurred within 3weeks after fertilization. Meanwhile, N2O emissions within 3weeks after fertilization showed a positive correlation with narG gene copy number and a negative correlation with soil NO3- contents. The abundances of narG and nosZ genes had larger direct effects (1.06) than ammonium oxidizers (0.42) on N2O emissions according to partial least squares path modeling. Stepwise multiple regression also showed that log narG was a predictor variable for N2O emissions. This study suggested that denitrification was the major process responsible for N2O emissions within 3weeks after fertilization. During the remaining period of crop growth, insufficient N substrate and low temperature became the primary limiting factors for N2O emission according to the results of the regression models.

Effects of Pig Manure Compost Application Timing (Spring/Autumn) on N2O Emissions and Maize Yields in Northeast China. Animal manure application is widely recognized for its agronomic benefits in enhancing soil fertility and crop productivity through organic matter enrichment and nutrient supply, but the critical application time governing its greenhouse gas emission trade-offs remains unresolved. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of pig manure compost application timing on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and maize yields in Northeast China through a four-year field experiment. The treatments included: (1) inorganic fertilizers (NPK); (2) NPK plus pig manure compost applied in spring (NPK-MS); and (3) NPK plus pig manure compost applied in autumn (NPK-MA). The N2O fluxes, NH4+-N contents, NO3--N contents, and maize yields were analyzed. The results showed that compared with NPK, NPK-MA increased N2O emissions by 44.4%. Applying pig manure compost in autumn promotes N2O emissions during the freeze-thaw period. However, there was no significant effect of NPK-MS on N2O emissions compared with NPK (p > 0.05). Spring-applied manure compost (NPK-MS) resulted in an 11.9% increase in maize yield compared to NPK. In contrast, autumn-applied manure compost (NPK-MA) did not significantly affect maize yield (p > 0.05). Furthermore, yield-scaled N2O emissions were significantly increased in NPK-MA (p < 0.05). Overall, spring application of pig manure compost is recommended for increasing maize yield without significantly increasing N2O emissions while in Northeast China.

The influence of management and environmental variables on soil N2O emissions in a crop system in Southern Italy. Soil N2O emissions were monitored throughout a 3-year crop rotation including maize, fennel and a ryegrass-clover sward, at Borgo Cioffi NitroEurope site. N2O emission rates were highly variable in time and space and controlled by soil nitrogen and soil water content. The N2O effluxes were low for most of the monitored period. The highest N2O emissions were recorded throughout the 2007 maize cropping season, ranged form 15.2 to 196.2 mu g m(-2) h(-1) whereas the lowest ones ranged form -5 to 10 mu g m(-2) h(-1) during the 2007-2008 ryegrass-clover winter crop. For the maize crops, N2O peaks were detected after fertilization but with a delay of some weeks from applications, probably due to the presence of DMPP nitrification inhibitor in the applied fertilizer. A properly designed ANOVA model was developed to explain the influence of the main chemical-physical factors. This model also allowed the quantification of the delay time in peak emissions following fertilization, which resulted variable over the years and ranged between 2 and 21 days. A dependence of emissions from soil temperature and moisture was found, with significant interactions in some instances. Calculated Emission Factors (maize 2007: 0.48%; ryegrass-clover sward 2007-2008: 0.05%; maize 2008: 0.14%; fennel: 0.28% 2008-2009; maize 2009: 0.015%) resulted well below the values reported in the literature and the 1% reference value indicated by IPCC, probably due to a sub-optimal water regime inducing low Water Filled Pore Space (WFPS) values.

Evaluation of the Agronomic Impacts on Yield-Scaled N2O Emission from Wheat and Maize Fields in China. Contemporary crop production faces dual challenges of increasing crop yield while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emission. An integrated evaluation of the mitigation potential of yield-scaled nitrous oxide ( N2O) emission by adjusting cropping practices can benefit the innovation of climate smart cropping. This study conducted a meta-analysis to assess the impact of cropping systems and soil management practices on area-and yield-scaled N2O emissions during wheat and maize growing seasons in China. Results showed that the yield-scaled N2O emissions of winter wheat-upland crops rotation and single spring maize systems were respectively 64.6% and 40.2% lower than that of winter wheat-rice and summer maize-upland crops rotation systems. Compared to conventional N fertilizer, application of nitrification inhibitors and controlled-release fertilizers significantly decreased yield-scaled N2O emission by 41.7% and 22.0%, respectively. Crop straw returning showed no significant impacts on area-and yield-scaled N2O emissions. The effect of manure on yield-scaled N2O emission highly depended on its application mode. No tillage significantly increased the yield-scaled N2O emission as compared to conventional tillage. The above findings demonstrate that there is great potential to increase wheat and maize yields with lower N2O emissions through innovative cropping technique in China.

Closing maize yield gaps in sub-Saharan Africa will boost soil N2O emissions. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the most important staple crop is maize; the production of which is dominated by smallholder farming systems using low external inputs (<10 kg N ha(-1)) resulting in low crop yields and large yield gaps (difference between actual and potential yields). To assess increases in soil N2O emissions when closing maize yield gaps by increased fertilizer use, we reviewed the literature, developed a relationship between yield gaps and soil N2O emissions, and used it to scale across SSA. According to our analysis, N2O emissions from maize production will increase from currently 255 to 1755 1226 Gg N2O-N year(-1) (+589%) if existing maize yield gaps are closed by 75%, increasing total anthropogenic N2O emissions for SSA by c. 50%.

Nitrous Oxide and Methane Emissions in Spring Maize Field in the Semi-Arid Regions of Loess Plateau. A 2-year field study was conducted to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) in a rain-fed spring maize cropland in the Loess Plateau, P. R. China, and to determine the effects of optimized nitrogen (N) fertilization practices on urea-derived N2O emission factor (EF), grain yield, net greenhouse gas (NGHG) emission, and net greenhouse gas intensity (NGHGI). Five treatments were considered, including control (CK), conventional N fertilization (Con), optimal N fertilization (Opt), optimal N fertilization plus nitrification inhibitor (Opt+DCD), and optimal N fertilization with slow release urea (Opt+SR). Soil acted as a small sink for atmospheric CH4. Nitrogen fertilization and heavy rainfall events (>40mm) were the main factors controlling N2O emissions. The annual mean EF ranged from 0.12 to 0.55%. Compared to conventional N fertilizer, nitrification inhibitor decreased the annual cumulative N2O, NGHG, and NGHGI emissions by 45, 52, and 48%, respectively, without decreasing grain yield. In conclusion, nitrification inhibitor addition was the most effective practice to reduce N2O emissions in the rain-fed regions of Loess Plateau.

Environmental performance indicators for nitrogen. The Centre for Agriculture and environment (CLM) has developed 'enviromental performance indicators' (EPIs) for the nitrogen surplus and the emission of nitrous oxide. The EPI for the nitrogen surplus is an element of the yardstick for mineral accounting while the other is used int he yardstick for energy accounting. the nitrogen surplus is calculated using farm figures for inputs and outputs of nitrogen. For the emission of nitrous oxide from soils, two calculation methods have been developed, i.e. a simple and a complex method. Calculation of both EPIs has been carried out for energy cropping and for dairy farming. For energy crops, nitrogen surplus ranges from 58 kg nitrogen per ha for hemp to 196 kg nitrogen per ha for silage maize (reference crop: 40 kg nitrogen per ha). For the emission of nitrous oxide, both methods lead to similar results, ranging form 0.7 kg N2O-N per ha for miscanthus to 4.0 kg N2O-N per ha for silage maize (reference: 0.9 kg N2O-N per ha). For dairy farming, nitrous oxide is emitted directly from fertilisation of soils, including artificial fertiliser and manure, from grazing and indirectly from the purchase of cattle feed cultivated elsewhere. Total emission of nitrous oxide from dairy farms ranges from 3.5 kg N2O-N per ha to 18.9 kg N2O-N per ha. The major contribution comes from fertilisation, while emissions from using deposition and purchase of cattle feed only add relatively small amounts. It was concluded that the complex method is more suitable to calculate the emission of nitrous oxide from soils. Mineral and energy accounting show that nitrogen surplus and emissions of nitrous oxide may be substantially reduced by improvements in nitrogen management. More research is needed to assess emission factors for nitrous oxide, and to develop management practices to reduce the emissions.

Comparison between observed and DeNitrification-DeComposition model-based nitrous oxide fluxes and maize yields under selected soil fertility management technologies in Kenya. Aims Process-based biogeochemical models can be used to simulate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and maize yields and draw insights on yields improvement and climate change mitigation options. We compared both observed and DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) simulated soil N2O fluxes and maize yields. Methods We used DNDC model to simulate soil N2O fluxes and maize yields under four soil fertility treatments (inorganic fertiliser, animal manure, animal manure + inorganic fertiliser and control,) replicated thrice for 1 year in Central Highlands of Kenya. We sampled soil N2O fluxes using static chambers installed in each plot. We analysed soil N2O using gas chromatography and calculated cumulative fluxes using trapezoidal rule linear interpolation between sampling dates. Results DNDC showed poor results in simulating daily N2O fluxes (157.16% <= normalised root mean square error (nRMSE) <= 324.01% and 0.90 <= modelling efficiency (NSE) <= 0.96), good to excellent performance in simulating cumulative annual soil N2O fluxes (6.16 <= nRMSE <= 12.86 and 0.63 <= NSE <= 0.86) and good to excellent performance in simulating maize yields (1.15% <= nRMSE <= 13.86% and 0.51 <= NSE <= 0.88) across all soil fertility treatments. Conclusion The DNDC model had good to excellent performance in simulating cumulative soil N2O fluxes and crop yields across treatments. Though the model captured yield-scaled N2O fluxes and N2O emission factors across treatments, they were underestimated under manure treatment. There is a need to continue calibrating the DNDC model for improved capture of daily N2O fluxes and uptakes on Kenyan soils.

Effect of Biochar and Straw Application on Nitrous Oxide and Methane Emissions from Eutric Regosols with Different pH in Sichuan Basin: A Mesocosm Study. Adoption of crop residue amendments has been increasingly recommended as an effective management practice for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing soil fertility, thereby increasing crop production. However, the effect of biochar and straw on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions in soils of differing pH remains poorly understood. Three treatments (control (i.e., no amendment), maize straw, and biochar derived from maize straw) were therefore established separately in soils with different pH levels, classified as follows: acidic, neutral, and alkaline. N2O and CH4 were investigated using a static chamber-gas chromatography system during 57 days of a mesocosm study. The results showed that cumulative N2O emissions were significantly higher in acidic soils than in other experimental soils, with the values ranging from 7.48 to 11.3 kg N ha(-1), while CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.060 to 0.089 kg C ha(-1), with inconclusive results. However, a weak negative correlation was observed between log N2O and log NO3-N in acidic soil with either biochar or straw, while the same parameters with CH4 showed a moderate negative correlation, suggesting a likelihood that these amendments could mitigate GHGs as a result of the NO3-N increase in acidic soils. It is also possible, given the alkaline nature of the biochar, that incorporation had a significant buffer effect on soil acidity, effectively increasing soil pH by >0.5 pH units. Our findings suggest that for the rates of application for biochar and straw used in this study, the magnitude of reductions in the emissions of N2O and CH4 are dependent in part on initial soil pH.

The impact of slurry application technique on nitrous oxide emission from agricultural soils. Direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from fertilized soils are generally estimated using emission factors. However, the emission factors for N2O emission of applied slurry are not well quantified. The effect of slurry application technique on N2O emission was quantified in field experiments in the Netherlands in order to derive N2O emission factors for (shallow) injected and surface-applied cattle and pig slurries. Fluxes of N2O were measured using a closed flux chamber technique and a photo-acoustic infra-red gasmonitor. Fluxes of N2O were measured 64-83 times on grassland on sandy and clay soils and maize land on sandy soil, in the period 2007-2009. There were large differences in total N2O emission between the years, and differences between treatments were not consistent over the years and sites. The average emission factor of all treatments and years (n = 35) was 0.9% of the N applied, which is close to the default IPCC emission factor of 1%. However, the range in emission was large, i.e. from -0.2% to 7.0%. The average emission factor for grassland was 1.7% of the N applied for calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN), 0.4% for shallow injected cattle slurry, and 0.1% for surface-applied cattle slurry. For maize land, the average emission factor for CAN was 0.1% of the N applied, for injected cattle slurry 0.9% and for surface-applied cattle slurry 0.4%. The emission factors for pig slurry applied to maize land were higher than for cattle slurry; 3.6% for injected pig slurry and 0.9% for surface-applied pig slurry. Increasing the N application rate on maize land resulted in higher emission factors for CAN, injected cattle slurry, and injected pig slurry. Concluding, on both grassland and maize land (shallow) injection of slurry increased the average emission factor of N2O in comparison to surface application. Differentiation of N2O emission factors which takes specific factors into account, such as N type and rate and application technique, can improve the quantification of N2O emission from agricultural soils and is needed to derive most efficient options for mitigation.

Parameterization, calibration and validation of the DNDC model for carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and maize crop performance estimation in East Africa. Dynamic biogeochemical models are crucial tools for simulating the complex interaction between soils, climate and plants; thus the need for improving understanding of nutrient cycling and reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the environment. This study aimed to calibrate and validate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model for soil moisture, temperature, respiration, nitrous oxide and maize crop growth simulation in drier sub-humid parts of the central highlands of Kenya. We measured soil GHG fluxes from a maize field under four different soil fertility management practices for one year using static chambers and gas chromatography. Using experimental data collected from four management practices during GHG sampling period, we parameterized the DNDC model. The results indicate that the DNDC model simulates daily and annual soil moisture, soil temperature, soil respiration (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), N2O yield-scaled emissions (YSE), N2O emission factors (EFs) and maize crop growth with a high degree of fitness. However, the DNDC simulations slightly underestimated soil temperature (2-6%), crop growth (2-45%) and N2O emissions (5-23%). The simulation over-estimated soil moisture (9-17%) and CO2 emissions (3-10%). It however, perfectly simulated YSE and EFs. Compared to the observed/measured annual GHG trends, the simulation results were relatively good, with an almost perfect fitting of emission peaks during soil rewetting at the onset of rains, coinciding with soil fertilisation. These findings provide reliable information in selecting best farm management practice, which simultaneously improves agricultural productivity and reduces GHG emissions, thus permitting climate-smart agriculture. The good DNDC simulated YSE and EFs values (Tier III) provide cheaper and reliable ways of filling the huge GHG data gap, reducing uncertainties in national GHG inventories and result to efficient targeting of mitigation measures in sub-Saharan Africa.

Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice and maize production in diversified rice cropping systems. Traditional irrigated double-rice cropping systems have to cope with reduced water availability due to changes of climate and economic conditions. To quantify the shift in CH4 and N2O emissions when changing from traditional to diversified double cropping-systems, an experiment including flooded rice, non-flooded \"aerobic\" rice and maize was conducted during the dry season (February-June 2012) in the Philippines. Two automated static chamber-GC systems were used to continuously measure CH4 and N2O emissions in the three cropping systems of which each included three different nitrogen fertilization regimes. Turning away from flooded cropping systems leads to shifts in greenhouse gas emissions from CH4 under wet soil to N2O emissions under drier soil conditions. The global warming potential (GWP) of the non-flooded crops was lower compared to flooded rice, whereas high CH4 emissions under flooded conditions still override enhanced N2O emissions in the upland systems. The yield-scaled GWP favored maize over aerobic rice, due to lower yields of aerobic rice. However, the lower GHG emissions of upland systems are only beneficial if they are not overwhelmed by enhanced losses of soil organic carbon.

Nitrous oxide emissions and emission factors in hairy vetch-maize sequences: The role of vetch termination timing on nitrogen synchronization. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils represent a major environmental concern and require sustainable nitrogen (N) management strategies. The timing of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) termination was investigated to improve N synchronization and to assess its potential to replace fallow as an alternative N source for maize (Zea mays L.) without increasing N2O emissions compared to urea, while maintaining productivity. An experiment was conducted over two seasons to assess N2O emissions (43 measurements per season) and soil N dynamics in fallow/maize and vetch/maize sequences with two termination timings. Cumulative N2O emissions in vetch/maize sequence ranged from 0.59 to 1.77 kg N2O-N ha(-1) , while in fallow/maize ranged from 0.55 to 1.18 kg N2O-N ha(-1) . Nitrogen fertilization increased emissions by 4.5-17.6 %, while the use of vetch before maize increased them by 9.6-48.5 % compared to fallow/maize sequence. Reducing the interval between vetch termination and maize sowing from similar to 31 days (early termination) to similar to 10 days (late termination) improved N synchronization by 13 %. Late vetch termination and N-fertilized fallow showed similar N2O emissions, with improved synchronization reducing emissions by 13-21 % compared to early termination. Regression trees identified soil temperature, ammonium, and water-filled pore space (WFPS) as key drivers of N2O emissions during the fallow or vetch period, whereas nitrate and WFPS became the dominant factors during the maize season. Furthermore, the first emission factors for hairy vetch (< 0.17 %) were reported, which were significantly lower than the IPCC default (1 %). These findings offer critical insights into refining greenhouse gas inventories and optimizing vetch management to reduce emissions while maintaining or enhancing maize productivity.

Addition of Chemical and Natural Urease Inhibitors in Reducing Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide Losses. To examine the reduction of ammonia (NH3) volatilisation, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and production of grain yield in maize from urea fertiliser with the addition of chemical and natural urease inhibitors, a field experiment was conducted for one growing season of maize on sandy soil at Jabatan Pertanian Perak, Malaysia. Four replicates of three treatments: Urea (control), urea coated with thiosulfinate (UThiol) and urea coated with triamida N-(n-butil) tiofosforica, known as NBPT (UNBPT). After fertiliser application, NH3 volatilisation, N2O emission and grain yield were monitored at different timing. The NH3 volatilisation was determined using the Draeger tube method while N2O emission was discovered using the closed chamber technique. UNBPT showed the lowest NH3 volatilisation as compared with urea, followed by UThiol. For N2O emission, there is no significant difference between UNBPT and UThiol but both treatments recorded significant difference with Urea (control). The maize production exhibited a positive significant result by increasing the maize yield in UNBPT and UThiol than Urea (control) treatment. These results suggest that using natural inhibitor may have the most potential to reduce N losses and improve yield nearly as efficiently as chemical inhibitor.

Emission of N2O from Biogas Crop Production Systems in Northern Germany. There is a growing concern that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during agricultural energy crop production might negate GHG emission savings which was not intended when promoting the use of renewable energy. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a major GHG, and in addition, it is the most powerful ozone-depleting compound that is emitted by human activity. The use of N fertilizers and animal manures is the main anthropogenic source of N2O emissions. In spite of their high relevance, we still have limited understanding of the complex underlying microbial processes that consume or produce N2O and their interactions with soil types, fertilizers (rate and types), plants, and other environmental variables. In a 2-year field experiment, we compared two important biogas crops in two different agro-ecological regions of northern Germany for their productivity and GHG emissions, using the closed-chamber technique and high time-resolution sampling. Silage maize, which is currently the most widespread crop grown for biogas fermentation purposes in Germany, was compared with an alternative bioenergy crop at each site. The three forms of nitrogen fertilizers/manures were given: calcium ammonium nitrate, cattle/pig slurry, and biogas residue. The greatest N2O flux activity occurred in the period of May-July in all crops and at both sites. Flux patterns indicated pronounced effects of soil moisture-soil mineral-N interactions which were also seen as causation of the higher N2O fluxes in the bioenergy crop maize compared to the other tested energy crops. However, the N2O emission per unit methane production (specific N2O emission) was clearly lower in soils planted with maize due to significantly higher methane hectare yield of maize. Our data suggest a linear relationship between increasing N input and increases in N2O emission in both years at site with sandy loam texture where highest N2O fluxes were measured. At sandy loam site, the percentage of applied N being emitted as N2O was 1.9 and 1.1 % in soils cropped with maize and 0.9 and 0.8 % in soils cropped with wheat during the investigation period 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, respectively. In contrast, at site with sandy soil texture, the percentage of applied N emitted as N2O was only 0.6 and 0.7 % in maize soils and 0.4 and 0.3 % in grassland during 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 period, respectively. Higher daily and annual N2O emissions at the sandy loam site were attributed to the finer soil texture and higher denitrification activity.

Response of nitrous oxide emission to soil mulching and nitrogen fertilization in semi-arid farmland. Plastic film and gravel mulching have long been used to improve crop production, but few studies have focused on the effects of these mulching practices on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Understanding the response of N2O emission to soil surface mulching is beneficial for improving management practices. We performed two field experiments over two years in northwestern China to measure the annual N2O emissions using the static chamber technique: first, we compared the N2O emissions from non-mulched (BP), gravel-mulched (GM) and plastic film-mulched (FM) maize (Zea mays L.) fields that received an equivalent nitrogen (N) application rate; second, we monitored the N2O emissions from film-mulched maize fields that received different N application rates [N applied at 0 (NO), 250 (N250) and 380 (N380) kg N ha(-1)]. Compared to the BP treatment, both the GM and FM treatments markedly improved the soil temperature and moisture, Which significantly increased the maize yields and N uptake but did not increase the N(2)Oemissions, most likely because the decreased soil mineral N content limited the N2O production. As a result, the yield-scaled N2O emissions were markedly reduced in the GM and FM treatments, and a greater reduction was observed in the FM treatment due to the higher grain yield. The N(2)Oemissions persistently increased with an increasing N rate, but the grain yield peaked in the N250 treatment in which the N input was nearly equivalent to the maize N uptake. Consequently, low yield-scaled N2O emissions were obtained in the N250 treatment (125 and 155 g N2O-N Mg-1 grain in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, respectively). Thus, we conclude that film mulching combined with an appropriate N input is a preferable management practice to improve the grain yield and to simultaneously minimize the direct N2O emission intensity in agriculture.

Nitrous oxide emissions from silage maize fields under different mineral nitrogen fertilizer and slurry applications. Intensive dairy farming systems are a large source of emission of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), because of high nitrogen (N) application rates to grasslands and silage maize fields. The objective of this study was to compare measured N2O emissions from two different soils to default N2O emission factors, and to look at alternative emission factors based on (i) the N uptake in the crop and (ii) the N surplus of the system, i.e., N applied minus N uptake by the crop. Twelve N fertilization regimes were implemented on a sandy soil (typic endoaquoll) and a clay soil (typic endoaquept) in the Netherlands, and N2O emissions were measured throughout the growing season. Highest cumulative fluxes of 1.92 and 6.81 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the sandy soil and clay soil were measured at the highest slurry application rate of 250 kg N ha(-1). Background emissions from unfertilized soils were 0.14 and 1.52 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the sandy soil and the clay soil, respectively. Emission factors for the sandy soil averaged 0.08, 0.51 and 0.26% of the N applied via fertilizer, slurry, and combinations of both. For the clay soil, these numbers were 1.18, 1.21 and 1.69%, respectively. Surplus N was linearly related to N2O emission for both the sandy soil (R-2 = 0.60) and the clay soil (R-2 = 0.40), indicating a possible alternative emission factor. We concluded that, in our study, N2O emission was not linearly related to N application rates, and varied with type and application rate of fertilizer. Finally, the relatively high emission from the clay soil indicates that background emissions might have to be taken into account in N2O budgets.

POSTHARVEST NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM A SUBTROPICAL OXISOL AS INFLUENCED BY SUMMER CROP RESIDUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most important non-CO2 greenhouse gas and soil management systems should be evaluated for their N2O mitigation potential. This research evaluated a long-term (22 years) experiment testing the effect of soil management systems on N2O emissions in the postharvest period (autumn) from a subtropical Rhodic Hapludox at the research center FUNDACEP, in Cruz Alta, state of Rio Grande do Sul. Three treatments were evaluated, one under conventional tillage with soybean residues (CTsoybean) and two under no-tillage with soybean (NTsoybean) and maize residues (NTmaize). N2O emissions were measured eight times within 24 days (May 2007) using closed static chambers. Gas flows were obtained based on the relations between gas concentrations in the chamber at regular intervals (0, 15, 30,45 min) analyzed by gas chromatography. After soybean harvest, accumulated N2O emissions in the period were approximately three times higher in the untilled soil (164 mg m(-2) N) than under CT (51 mg m(-2) N), with a short-lived N2O peak of 670 mg m(-2) h(-1) N. In contrast, soil N2O emissions in NT were lower after maize than after soybean, with a N2O peak of 127 g m(-2) h(-1) N. The multivariate analysis of N2O fluxes and soil variables, which were determined simultaneously with air sampling, demonstrated that the main driving variables of soil N2O emissions were soil microbial activity, temperature, water-filled pore space, and NO3- content. To replace soybean monoculture, crop rotation including maize must be considered as a strategy to decrease soil N2O emissions from NT soils in Southern Brazil in a Autumn.

Effects of animal manure and nitrification inhibitor on N2O emissions and soil carbon stocks of a maize cropping system in Northeast China. The incorporation of animal manure (AM) in soil plays an essential role in soil carbon sequestration but might induce higher soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The use of nitrification inhibitors (NI) is an effective strategy to abate N2O emission in agro-ecosystems. However, very few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of applying NI under the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers for increasing soil carbon sequestration and reducing N2O emissions simultaneously in Northeast China. Here, a four-year field experiment was conducted with three treatments [inorganic fertilizer (NPK), inorganic fertilizer + manure (NPKM), and inorganic fertilizer with NI + manure (NPKI + M)], in a rainfed maize cropping system in Northeast China. Plots of different treatments were kept in the same locations for 4 years. Gas samples were collected using the static closed chamber technique, and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentration in gas samples was quantified using a gas chromatograph. Soil organic carbon sequestration rate (SOCSR) was calculated based on the changes in SOC from April 2012 to October 2015. Averaged over the four years, AM incorporation significantly increased soil N2O emissions by 25.8% (p < 0.05), compared to NPK treatment. DMPP (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate) significantly decreased N2O emissions by 32.5% (p < 0.05) relative to NPKM treatment. SOC content was significantly elevated by 24.1% in the NPKI + M treatment than the NPK treatment after four years of manure application (p < 0.05). The annual topsoil SOCSR for the NPKM and NPKI + M treatments was 0.57 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 1.02 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, which were significantly higher than that of NPK treatment (- 0.61 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), p < 0.05). AM addition significantly increased the aboveground biomass and crop yields of maize in the fourth year. Overall, combined application of DMPP, inorganic fertilizer and AM is strongly recommended in this rainfed maize cropping system, which can increase maize yield and SOC sequestration rate, and mitigate N2O emission.

Modeling Nitrous Oxide Emissions From Large-Scale Intensive Cropping Systems in the Southern Amazon. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer use is rapidly intensifying on tropical croplands and has the potential to increase emissions of the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O). Since about 2005 Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil has shifted from single-cropped soybeans to double-cropping soybeans with maize, and now produces 1.5% of the world's maize. This production shift required an increase in N fertilization, but the effects on N2O emissions are poorly known. We calibrated the process-oriented biogeochemical DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model to simulate N2O emissions and crop production from soybean and soybean-maize cropping systems in MT. After model validation with field measurements and adjustments for hydrological properties of tropical soils, regional simulations suggested N2O emissions from soybean-maize cropland increased almost fourfold during 2001-2010, from 1.1 +/- 1.1 to 4.1 +/- 3.2 Gg 1014 N-N2O. Model sensitivity tests showed that emissions were spatially and seasonably variable and especially sensitive to soil bulk density and carbon content. Meeting future demand for maize using current soybean area in MT might require either (a) intensifying 3.0 million ha of existing single soybean to soybean-maize or (b) increasing N fertilization to ~180 kg N ha(-1) on existing 2.3 million ha of soybean-maize area. The latter strategy would release ~35% more N2O than the first. Our modifications of the DNDC model will improve estimates of N2O emissions from agricultural production in MT and other tropical areas, but narrowing model uncertainty will depend on more detailed field measurements and spatial data on soil and cropping management.

A conceptual model explaining spatial variation in soil nitrous oxide emissions in agricultural fields. Soil emissions of nitrous oxide contribute substantially to global warming from agriculture. Spatiotemporal variation in nitrous oxide emissions within agricultural fields leads to uncertainty in the benefits of climate-smart agricultural practices. Here, we present a conceptual model explaining spatial variation in temporal patterns of soil nitrous oxide emissions developed from high spatial resolution measurements of soil nitrous oxide emissions, gross nitrous oxide fluxes, and soil physicochemical properties in two maize fields in Illinois, USA. In sub-field locations with consistently low nitrous oxide emissions, soil nitrate and dissolved organic carbon constrained nitrous oxide production irrespective of changes in soil moisture. In sub-field locations where high emissions occurred episodically, soil nitrate and dissolved organic carbon availability were higher, and increases in soil moisture stimulated nitrous oxide production. These findings form the 'cannon model' which conceptualizes how sub-field scale variation in soil nitrate and dissolved organic carbon determines where increases in soil moisture can trigger high soil nitrous oxide emissions within agricultural fields. Only in areas of agricultural fields where nitrate and dissolved organic carbon availability were high could soil moisture stimulate high nitrous oxide emissions, according to a conceptual model based on spatial measurements of emissions and soil properties.

Particulate organic matter predicts spatial variation in denitrification potential at the field scale. High spatiotemporal variability in soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes challenges quantification and prediction of emissions to evaluate the climate change mitigation outcomes of sustainable agricultural practices. Triggers for large, short-lived N2O emission pulses, such as rainfall and fertilization, alter soil oxygen (O-2) and nitrate (NO3-) availability to favor N2O production via denitrification. However, the organic C (OC) needed to fuel denitrification may exhibit subfield variation that constrains the potential for high denitrification rates to occur, leading to spatial variation in N2O hot moments. We tested the hypothesis that the particulate organic matter (POM) fraction of soil organic matter (SOM) controls subfield variation in denitrification potential by regulating availability of dissolved organic C (DOC), the form of OC used by denitrifiers. Among 38 soil samples collected across a maize field in central Illinois, USA, we found that potential denitrification rate was best predicted by POM C concentration (R-2 = 0.35). Using multiple linear regression analysis that included other soil properties as explanatory variables, we found that POM C fraction of bulk soil (mg POM C/g SOC) was the most important predictor based on regression coefficient size (P < 0.01). Our results, which provide support for our hypothesis, suggest that consideration of the link between C and N cycling may be a key to predicting spatiotemporal variation in soil N2O emissions when denitrification is the dominant N2O source process.

Direct nitrous oxide emissions from a crop rotation of maize and mung bean after different long-term fertilizer applications in Thailand. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas primarily released by fertilizers used in crop cultivation. In Thailand, cropland occupies the majority of the arable land but studies on N2O emissions from cropland remain scarce. The present study aimed to evaluate the N2O emissions, soil characteristics, and crop productivity resulting from different long-term fertilizer applications in a crop rotation of maize and mung bean. A long-term experimental field managed through crop residue incorporation combined with different fertilizer applications over 45 years was utilized in this study. It consisted of four distinct treatments: no fertilizer (CON), 134 kg N ha(-1) from organic fertilizer (ORG), 188 kg N ha(-1) from chemical fertilizer (CHE), and 322 kg N ha(-1) from a combination of organic and chemical fertilizers (OAC). Long-term application of chemical fertilizer induced soil acidification, whereas the use of organic fertilizer maintained soil pH and enhanced soil carbon accumulation. Results showed that the OAC, CHE, and ORG practices significantly (p < 0.05) increased direct N2O emissions from the soil, particularly during the maize cultivation period. Annual cumulative N2O emissions were enhanced on average by 204 % (3.22 kg N2O ha(-1)) in OAC, (1)81 % (2.98 kg N2O ha(-1)) in CHE, and 79.4 % (1.90 kg N2O ha(-1)) in ORG compared with CON (1.06 kg N2O ha(-1)), indicating that larger N input rates induced larger N2O emissions. Chemical fertilizer induced significantly (p < 0.05) larger and faster N2O emissions than organic fertilizer. When considering N2O emissions per N application rate in all treatments as the emission factor, the use of N fertilizers combined with crop residues in the soil over two years averaged 0.61 % (+/- 0.13 %). This value was approximately 39 % lower than the default value recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is currently used in Thailand. The consecutive addition of fertilizers significantly (p < 0.05) increased maize grain yield compared with the CON. However, no significant differences were observed among the various fertilizer treatments. Despite all fertilizer applications induced larger N2O emissions, they also produced greater crop yields. Consequently, this study recommended the practice of ORG as a means to mitigate emissions without compromising crop yield and soil quality.

Effect of Alternating Furrow Irrigation and Nitrogen Fertilizer on Nitrous Oxide Emission in Corn Field. The objectives of this 2-year field study were to assess the effects of irrigation and nitrogen (N) application on nitrous oxide (N2O). Soil N2O flux was determined using open-bottomed chambers. Nitrous oxide concentrations were determined with gas chromatography. The results showed that in 2008, N2O emission rates ranged from 2.0 to 50.0 g N ha(-1) d(-1) in the alternating furrow irrigation and N application treatments (AFINA) and from 2.4 to 68.4 g N ha(-1) d(-1) in the conventional every-furrow irrigation and fertilization treatment (CIF). In 2009, cumulative N2O-N loss in the optimal combination with greater yields and lower N2O emission in AFINA was 1277 g N ha(-1) compared to 1695 g N ha(-1) with CIF. The study indicated that AFINA practices combined with optimum N fertilizer and irrigation rates could reduce soil N2O emission and water input compared to CIF practices without causing a decline in corn yield.

Nitrous oxide emissions in a winter wheat - summer maize double cropping system under different tillage and fertilizer management. An accurate estimation of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from 110 million ha of upland in China is essential for the adoption of effective mitigation strategies. In this study, the effects of different tillage practices combined with nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications on N2O emission in soils were considered for a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - summer maize (Zea mays L.) double cropping system. Treatments included conventional tillage plus urea in split application (CTF1), conventional tillage with urea in a single application (CTF2), no-tillage with straw retained plus reduced urea in a split application (NTSF1) and no-tillage with manure plus reduced urea in a split application (NTMF1). The amounts of N input in each treatment were 285 and 225kg N/ha for wheat and maize, respectively. Both NTSF1 and NTMF1 were found to reduce chemical N fertilizer rates by 33.3% (wheat) and 20% (maize), respectively, compared to CTF1 and CTF2. N2O emissions varied between 3.2 (NTSF1) and 9.9 (CTF2) kg N2O-N/ha during the wheat season and between 7.6 (NTFS1) and 14.0 (NTMF1) kg N2O-N/ha during the maize season. The yield-based emission factors ranged from 21.9 (NTSF1) to 60.9 (CTF2) g N2O-N/kgN for wheat and 92.5 (NTSF1) to 157.4 (NTMF1) g N2O-N/kgN for maize. No significant effect of the treatments on crop yield was found. In addition to reducing production costs involved in land preparation, NTSF1 was shown to decrease chemical fertilizer input and mitigate N2O emissions while sustaining crop yield.

Cover Crop Effects on Nitrous Oxide Emissions: Role of Mineralizable Carbon. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from denitrification in agricultural soils often increases with N fertilizer and soil nitrate (NO3) concentrations. Overwintering cover crops in cereal rotations can decrease soil NO3 concentrations and may decrease N2O emissions. However, mineralizable C availability can be a more important control on N2O emission than NO3 concentration in fertilized soils, and cover crop residue provides mineralizable C input. We measured the effect of a winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop on soil N2O emissions from a maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system treated with banded N fertilizer at three rates (0, 135, and 225 kg N ha(-1)) in Iowa. In addition, we conducted laboratory incubations to determine if potential N2O emissions were limited by mineralizable C or NO3 at these N rates. The rye cover crop decreased soil NO3 concentrations at all N rates. Although the cover crop decreased N2O emissions when no N fertilizer was applied, it increased N2O emissions at an N rate near the economic optimum. In laboratory incubations, N2O emissions from soils from fertilizer bands did not increase with added NO3, but did increase with added glucose. These results show that mineralizable C availability can control N2O emissions, indicating that C from cover crop residue increased N2O emissions from fertilizer band soils in the field. Mineralizable C availability should be considered in future evaluations of cover crop effects on N2O emissions, especially as cover crops are evaluated as a strategy to mitigate agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

Soil N2O emissions under conventional and reduced tillage methods and maize cultivation. The study concerned the determination of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under conventional and reduced tillage conditions. In the reduced cultivation, a soil cultivating seed drill was used for simultaneous sowing of seeds and subsurface application of fertilizer. The emission levels of the gas tested were dependent on the year of the study and the method of soil tillage, and were subject to considerable changes during the growing season. The use of reduced soil tillage significantly limited emissions of the analysed gas into the atmosphere. Depending on the year of the study, N2O emission in the reduced tillage system was from 15% to 40% lower than in the conventional system. Low levels of easily mineralized components in soil could have been the cause of the reduction in N2O emissions to the atmosphere.

The utility of a boundary line approach for simulating denitrification and nitrous oxide emissions from a Regosol under summer maize-winter wheat crop rotation in Southwest China. Despite the ever-increasing measurements of denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions globally, boundary line analyses of these important processes have only been applied to a limited number of agroecosystems. The primary aims of this study were to determine the responses of denitrification and N2O emissions from a subtropical cropland to several soil parameters through boundary line analyses, and to evaluate the ability of site-specific boundary line models for simulating gaseous nitrogen (N) losses using available soil parameters. We performed 403 measurements of denitrification and N2O emissions from two fields cropped with a winter wheat-summer maize rotation in the Sichuan Basin, Southwest China, from October 2004 to September 2005. Boundary lines were fitted for denitrification and N2O emission data against soil temperature, water content, ammonium and/or nitrate substrates, and heterotrophic respiration rates. The boundary lines were largely in agreement with existing theoretical concepts. By incorporating the regulatory effects of soil temperature, water content, N substrates, and an unknown factor that could be related to ammoniumcontent, the boundary linemodels reasonably simulated the seasonal variations in denitrification and N2O emissions thatwere collected froma field trial in the same region during the maize season in 2012. The models overestimated the denitrification and N2O emissions on the sampling dates by 8% and 22% on average, respectively. We conclude that boundary linemodels are useful tools for estimating gaseous N losses from a given cropland. However, the application of the models is limited by the availability of input data.

Climate proofing maize through optimizing manure fertilization. Optimizing nitrogen fertilizers use can improve maize yields, soil fertility, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions, but it remains uncertain as to what impact it will continue to have in the context of ongoing climatic changes. In this research, we use long-term field experimental data and the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model to evaluate the impact of combining manure with chemical fertilizers on spring maize yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Using four future climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) based on Global Climate Models (GCMs), the APSIM model showed climate change will reduce the maize yield and SOC content compared to the preceding decade. Increasing manure use could mitigate the decrease in maize yield and SOC content under future climate scenarios in contrast to current practices, however, this would in all climate scenarios promote nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Evaluating crop productivity, soil health, environmental impact, and economic considerations, this study recommends replacing 50 % of the nitrogen in farmers' conventional chemical fertilization practices with manure (RFP0.5) as the optimal approach. This approach is a perfect balance which effectively mitigates maize yields and SOC loss in response to future climate change, while also addressing greenhouse gas emissions.

Nitrogen stabilizers mitigate nitrous oxide emissions across maize production areas of China: A multi-agroecosystems evaluation. N stabilizers such as urease and nitrification inhibitors are potential tools for mitigating N2O emissions and improving maize yield. However, the efficacy of N stabilizers is inconsistent across a broad range of agro-ecosystems. To enable the large-scale use of N stabilizers for sustainable agricultural development, it is necessary to identify the benefits of N stabilizers and the driving factors that regulate their efficiency. Here, we evaluated the efficiencies of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) and N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) in four typical ecological sites with contrasting climatic and soil conditions in the maize production area of China (Gongzhuling, Wuqiao, Xinxiang, and Wenzhou). Disparate ecological sites significantly influenced the N2O emissions (0.2-19.0 kg N2O-N ha -1) and maize yields (7.5-13.9 Mt ha -1). Also, N stabilizers reduced N2O emissions by 1.3-93.9 % across the four sites. Compared to NBPT, DMPP showed higher efficiency, but the joint inhibitor (NBPT+DMPP) had non-significant effects compared to DMPP. Although N stabilizers did not signifi-cantly increase maize yield, they reduced yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSNEs) by 3.1-83.4 % (p < 0.05) across study sites. Hotspots of N2O emission occurred within two weeks after N fertilization, and the mitigation of N stabilizers on N2O emissions was strongly reduced over time. This implies the degradation velocity of N stabi-lizers was critical for emissions mitigation efficiency. Meanwhile, environmental factors obviously influenced N stabilizers efficiency. Random forest and correlation analyses indicated that soil pH and sand content showed positive correlations and high importance for the N2O mitigation efficiencies of N stabilizers, whereas water -filled pore space and salt content showed negative correlations and high importance. In addition, N2O mitiga-tion efficiencies of different N stabilizers showed a different response to environmental changes, wherein higher environmental sensitivity and easy invalidation under unsuitable conditions were observed in NBPT than in DMPP. In conclusion, DMPP effectively mitigated YSNEs in all study sites, and its efficiency was closely regulated by soil pH, water-filled pore space, and soil texture. Therefore, amending soil quality may enhance the benefits of DMPP and might decrease future N2O emissions in the maize fields of China.

Effects of maize residue return rate on nitrogen transformations and gaseous losses in an arable soil. Residue return in combination with synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer is increasingly being considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield. In most studies, however, attention has mainly been paid to the way that significant changes in the soil N mineralization process affect the soil N cycle, while the effect of different residue return amounts on ammonia (NH3) volatilization and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, potentially the most important components of N losses and environmental effects has, to a certain extent, been neglected, notably in north-eastern China. Therefore, a trial was set up in an Alfisol/arable soil during 2015-2016 to monitor annual NH3 volatilization and N2O emission dynamics from a fertilized maize field with residue return at different rates. Treatments included N fertilizer alone and N fertilizer in combination with either half or the full yield of the maize residue (5.8 x 10(3) or 11.6 x 10(3) kg ha(-1), respectively) returned to the soil surface after harvest. Over a growing season of maize, the NH3 volatilization loss rate from the full residue return treatment was 4.6%, which was significantly lower than that in the N fertilizer application only and half residue return plots (6.1%). Meanwhile, residue return rates showed a significant effect on annual N2O emissions from the maize system. Half residue return increased N2O emission (921.1 g N.ha(-1)), while full residue return marginally decreased N2O emissions (862.6 g N.ha(-1)) during the maize growing season, compared to the fertilizer-only treatment (881.2 g N.ha(-1)) (P < 0.05). In spite of the fact that N2O emissions in the non-growing season increased with the quantity of maize residue applied, the return of the full yield of maize residue to the soil could reduce both annual NH3 and annual N2O losses and increase soil total N and C storage after long-term use. It is suggested that residue application rate is a key factor when assessing residue benefits but the influence is in a nonlinear pattern. The combined application of full maize residue and synthetic N fertilizer is a promising N management strategy for mitigating gaseous N emissions.

Nitrous oxide emissions and maize yield as influenced by nitrogen fertilization and tillage operations in upland soil. Previous studies simply focused on determining nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the soil under different tillage operations and nitrogen (N) fertilizations without considering crop yield. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of different tillage operations and N fertilizations on N2O emissions and crop yield from upland soil. Two different tillage operations [conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT)] and N fertilizations [without urea (WOU) and with 186 kg N ha(-1) of urea (WU)] were established in a randomized block design with three replications on upland soil. Maize (Zea mays) was cultivated from 6th July to 4th October, 2018 (year 1), and from 15th April to 26th July, 2019 (year 2). The daily N2O flux did not peak soon after tillage operation and N fertilization, but it was more related to the change in water-filled pore space (WFPS). The mean value of WFPS across N fertilizations and seasons (years) was higher in CT than in NT. The changes of nitrification and denitrification rates could be attributed to the differences in WFPS between CT and NT. Nitrification was the predominant process producing N2O with CT, but denitrification was with NT. The application of urea increased cumulative N2O emissions, while CT also increased it compared with NT. The order of the mean values of cumulative N2O emissions across seasons from the highest to the lowest was as follows: CT + WU (7.12 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1)) > NT + WU (5.69 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1)) >= CT + WOU (5.02 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1)) > NT + WOU (4.24 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1)). Tillage operation did not affect the grain yield of maize or yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSNE). However, the application of urea increased the grain yield of maize and decreased YSNE, implying it could reduce N2O emission per unit of maize grain production. No-tillage management did not decrease YSNE value compared to CT operation, but N fertilization significantly decreased YSNE in the current study.

Effect of tropical grass and nitrogen fertilization on nitrous oxide, methane, and ammonia emissions of maize-based rotation systems. While tropical grasses were shown to inhibit the activity of soil nitrifiers, their role in greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia (NH3) emissions in N fertilized maize-based rotations are poorly understood. A 3-year (2014-2017) field experiment was conducted in southeastern Brazil to assess the influence of forage grass and N fertilization on nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and NH3 emissions from maize (Zea mays L.)-grass rotations. Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv. Tanzania), palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu), and ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis cv. Comum) were grown in the main plots, while an unfertilized control and 140 kg N ha(-1) were applied annually to maize in sub-plots. No apparent nitrification suppression by the grasses was detected. N2O fluxes increased following N fertilizer addition in maize, particularly in the second season, where slightly higher cumulative N2O emission was observed with N fertilization in comparison with the control. CH4 fluxes showed high variation in the first forage and maize growing seasons. Residual N fertilizer decreased soil CH4 uptake of palisade grass and ruzigrass compared with unfertilized palisade grass in the second forage season. Cumulative NH3 emissions were unaffected by forage species and N fertilization. However, in both maize seasons, yield-scaled NH3 emission was the lowest following N addition. Throughout the seasons, the differences between the three grasses in N2O, CH4, and NH3 emissions were minimal. We conclude that the tropical perennial grasses rotated with maize were similar regarding GHG and NH3 emissions, while N fertilization slightly increased N2O emission and decreased soil CH4 uptake.

The nitrification inhibitors (NIs) effects on soil nitrogen (N) fates and maize yields were investigated in a loamy-sand soil in Thailand. The treatments were chemical fertilizer (CF) and CF with dicyandiamide (DCD) or neem oil at two rates of 5% and 10%. Compared to the CF plot, DCD and neem oil reduced the cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) emission by the equivalent of 26% and 10%, respectively (P < 0.05). DCD and neem oil had a positive effect in slowing ammonium (NH4+)-conversion and prolonging NH4+-N in the soil with a maximum efficiency of 45% and 30%, respectively. NO3-N was higher in the NI plots (P < 0.05), but the effect was less pronounced later in the growing season. Adding the NIs increased maize yields and N uptake, but was only significant (P < 0.10) for neem oil. Results indicate that applying NIs is an effective method to mitigate soil N losses and enhancing N use efficiency in a tropical, agricultural field.

Assessing nitrous oxide emissions and productivity of cropping systems for biogas production using digestate and mineral fertilisation in a coastal marsh site. Significant greenhouse gas emissions during substrate cultivation reduces the potential environmental benefits of biogas production. This study investigates the productivity of different cropping systems and their environmental impact in terms of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under the environmental conditions of the coastal marsh regions (Northern Germany) with heavy clay soils, in a 2-year field trial (April 2009-March 2011). Treatments included four cropping systems (perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne, PR) ley, continuous maize (Zea mays), a rotation (CR1) of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum, IR) and maize, and a rotation (CR2) of maize, winter wheat and IR; two sources of N (nitrogen) fertilizers (calcium ammonium nitrate, and biogas residue (BR)), and three levels of N fertilizer applications (control, moderate, high). Nitrous oxide emissions were determined for the unfertilized and highly fertilized cropping systems comprising PR ley, CR1 and CR2. Cumulative annual N2O emissions varied across the treatments, ranging from 0.82 to 3.4 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1). Under high N fertilizer applications, PR ley incurred higher N2O-N losses compared to other tested cropping systems, and IR cover crop caused relatively high N2O-N emissions in a short vegetation period. The study observed wide range of yield-scaled emissions (0.00-5.60 kg N2O-N (Mg DM)(-1)) for different crops, emphasizing the variability in N2O emissions linked to cropping systems. The N2O-N emission factors for the three cropping systems were found to be low to moderate for all treatments, ranging from 0.03% to 0.53% compared to IPCC default Tier 1 N2O-N EFs. The lower emissions in the study were associated with prolonged high soil moisture conditions (water filled pore space >70%.), indicated by its negative correlation with N2O-N fluxes. Low dry matter and N yield of PR and of the wheat-IR sequence after BR application compared to other crops indicated a low N use efficiency. The estimation of N2O-N emissions based on N surplus was not promising specifically for the coastal study site where high groundwater level and organic matter in the soils were the predominant drivers for N2O-N emissions.

Effect of topography on nitrous oxide emissions from winter wheat fields in Central France. We assessed nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions at shoulder and foot-slope positions along three sloping sites (1.6-2.1%) to identify the factors controlling the spatial variations in emissions. The three sites received same amounts of total nitrogen (N) input at 170 kg N ha(-1). Results showed that landscape positions had a significant, but not consistent effect on N2O fluxes with larger emission in the foot-slope at only one of the three sites. The effect of soil inorganic N (NH4+ NO3-) contents on N2O fluxes (r(2) = 0.55, p < 0.001) was influenced by water-filled pore space (WFPS). Soil N2O fluxes were related to inorganic N at WFPS > 60% (r(2) = 0.81, p < 0.001), and NH4+ contents at WFPS < 60% (r(2) = 0.40, p < 0.01), respectively. Differences in WFPS between shoulder and foot-slope correlated linearly with differences in N2O fluxes (r(2) = 0.45, p < 0.001). We conclude that spatial variations in N2O emission were regulated by the influence of hydrological processes on soil aeration intensity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Feasibility of stabilised nitrogen fertilisers decreasing greenhouse gas emissions under optimal management in sprinkler irrigated conditions. Stabilised nitrogen (N) fertilisers with nitrification and urease inhibitors have been proposed to abate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agrosystems. Nevertheless, differences in their application and in the management of water and nitrogen rates make it difficult to evaluate their actual utility. The aim of this study was to analyse the possibility for GHG emissions reduction in a 3-year rotation (maize-maize-wheat) by substituting the traditional split-urea application to maize by a single side-dress application of stabilised urea fertiliser. The experiment was performed in 24 drainage lysimeters in two contrasting soil types (Shallow and Deep) under efficient irrigation practices and adjusted N rates under Mediterranean conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were measured using static closed unvented chambers, and the soil mineral N was monitored through periodic soil samplings. CH4 emissions were generally negligible with occasional tendency the soil acting as a sink more than as a net source. Direct N2O emissions during the whole rotation showed lower values when a nitrification inhibitor (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate) was added than with conventional urea (Deep soil: 73% lower, p < 0.05; Shallow soil: 60% lower, ns). Urease inhibitors (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide and monocarbamide dihydrogen sulphate) could not abate direct N2O emissions, and their effect depended on the soil type. However, all stabilised fertilisers mitigated N2O emissions in Deep soil when scaled by grain yield (average 54%). Indirect N2O emissions associated with nitrate leaching were not affected by the treatments but contributed more to total N2O emissions in Shallow soil (12%) than in Deep soil (6%). These results suggest that adequate use of nitrification inhibitors could have environmental benefits without lessening agronomic production.

The impact of long-term organic farming on soil-derived greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural practices contribute considerably to emissions of greenhouse gases. So far, knowledge on the impact of organic compared to non-organic farming on soil-derived nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions is limited. We investigated N2O and CH4 fluxes with manual chambers during 571 days in a grass-clover-silage maize - green manure cropping sequence in the long-term field trial \"DOK\" in Switzerland. We compared two organic farming systems - biodynamic (BIODYN) and bioorganic (BIOORG) - with two non-organic systems - solely mineral fertilisation (CONMIN) and mixed farming including farmyard manure (CONFYM) - all reflecting Swiss farming practices-together with an unfertilised control (NOFERT). We observed a 40.2% reduction of N2O emissions per hectare for organic compared to non-organic systems. In contrast to current knowledge, yield-scaled cumulated N2O emissions under silage maize were similar between organic and non-organic systems. Cumulated on area scale we recorded under silage maize a modest CH4 uptake for BIODYN and CONMIN and high CH4 emissions for CONFYM. We found that, in addition to N input, quality properties such as pH, soil organic carbon and microbial biomass significantly affected N2O emissions. This study showed that organic farming systems can be a viable measure contributing to greenhouse gas mitigation in the agricultural sector.

Liebig's law of the minimum applied to a greenhouse gas: alleviation of P-limitation reduces soil N2O emission. Emission of the greenhouse gas (GHG) nitrous oxide (N2O) are strongly affected by nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rates. However, the role of other nutrients through stoichiometric relations with N has hardly been studied. We tested whether phosphorus (P) availability affects N2O emission. We hypothesized that alleviation of plant P-limitation reduces N2O emission through lowering soil mineral N concentrations. We tested our hypothesis in a pot experiment with maize (Zea mays L.) growing on a P-limiting soil/sand mixture. Treatment factors included P and N fertilization and inoculation with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF; which can increase P uptake). Both N and P fertilization, as well as their interaction significantly (P < 0.01) affected N2O emission. Highest N2O emissions (2.38 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) were measured at highest N application rates without P fertilization or AMF. At the highest N application rate, N2O fluxes were lowest (0.71 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) with both P fertilization and AMF. The N2O emission factors decreased with 50 % when P fertilization was applied. Our results illustrate the importance of the judicious use of all nutrients to minimize N2O emission, and thereby further underline the intimate link between sound agronomic practice and prudent soil GHG management.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL SOIL ATTRIBUTES OF OFF-SEASON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN THE SAVANNAH OF MARANHAO STATE, BRAZIL. Management of agricultural production systems interferes with greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, thereby altering physical, chemical, and biological attributes of soil; therefore, it is important to understand the relationship between soil attributes and GHG emissions. This study evaluated GHG emissions and their relationship with soil attributes in offseason soybean, maize, brachiaria and eucalyptus production systems. The experiment was carried out in Brejo, Maranhao, Brazil, with soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays), brachiaria (Urochloa ruzizienses), and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis). Fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were evaluated using air samples analyzed by gas chromatography. Soil attributes were ammonium and nitrate contents, total organic carbon, moisture, pH, density, total porosity, and water-filled pore space. N2O flux was 287.1 & mu;g m-2 h -1 for eucalyptus cultivation, while areas cultivated with soybeans, maize and brachiaria had influxes of 46.7, 7.2, and 13.17 & mu;g m-2 h-1, respectively. In the off-season, the highest emissions of N2O and CO2 were measured in eucalyptus areas due to soil moisture and porosity conditions provided by accumulation of litter on the soil surface.

Nitrous oxide emissions from maize following grass-clover: Treatment of plant cover and manure with 3,4-dipyrazol phosphate (DMPP) as mitigation strategy. Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with nitrous oxide (N2O) playing a critical role. In dairy farming, grass-clover (GC) is widely used in crop rotations and often preceding maize, but the period between GC incorporation and maize N uptake has a high risk for environmental losses, including N2O emissions. This study investigated if a nitrification inhibitor, DMPP, can reduce spring N2O emissions from maize after GC on sandy soil with or without cattle slurry (CS) as supplementary N. The inhibitor was applied to GC before incorporation, together with CS, or both. Emissions of N2O and concentrations of N2O at 5, 10, 20 and 30 cm depth were monitored during spring in two years. The highest cumulative emissions were observed in the unamended GC+CS treatment (5.1 and 4.2 kg N ha(-)(1) in 2022 and 2023, respectively). N2O emissions often occurred at < 60 % WFPS, showing that GC residues and liquid manure created anaerobic conditions sustaining emissions. DMPP application to GC did not significantly reduce N2O emissions, possibly due to NO3- derived from roots. Also, N2O accumulation at 20-30 cm was enhanced by CS despite injection to 8 cm depth, suggesting downward transport of NO3-. When applied with cattle slurry, DMPP effectively reduced emissions by an average 71 %, with some treatments even exhibiting net negative emissions. These findings highlight the complexity of soil N dynamics after termination of GC pastures and the importance of management strategies to mitigate this source of N2O emissions in dairy farming systems.

Biochar and short-term N2O and CO2 emission from plant residue-amended soil with different fertilisation history. The effect of biochar application on nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from an arable soil amended with maize leaves was studied in a laboratory experiment using soil samples collected from plots with three different fertiliser treatments: no fertilisation (CONT), mineral fertiliser (NPKMg) and farmyard manure (FYM), of a well characterized agricultural experiment established in 1949. Two biochars (BC) used in the experiment were produced in low temperature slow (BCslow) and in high temperature fast (BCfast) pyrolysis, and applied at a rate of 10 t ha(-1). Different fertilisation strategies induced significant differences in the soil total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents (CONT < NPKMg < FYM), but at the time of the soil sample collection the soil contained low levels of plant-available nitrogen (<10 mg kg(-1) N soil) independent of the fertilisation treatment. A stable suppressive effect of BCslow but not BCfast application on N2O emissions was found for maize leaves-amended soil. The short-term effect of residue application on N2O emission was much stronger than the 60-year difference in the soil fertilisation strategy. Mixing of biochar with maize leaves and the soil was in general more efficient in reducing N2O emissions than biochar application in layers. Neither of the studied ways of biochar application to the soils systematically reduced CO2 emissions.

Nitrous oxide emissions from an annual crop rotation on poorly drained soil on the Canadian Prairies. Agricultural soils are a significant anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. Despite likely having large emissions of N2O, there are no continuous multi-year studies of emissions from poorly drained floodplain soil. In the present study, the micrometeorological flux of N2O (E-N) was measured over three years (2006-2008) in a maize (Zea mays L.)/faba (Vicia faba minor L.)/spring-wheat (Triticum aestivum L) rotation in the Red River Valley, Manitoba, Canada on a gleyed humic verticol soil. Comparison of newly established reduced and intensive tillage treatments showed no difference in F-N within the constraints of the high variability between duplicate plots. The annual gap-filled Sigma F-N across tillage treatments was 5.5, 1.4, and 4.3 kg N ha(-1) in the maize, faba, and spring-wheat crop years, respectively. Emissions from fertilizer N addition and soil thaw the following spring was responsible for the greater Sigma F-N in the maize and spring-wheat years. Using four approaches to approximate background Sigma F-N resulted in estimates of 3.5-3.8% and 1.4-1.8% of applied fertilizer N emitted as N2O for the maize and spring-wheat crops, respectively. The CO2 global warming potential equivalent of Sigma F-N over the three study years was an emission of 5.4 Mg CO2-equiv. ha(-1) which adds to the previously determined C balance emission of 11.6 Mg CO2-equiv. ha(-1).

Factors That Influence Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Agricultural Soils as Well as Their Representation in Simulation Models: A Review. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a long-lived greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Emissions of N2O mainly stem from agricultural soils. This review highlights the principal factors from peer-reviewed literature affecting N2O emissions from agricultural soils, by grouping the factors into three categories: environmental, management and measurement. Within these categories, each impact factor is explained in detail and its influence on N2O emissions from the soil is summarized. It is also shown how each impact factor influences other impact factors. Process-based simulation models used for estimating N2O emissions are reviewed regarding their ability to consider the impact factors in simulating N2O. The model strengths and weaknesses in simulating N2O emissions from managed soils are summarized. Finally, three selected process-based simulation models (Daily Century (DAYCENT), DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)) are discussed that are widely used to simulate N2O emissions from cropping systems. Their ability to simulate N2O emissions is evaluated by describing the model components that are relevant to N2O processes and their representation in the model.

The Nitrification Inhibitor Vizura® Reduces N2O Emissions When Added to Digestate before Injection under Irrigated Maize in the Po Valley (Northern Italy). The agricultural area in the Po Valley is prone to high nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions as it is characterized by irrigated maize-based cropping systems, high amounts of nitrogen supplied, and elevated air temperature in summer. Here, two monitoring campaigns were carried out in maize fertilized with raw digestate in a randomized block design in 2016 and 2017 to test the effectiveness of the 3, 4 DMPP inhibitor Vizura (R) on reducing N2O-N emissions. Digestate was injected into 0.15 m soil depth at side-dressing (2016) and before sowing (2017). Non-steady state chambers were used to collect N2O-N air samples under zero N fertilization (N0), digestate (D), and digestate + Vizura (R) (V). Overall, emissions were significantly higher in the D treatment than in the V treatment in both 2016 and 2017. The emission factor (EF, %) of V was two and four times lower than the EF in D in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Peaks of NO3-N generally resulted in N2O-N emissions peaks, especially during rainfall or irrigation events. The water-filled pore space (WFPS, %) did not differ between treatments and was generally below 60%, suggesting that N2O-N emissions were mainly due to nitrification rather than denitrification.

Functional N-cycle genes in soil and N2O emissions in tropical grass-maize intercropping systems. There is evidence that forage grasses such as Megathyrsus and Urochloa can suppress nitrification, with direct or indirect consequences on soil inorganic N dynamics and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the influence of soil chemical properties on the dynamics of functional N-genes and losses of N in maize (Zea mays L.) inter cropped with forage grasses under N fertilization is poorly understood. In this study, soil samples and N2O emissions were analyzed from a field experiment in which maize (fertilized or not with ammonium-based fertilizer) was intercropped with Guinea grass (M. maximus cv. Tanzania), palisade grass (U. brizantha cv. Marandu), and ruzigrass (U. ruziziensis cv. Comum). Soil N-cycle microorganisms [16S rRNA of bacteria and archaea, nifH (gene encoding N2-fixing bacteria), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), nirS (encoding nitrite reductase), and nosZ (encoding nitrous oxide reductase)] were influenced by forage grass, N fertilization, and sampling time, but no evidence of biological nitrification inhibition was found. Palisade grass was associated with a higher abundance of nifH (7.0 x 105 gene copies g-1 soil, on average) in the absence of N compared with the other grasses (4.3 x 105 gene copies g-1 soil, on average). Nitrogen fertilization increased the abundance of AOB but not AOA. Furthermore, N2O flux was influenced by AOB, water-filled pore space, and N fertilization, whereas the cumulative N2O emission and fertilizer-induced emission factor (0.36%, on average) were not affected by the grasses. In conclusion, this study reveals the strong dominance of AOB under ammonium supply, potentially stimulating N2O emissions in maize-forage grass intercropping systems.

Inhibiting N2O emissions and improving environmental benefits by integrating garlic growing in grain production systems. The grain-economic cropping system combines grain production with economic benefits. Under this system, decreasing the N2O emissions from farmland soil will be more conducive to the development of green agriculture. Therefore, we determined the soil N2O emissions and ecological benefits of garlic-maize and wheat-maize cropping systems from 2019 to 2020. Compared with wheat-maize, garlic-maize significantly decreased the soil urease activity and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) content, which significantly decreased the N2O emission fluxes by 44.6% and 36.4% in the crop growing seasons during 2019-2020, respectively, thereby indicating that planting garlic could effectively inhibit the soil N2O emissions. Moreover, garlic enhanced the ecological benefits of the planting system by 2.1 times as an economic crop. Path analysis showed that the soil temperature, waterfilled pore spaces, and DIN significantly promoted soil N2O emissions in the wheat-maize system but weakened them in the garlic-maize system. However, the urease activity significantly affected the DIN content, which indicates that garlic could significantly decrease DIN production by inhibiting the urease activity to reduce N2O emissions. Our findings demonstrate that garlic can be used as an environmentally friendly economic crop to optimize planting systems.

Large nitrous oxide emissions from arable soils after crop harvests prior to sowing. Global agriculture is the largest anthropogenic source for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. During crop rotations, periods with arable soils without crops, thereafter called \"bare soils\" are often impossible to avoid after the crop is harvested, prior to sowing of the next crop. However, such periods are underrepresented in studies focussing on N2O emissions. Here, we present continuous, high-temporal-resolution N2O fluxes during bare soil periods after four major crops, using the eddy-covariance technique at two sites in Switzerland. Overall, periods with bare soil were net sources for N2O as well as for carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Daily average sums of N2O emissions varied between 10 +/- 2 and 38 +/- 5 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) after the respective rapeseed, winter wheat, pea, and maize harvests. While CO2 emissions contributed 86-96% to the total GHG budgets, N2O fluxes accounted for 2% after pea, but for 10-12% after rapeseed, winter wheat, and maize. In contrast, CH4 fluxes were negligible (< 2%). N2O fluxes during bare soil periods increased for all cropland sites with increasing water-filled pore space, particularly at high soil temperatures. Thus, our study emphasizes the significance of avoiding bare soil periods to mitigate N2O emissions from croplands.

Influence of irrigation time and frequency on greenhouse gas emissions in a solid-set sprinkler-irrigated maize under Mediterranean conditions. Irrigation management may influence soil greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Solid-set sprinkler irrigation systems allow to modify the irrigation time and frequency. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of two irrigation times (daytime, D; nighttime, N) and two irrigation frequencies (low, L; high, H) on soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a solid-set sprinkler-irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) field located in NE Spain during 2015 and 2016 growing seasons and the fallow period between growing seasons. Compared with D irrigation, N irrigation increased soil water content (0-5 cm) in both growing seasons. Irrigation management did not affect CH4 emissions and the soil acted as a sink of CH4. Cumulative CO2 emissions were affected by the measurement period (growing season vs fallow) with the greatest values in 2015 growing season, being 81 and 32% higher over the fallow period and over the 2016 growing season, respectively, due to the effect of the preceding crop, alfalfa, and a better soil moisture conditions for the microorganism activity. Similarly, cumulative N2O emissions showed the highest values in 2015, reporting values 90 and 51% greater than the fallow period and the 2016 growing season, respectively. Moreover, N irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions by 29% compared with D irrigation, but irrigation frequency did not affect cumulative N2O emissions. Irrigation time did not affect cumulative N2O emissions scaled per grain yield or per N uptake because N irrigation increased maize yield by 11% compared with D irrigation. Due to the lack of differences in the scaled N2O emissions, N irrigation should be consider as an appropriate strategy to optimize grain yield without compromising soil GHG emissions per unit of grain yield in Mediterranean agroecosystems.

Pigeon pea biochar addition in tropical Arenosol under maize increases gross nitrification rate without an effect on nitrous oxide emission. Aims: To assess how biochar addition in rainfed conservation agriculture affects short-term transformation, plant uptake, retention of nitrogen (N) in soil, and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in a tropical Arenosol planted to maize. Methods: A ten-day in situ(15)N pool dilution and N cycling experiment, using tracer amounts (0.1 g m(-2)) of N-15 labeled ammonium ((NH4+)-N-15), nitrate ((NO3-)-N-15) or N-15-urea, was carried out seven weeks after planting of maize (Zea mays L.) under conservation agriculture in Zambia, using planting basins without (CA) and with pigeon-pea biochar (BC) addition (4 t ha(-1)). Results: Pigeon-pea biochar increased soil NO3- concentration, gross nitrification rate, N-15 recovery in extractable soil NO3-, and soil moisture. However, effects of biochar on soil N retention and plant N uptake were not significant. Likewise, biochar did not affect N2O fluxes. Conclusions: At low dosage, pigeon pea biochar has a positive effect on gross nitrification rate but does not affect short-term N retention in soil, N2O fluxes, nor does it help increasing the uptake of N by maize.

Waterlogging effects on N2O and N2 emissions from a Stagnosol cultivated with Silphium perfoliatum and silage maize. European policy recommends that biomass production occur on marginal land, such as poorly draining Stagnosols. Compared to annual cropping, perennial crops may better mitigate N2O emissions at such sites, through more complete denitrification. To test that hypothesis, we compared N-2 and N2O fluxes from the soils of a perennial crop (cup plant, Silphium perfoliatum L.) and an annual crop (silage maize, Zea mays L.). Intact soil columns (35 cm height, 14.4 cm diameter) were incubated for 37 days. The soils were fertilized with 60 or 120 kg N ha(-1) and exposed to successive phases of waterlogging: free drainage, waterlogging of 1/3-, and waterlogging of 2/3- of the column. Source-specific N2O and N-2 fluxes were measured using the (15) N gas flux method. Denitrification was higher in cup plant than maize soil and total N losses from denitrification were dominated by emissions from the third phase. Cup plant soil emitted 33.6 +/- 78.1 mg N m(-2) and 95.8 +/- 64.4 mg N m(-2) more N2O than maize soil in the low and high N treatments, respectively. The product ratio of denitrification (N(2)Oi = N2O/(N-2 + N2O)) increased with waterlogging in maize soil, while remaining stable in cup plant soil. Emissions from the top 10 cm dominated the N(2)Oi rather than N-2 fluxes from the saturated soil. This study did not show N2O mitigation in cup plant soil, instead highlighting the complexity of plant-soil effects on denitrification. We clearly showed that the application of a general N(2)Oi for agricultural soils across annual and perennial cropping is not recommended.

A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influences of long-term applications of organic amendments and chemical fertilizers on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from Mollisols in northeast China and to relate soil N2O fluxes to soil moisture and temperature. A closed-chamber method was used to determine soil N2O flux during the maize growing season in 2011. In the entire maize growing period, cumulative N2O emissions were significantly (all P < 0.05) increased by 66, 86 and 83% under the applications of 4.5 Mg ha(-1) maize straw combined with NPK, 7.5 and 22.5 Mg ha(-1) pig manure combined with NPK, respectively, compared with the control (0.64 +/- 0.01 kg N2O-N ha(-1)), whereas NPK fertilizer alone and 2.25 Mg ha(-1) maize straw combined with NPK had no remarkable influences (P > 0.05). Nonetheless, even increasing nitrogen inputs, the cumulative microbial N2O emission over 126 days had an upper threshold around 1.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Approximately 25-44% of N2O was emitted from the applied organic amendments, and the emission factor (EF) of applied organic amendments as N2O based on 126 days was between 0.07 and 1.52%, higher than NPK fertilizer-induced EF (0.03%). Soil temperature explained 38-96% of the seasonal variation in soil N2O fluxes using exponential models, with a Q(10) of 2.01-3.48. Our results suggest that the influences of organic amendments on soil N2O emissions from Mollisols primarily vary with the type of the applied organic amendments, whereas great nitrogen inputs at maximum asymptotically double baseline cumulative emissions.

Characterization of yield and cumulative nitrous oxide emission of maize varieties in responses to different nitrogen application rates. The nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of maize is usually below 60%. Considering future food supply and climate change, selective breeding of maize with high nitrogen (N)-efficient varieties, covering genetic diversities, is an effective strategy for identifying specific elements for controlling NUE and productivity per arable farming unit while reducing environmental damage. This study evaluated the yield and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission of 30 maize varieties under two different N doses of 57.5 kg N ha-1 (N1, N-sufficient) and 173 kg N ha-1 (N3, N-high) applied in two equal splits on 2 and 4 weeks after germination (WAG). Then, the tested maize varieties were categorized into four groups based on the grain yield and cumulative N2O, that is, efficientefficient (EE) under both N1 and N3, high-N efficient (HNE) under N3 only, low-N efficient (LNE) under N1 only, and nonefficient-nonefficient (NN) under neither N1 nor N3. Maize yield was significantly positively correlated with shoot biomass, N-accumulation, and kernel-number under N1 and with N2O-flux at 5 WAG, NH4+, shoot biomass, and all of yield components under N3, whereas cumulative N2O showed a significant positive correlation with NO3- under N3 only and with N2O flux at 3 WAG under both N levels. The EE generally showed higher grain yield, yield components, N-accumulation, dry matter accumulation, root volume, and NH4+ in soil and lower cumulative N2O and NO3- in soil relative to NN maize varieties. The EE variety groups of maize can be a feasible strategy for increasing N fertilizer efficiency without reducing maize production as well as decrease the negative impact of N lost in agricultural system.

Long-term fertilization on nitrogen use efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions in a double maize cropping system in subtropical China. Fertilizer application often significantly affects soil quality and crop productivity, thus, can affect soil green-house gas (GHG) emissions and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) as well. However, the impacts have not been well documented under double maize cropping system in subtropical China. Based on a thirty-year field experiment with five fertilization treatments (i.e. no fertilizer (CK), organic manure (OM), N, NPK and NPK plus OM (NPKM)), maize cultivar (Yedan 13) was planted both at the early maize season and late maize season, we assessed the impacts of different fertilizer application on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions, grain yield and NUE. Compared to the NPK, manure application (i.e. OM and NPKM) significantly increased N2O emissions, and maize yield. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in yield-scaled global warming potential (GWP) among NPK, OM, and NPKM. Manure application increased soil pH, soil organic carbon, and soil total N, suggesting it can improve soil quality. The NPKM treatment had the highest N uptake, but in terms of NUE, it was lower than OM, due to double N application. Our results suggest that manure application can compensate its negative impacts on N2O emission through improving soil quality, maize yield and N use efficiency.

A nitric oxide reductase is a key enzyme target for eliminating fungal emissions of nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide (N2O) derived from agricultural activity is a major contributor to Earth's greenhouse effect. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizer applied at high levels, particularly combined with heavy rainfall events, generates hot spots of N2O emissions in agricultural fields due to the process of microbial denitrification. Here, a key conserved fungal denitrification enzyme necessary for N2O emissions was identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that fungal NOR1-like genes, with rare exceptions, are highly conserved and confined to the phylum Ascomycota. Plant pathogenic Fusarium species that possess NOR1 exhibited drastic differences in N2O production based on denitrification potential. Functional characterization of the p450nor nitric oxide reductase encoding gene, NOR1, in the soil-borne denitrifying maize pathogen, Fusarium verticillioides, showed that this enzyme is critical for fungal N2O production. Deletion of the single copy NOR1 gene in F. verticillioides eliminated N2O emissions. Complementation of deletion mutants via the NOR1 gene add-back restored wild type N2O emission levels and segregation analysis further corroborated the pivotal role of NOR1 for N2O emissions. We suggest targeting of the NOR1 enzyme as an effective strategy to reduce fungal-based N2O emissions. C1 [Oakley, Blake A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Pathol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.

Quantifying nitrous oxide emissions from the foliage of cotton, maize and soybean crops. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming. Most of the N2O emitted from cropping systems is derived from the soil and is closely related to the use of nitrogen (N) fertiliser. However, several reports have shown that small, yet significant, portions of the N2O flux from cropping systems are emitted from the crop foliage. This research aimed to quantify N2O emissions from the foliage of field-grown cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), and included maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) for comparison. We also aimed to identify differences in the timing of N2O emissions from foliage during the day and over an irrigation cycle. Individual plants were isolated from the soil, and the atmosphere surrounding the encapsulated plants was sampled over a 30-min period. Subplots that were previously fertilised with urea at 0, 80, 160, 240 and 320kg N ha(-1) and then sown to cotton were used to measure N2O flux from plants on three occasions. N2O flux from cotton foliage was also measured on five occasions during an 11-day irrigation cycle and at five times throughout one day. N2O flux from foliage accounted for a small but significant portion (13-17%) of the soil-crop N2O flux. N2O flux from foliage varied with plant species, and the time of day the flux was measured. N2O flux from cotton plants was closely related to soil water content. Importantly, the application of N fertiliser was not related to the N2O flux from cotton plants. The most plausible explanation of our results is that a proportion of the N2O that was evolved in the soil was transported through the plant via evapotranspiration, rather than being evolved within the plant. Studies that exclude N2O emissions from crop foliage will significantly underestimate the N2O flux from the system. C1 [Rochester, I.; Wood, C.] CSIRO Agr Flagship, Narrabri, NSW 2390, Australia.

Response of nitrous oxide emissions to individual rain events and future changes in precipitation. Changing precipitation has the potential to alter nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural regions. In this study, we applied the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 end-of-century RCP 8.5 (business as usual) precipitation projections for the U.S. Upper Midwest and examined the effects of mean precipitation changes, characterized by increased early-season rainfall and decreased mid- to late-season rainfall, on N2O emissions from a conventionally managed corn (Zea mays L.) cropping system grown in an indoor mesocosm facility over four growing seasons. We also assessed the response of N2O emissions to over 1,000 individual rain events. Nitrous oxide emissions were most strongly correlated with water-filled pore space (WFPS) and soil nitrogen (N) status. After rain events, the change in N2O emissions, relative to pre-rain emissions, was more likely to be positive when soil NO3- was >40 mg N kg(-1) soil and soil NH4+ was >10 mg N kg(-1) soil and was more likely to be negative when soil NO3- was >40 mg N kg(-1) soil and soil NH4+ was <10 mg N kg(-1) soil. Similarly, hourly N2O emissions remained (-)(2) s(-1) when combined NH4+ + NO3- was <20 mg N kg(-1) soil or NH4+ and NO3- were <5 and 20 mg N kg(-1) soil, respectively. Rain event magnitude did not substantially affect the change in N2O flux. Finally, growing-season N2O emissions, soil moisture, and inorganic N content were not affected by the future precipitation pattern. Near-optimal soil WFPS combined with soil N concentrations above the identified thresholds favor higher N2O emissions.

Nitrous oxide emissions from soils amended by cover-crops and under plastic film mulching: Fluxes, emission factors and yield-scaled emissions. Assessment of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission factor (EF) for N2O emission inventory from arable crops fertilized with different nitrogen sources are under increased scrutiny because of discrepancies between the default IPCC EFs and low EFs reported by many researchers. Mixing ratio of leguminous and non leguminous cover crop residues incorporation and plastic film mulching (PFM) in upland soil has been recommended as a vital agronomic practice to enhance yield and soil quality. However, how these practices together affect N2O emissions, yield-scaled emissions and the EFs remain uncertain. Field experiments spanning two consecutive years were conducted to evaluate the effects of PFM on N2O emissions, yield-scaled emissions and the seasonal EFs in cover crop residues amended soil during maize cultivation. The mixture of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) seeds with 75% recommended dose (RD 140 kg ha(-1)) and 25% recommended dose (RD 90 kg ha(-1)), respectively, were broadcasted during the fallow period and 0, 25, 50 and 100% of the total aboveground harvested biomass that correspond to 0, 76, 152 and 304 kg N ha(-1) were incorporated before maize transplanting. It was found that the mean seasonal EFs from cover crop residues amended soil under No-mulching (NM) and PFM were 1.13% (ranging from 0.81 to 1.23%) and 1.49% (ranging from 1.02 to 1.63%), respectively, which are comparable to the IPCC (2006) default EF (1%) for emission inventories of N2O from crop residues. The emission fluxes were greatly influenced by NH4+-N, NOT-N, DOC and DON contents of soil. The cumulative N2O emissions markedly increased with the increase in cover crop residues application rates and it was more prominent under PFM than under NM. However, the yield-scaled emissions markedly decreased under PFM compared to NM due to the improved yield. With relatively low yield-scaled N2O emissions, 25% biomass mixing ratio of barley and hairy vetch (76 kg N ha(-1)) under PFM could be recommended to enhance yield and to mitigate N2O emissions in an upland maize cropping system.

N2O emissions and yield in maize field fertilized with polymer-coated urea under subsoiling or rotary tillage. Fertilizer application and tillage practices play an important role in agricultural production, whereas excess N input could create considerable N2O emissions. However, it is unclear whether urea types under subsoiling or rotary tillage have effects on yield and N2O emissions in maize field. We investigated the effects on N2O emissions and maize (Zea mays L.) yield of tillage (rotary tillage [R] alone and rotary tillage following subsoiling [S]) and two types of urea (polymer-coated urea [P] and conventional urea [C]) applications, respectively, at the sowing [0] and V6 [6] stages in a clay loam soil. N2O emissions varied from 1 to 11 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Compared with S soil, the R soils produced greater N2O emissions. Compared with conventional urea, polymer-coated urea increased maize production and fertilizer-induced N2O emission, but had no significant effect on yield scaled N2O emission. The increase of N2O emission was mainly related to water-filled pore space affected by tillage and soil nitrate and ammonium N concentrations affected by urea types. Polymer-coated urea topdressing at the V6 stage in S soils was better for producing a higher yield with lower N2O emission. The results indicate that R soils had more significant N2O emission than S soils during a wet climate; and polymer-coated urea can increase grain yield with a slight higher N2O emissions, whereas changing the application stage can decrease the cumulative N2O emissions without reducing the yield.

Nitrous oxide emission from upland crops and crop-soil systems in northeastern China. Although it is known that crops can directly emit N2O, their contribution to the total N2O emission from crop-soil systems under field conditions is not well understood. This study was conducted to study the contribution of crops to total N2O emission from soybean-soil and maize-soil systems in northeastern China. The effects of N fertilization on N2O emission and NO3--N concentration in plants were also studied. The emission from crop-soil systems was measured with the closed chamber method, whereas the direct emission from crops was measured with the soil surface-sealed method. The addition of fertilizer N significantly increased the NO3--N concentration in crops and enhanced the N2O emission from crop-soil systems and from crops alone. The amount of N2O emitted directly from soybean plants accounted for 6 to 11% of the total soybean-soil emission. Similarly, the amount of N2O emitted directly from maize plants accounted for 8.5 to 16% of the total maize-soil emission. The proportion of the applied N lost through direct N2O emission from plants ranged from 0.19 to 0.34%, whereas the proportion of the applied N lost through N2O emission from the crop-soil system ranged from 1.1 to 1.9%. These results suggest that the use of chambers that do not include plants may lead to an underestimation of the total N2O emission from crop-soil systems.

Soil nitrous oxide emissions under different management practices in the semiarid region of the Argentinian Pampas. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of different crop sequences (soybean-corn and soybean-soybean) and tillage systems (no tillage and reduced tillage) on nitrous oxide (N2O) soil emissions under field conditions. The experiment was carried out in Manfredi, Crdoba province, Argentina on an Entic Haplustoll and N2O emissions were measured in the field during a year. N2O fluxes were low during winter, but in late spring it peaked. For fallow, N-NO3-content was the most important variable to explain N2O emissions. For growing period water-filled pores was the main variable explaining N2O emissions. Nitrogen fertilization of corn crop increased N2O-N emissions, whereas no significant differences were found due to the tillage system. Measured annual N2O-N emissions were generally lower than those calculated using the methodology proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Soil N2O and CH4 emissions from fodder maize production with and without riparian buffer strips of differing vegetation. Purpose Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are some of the most important greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of the 21st century. Vegetated riparian buffers are primarily implemented for their water quality functions in agroecosystems. Their location in agricultural landscapes allows them to intercept and process pollutants from adjacent agricultural land. They recycle organic matter, which increases soil carbon (C), intercept nitrogen (N)-rich runoff from adjacent croplands, and are seasonally anoxic. Thus processes producing environmentally harmful gases including N2O and CH4 are promoted. Against this context, the study quantified atmospheric losses between a cropland and vegetated riparian buffers that serve it. Methods Environmental variables and simultaneous N2O and CH4 emissions were measured for a 6-month period in a replicated plot-scale facility comprising maize (Zea mays L.). A static chamber was used to measure gas emissions. The cropping was served by three vegetated riparian buffers, namely: (i) grass riparian buffer; (ii) willow riparian buffer and; (iii) woodland riparian buffer, which were compared with a no-buffer control. Results The no-buffer control generated the largest cumulative N2O emissions of 18.9 kg ha(- 1) (95% confidence interval: 0.5-63.6) whilst the maize crop upslope generated the largest cumulative CH4 emissions (5.1 +/- 0.88 kg ha(- 1)). Soil N2O and CH4-based global warming potential (GWP) were lower in the willow (1223.5 +/- 362.0 and 134.7 +/- 74.0 kg CO2-eq. ha(- 1) year(- 1), respectively) and woodland (1771.3 +/- 800.5 and 3.4 +/- 35.9 kg CO2-eq. ha(- 1) year(- 1), respectively) riparian buffers. Conclusions Our results suggest that in maize production and where no riparian buffer vegetation is introduced for water quality purposes (no buffer control), atmospheric CH4 and N2O concerns may result.

A global synthesis of nitrous oxide emissions across cotton-planted soils. Globally, acquiring information on region- and crop-specific nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is vital for establishing effective N2O mitigation strategies. Soil cultivated with cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an important source of N2O in agricultural production. However, little is known about the magnitudes and main drivers of soil N2O emissions from cotton fields worldwide. In this meta-analysis, we were the first to synthesize 34 peer-reviewed papers (298 observational datasets) to quantify the magnitudes and controlling factors of area-scaled N2O emissions (N2Oarea), direct N2O emission factors (EFd), and yield-scaled N2O emissions (N2Oyield) from the soils of cotton fields and to explore associated potential mitigation strategies. On average, the N2Oarea from global cotton-planted soils was 2.10 kg N ha(-1), with a mean EFd of 0.92 %, which is comparable to those reported for cereal crops (e.g., maize, 1.02 %) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default value of 1 % for global croplands. The global mean N2Oyield estimated here was 622 g N Mg-1. At the global scale, the variations in all N2O-related indices in the soils of cotton fields were demonstrated to be primarily controlled by climatic conditions (e.g. climate type) and soil properties (e.g., bulk density, pH, C/N or soil texture) rather than by well-recognized management practices (e.g., N fertilization rate). Furthermore, our analysis showed that the application of urease and/or nitrification inhibitors significantly reduced soil N2O emissions while maintaining seed cotton yields. These findings emphasize that cotton production has an obvious climate footprint and provide potential N2O mitigation options for the sustainable intensification of cotton production.

Six years of nitrous oxide emissions from temperate cropping systems under real-farm rotational management. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soil were studied during 6 consecutive years on three plots of two real farms. We analyzed a total of 37 agricultural sequences: 20 sequences with crops including wheat, maize, and legumes and 17 fallow sequences with cover crops, volunteers or bare fallow soils. Controlling factors of N2O emissions were disentangled by using three approaches: (i) applying a random forest algorithm then extracting the most important predictors; (ii) analyzing all sequences separately as a function of the rain and soil mineral nitrate (SMN) content in soils; and (iii) experimentally, by watering soils with different SMN contents. The results showed that rainfall (and hence soil moisture) exerted the greatest control over N2O emissions, followed by daily maximum temperature and SMN. Regarding crop sequences, 6-year N2O cumulative emissions rates (g N2O-N ha(-1)) ranked as follows: legumes (967) < maize (1192) < cereals (1375). Lowest cumulative N2O emissions at the Derrier conventional, no-till, farming plot (similar to 6000 kg N ha(-1)) was observed compared to similar to 15000 kg N2O-N ha(-1) measured at the tilled organic farming Chantemerle and Barrie`re plots. Further, cumulative N2O emissions were rather important during fallow periods with or without cover crops. This study thus supports that N2O emissions need to be measured all year round, including both cropping and fallow periods to grasp the full rotation cycles. This long-term study of N2O emissions gathered a large number of data on N2O emissions over a variety of crops and fallow management and helped to initiate a typology of N2O emissions by crop.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi reduce soil N2O 2 O emissions by altering root traits and soil denitrifier community composition. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increase the ability of plants to obtain nitrogen (N) from the soil, and thus can affect emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), 2 O), a long-lived potent greenhouse gas. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of AMF on N2O 2 O emissions are still poorly understood, particularly in agroecosystems with different forms of N fertilizer inputs. Utilizing a mesocosm experiment in field, we examined the effects of AMF on N2O 2 O emissions via their influence on maize root traits and denitrifying microorganisms under ammonia and nitrate fertilizer input using 15 N isotope tracer. Here we show that the presence of AMF alone or both maize roots and AMF increased maize biomass and their 15 N uptake, root length, root surface area, and root volume, but led to a reduction in N2O 2 O emissions under both N input forms. Random forest model showed that root length and surface area were the most important predictors of N2O 2 O emissions. Additionally, the presence of AMF reduced the (nirK nir K + nirS)/nosZ S)/ nos Z ratio by increasing the relative abundance of nirS-Bradyrhizobium S- Bradyrhizobium and Rubrivivax with ammonia input, but reducing nosZ-Azospirillum, Z- Azospirillum , Cupriavidus and Rhodopseudomonas under both fertilizer input. Further, N2O 2 O emissions were significantly and positively correlated with the nos Z-type Azospirillum, , Cupriavidus and Rhodopseudomonas, , but negatively correlated with the nir S-type Bradyrhizobium and Rubrivivax. . These results indicate that AMF reduce N2O 2 O emissions by increasing root length to explore N nutrients and altering the community composition of denitrifiers, suggesting that effective management of N fertilizer forms interacting with the rhizosphere microbiome may help mitigate N2O 2 O emissions under future N input scenarios.

Inhibited effect of biochar application on N2O emissions is amount and time-dependent by regulating denitrification in a wheat-maize rotation system in North China. Biochar application is considered an effective method of reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in soil. However, the mechanism and temporal effect of different doses of biochar on N2O emissions is still obscure. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment to test the effects of different input amounts and frequencies of biochar on soil N2O emissions in North China. Biochar was applied in six different treatments in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system: applications of 0 t/ha biochar (C0), 2.25 t/ha biochar (C1), 4.5 t/ha biochar (C2), 9 t/ha biochar (C3), and 13.5 t/ha biochar (C4) each year, and a single application of 13.5 t/ha biochar (CS) in the first year. The results showed that biochar could inhibit N2O emissions, reaching 20.6% to 60.1% in the wheat season and 18.1% to 39.4% in the maize season. The inhibitory effect of biochar on soil N2O emissions was dependent on amount and time. C3 had the best results in the wheat season, although its inhibitory effect in the maize season was not as good relative to C4 due to the lower biochar application. In addition, CS significantly reduced (27.7%) the cumulative N2O emissions in the first year, although the inhibitory effect disappeared in the second year. Biochar increased the nosZ gene copy numbers and promoted a reduction of N2O in the soil via the denitrification process. In conclusion, the inhibition of N2O emissions during denitrification is an important factor for reducing soil N2O emissions by biochar, and the inhibition of biochar is influenced by the input amount and time.

Nitrogen leaching and indirect nitrous oxide emissions from fertilized croplands in Zimbabwe. Agricultural efforts to end hunger in Africa are hampered by low fertilizer-use-efficiency exposing applied nutrients to losses. This constitutes economic losses and environmental concerns related to leaching and greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of NH4NO3 (0, 60 and 120 kg N ha(-1)) on N uptake, N-leaching and indirect N2O emissions were studied during three maize (Zea mays L.) cropping seasons on clay (Chromic luvisol) and sandy loam (Haplic lixisol) soils in Zimbabwe. Leaching was measured using lysimeters, while indirect N2O emissions were calculated from leached N using the emission factor methodology. Results showed accelerated N-leaching (3-26 kg ha(-1) season(-1)) and N-uptake (10-92 kg ha(-1)) with N input. Leached N in groundwater had potential to produce emission increments of 0-94 g N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1) on clay soil, and 5-133 g N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1) on sandy loam soil following the application of NH4NO3. In view of this short-term response intensive cropping using relatively high N rate may be more appropriate for maize in areas whose soils and climatic conditions are similar to those investigated in this study, compared with using lower N rates or no N over relatively larger areas to attain a targeted food security level.

Soil organic carbon availability determines the role of crop straws in regulating N2O emissions from maize agroecosystems. Straw return enhances soil quality and cropland sustainability but increases risks of inducing larger nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to the simultaneous input of carbon and nitrogen (N). However, the response of N2O emissions to straw remains controversial, depending on the management-driven dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC), especially its availability. Here, two fields with the same SOC quantity but distinct availability (HCA and LCA, i.e., high vs. low lability) were established with a factorial design of fertilization and straw, to track the straw decomposition, N2O fluxes, available substrates, and N-cycling microbes. Furthermore, a meta-analysis was integrated with the field experiments to decipher how SOC availability regulates N2O emissions responding to straw returning. Meta-analysis revealed that SOC availability mediates the effect of straw return on N2O emissions from maize agroecosystems, with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) identified as the primary regulator of response direction and magnitude, and exhibits a negative correlation with N2O emission response. Consistently, our field experiments showed that straw incorporation combined with fertilization significantly reduced N2O emissions by 22 % in HCA soils but increased emissions by 55 % in LCA soils. Straw incorporation into HCA facilitated bacterial growth while reducing AOB abundance and ammonium supply, suggesting restricted nitrification due to promotion of N immobilization, which ultimately suppressed N2O emissions. Conversely, straw in LCA soils exhibited a faster decomposition rate and stimulated denitrifiers (nirS and nirK) metabolism by increasing DOC concentration and biodegradability, leading to increased N2O emissions. Consequently, the fertilizer-induced N2O emission factor decreased from 1.53 % to 1.11 % by straw for HCA, while increased from 0.67 % to 1.19 % for LCA. Overall, these findings highlight that SOC availability determines the direction and magnitude of straw's impact on N2O emissions, which should be fully considered into sustainable straw management strategies to balance SOC improvement against climate change.

Crop intensification with sustainable practices did not increase N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most important greenhouse gas produced by agricultural soils and is a byproduct of microbial nitrification and denitrification processes. The N2O emission rates depend on soil, climatic and management factors. The objectives of this study were i) to evaluate N2O emissions during a barley crop period and its subsequent barley-maize interperiod, under two management systems, and ii) to relate the N2O flux rates with soil mineral N content, waterfilled pore space (WFPS) and soil temperature. These periods are part of three-year crop sequence (barley - maize - soybean) of a long-term experiment under two management systems, ecological intensification (EI) and farmer current practices (FP). For the analyzed period, the EI system included a cover crop after barley and higher N rates, with split application, compared to FP. N2O emissions were monitored weekly using a static chambers method. Simultaneously, the mineral N content (NO3-N and NH4+-N), WFPS and soil temperature at 10 cm depth were determined. The flux of N2O-N ranged from 6 to 61 mu g of N2O-N m2 h-1 during the barley crop and between 1.5 and 47 mu g of N2O-N m2 h-1 during the barley-maize interperiod, without significant differences between management systems. N2O emissions were controlled by soil temperature and %WFPS according to a multiple regression analysis. NH4+-N and NO3-N soil content did not enter into any model as a regulator of N2O flux. During the barley period there was a significant effect of the WFPS x soil temperature interaction since N2O emissions increased with soil temperature only at WFPS > 40 %. During the barley-maize interperiod, there were significant positive effects of WFPS and temperature on N2O emissions with no significant WFPS x temperature interaction. The cumulative emissions of N2O-N were not different between management systems during the barley crop (IE=646 and FP=757 g N2O-N ha-1) or during barley-maize interperiod (IE=816 and FP=754 g N2O-N ha-1). Throughout the study period, the combination of management practices in EI increased barley yield and did not increase N2O emissions with respect to FP, despite higher N rates and the inclusion of cover crop in EI. The intensification of crops does not necessarily increase N2O emissions from agricultural soils as long as the crops are conducted with appropriate management practices.

Reducing nitrous oxide emissions from a maize-wheat sequence by decreasing soil nitrate concentration: effects of split application of pig slurry and dicyandiamide. Pig slurry (PS) is a valuable nitrogen (N) source for agricultural crops but the simultaneous supply of readily decomposable carbon and mineral N can result in large soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Our objective was to determine the individual and combined effects of split PS application and addition of a nitrification inhibitor (dicyandiamide, DCD) on N2O emissions and soil mineral N concentration in southern Brazil. Soil N2O fluxes were measured from November 2010 to November 2011 from a maize (Zea maysL.)-wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) sequence under various fertilizer treatments: no-N control, PS applied in a single pre-plant dose with or without DCD, PS split-applied with or without DCD, and urea split-applied. Cumulative N2O emissions increased linearly (R-2=0.73) with increasing soil nitrate (NO3-) exposure, indicating that management practices aimed at reducing soil NO3- concentrations can decrease soil N2O emissions. In total for the two crops, splitting PS reduced N2O emission factors (EF) by 33%, whereas the addition of DCD reduced EF by 60 and 41% when PS was applied in single and split doses, respectively. However, splitting PS or adding DCD failed to reduce N2O losses more than a single pre-plant PS application in maize where background soil NO3- concentrations were large. The addition of DCD to PS applied as a single pre-plant dose resulted in the largest reduction in soil N2O emissions, whereas splitting PS with and without DCD resulted in significantly smaller abatements. Consequently, we concluded that adding DCD to PS in a single pre-plant application is a better option than splitting PS applications for reducing soil N2O emissions in no-till cereal cropping systems in southern Brazil.

Effect of biochar and liming on soil nitrous oxide emissions from a temperate maize cropping system. Biochar, a carbon-rich, porous pyrolysis product of organic residues may positively affect plant yield and can, owing to its inherent stability, promote soil carbon sequestration when amended to agricultural soils. Another possible effect of biochar is the reduction in emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). A number of laboratory incubations have shown significantly reduced N2O emissions from soil when mixed with biochar. Emission measurements under field conditions however are more scarce and show weaker or no reductions, or even increases in N2O emissions. One of the hypothesised mechanisms for reduced N2O emissions from soil is owing to the increase in soil pH following the application of alkaline biochar. To test the effect of biochar on N2O emissions in a temperate maize cropping system, we set up a field trial with a 20 t ha(-1) biochar treatment, a limestone treatment adjusted to the same pH as the biochar treatment (pH 6.5), and a control treatment without any addition (pH 6.1). An automated static chamber system measured N2O emissions for each replicate plot (n = 3) every 3.6 h over the course of 8 months. The field was conventionally fertilised at a rate of 160 kgNha(-1) in three applications of 40, 80 and 40 kgNha(-1) as ammonium nitrate. Cumulative N2O emissions were 52% smaller in the biochar compared to the control treatment. However, the effect of the treatments overall was not statistically significant (p = 0.27) because of the large variability in the data set. Limed soils emitted similar mean cumulative amounts of N2O as the control. There is no evidence that reduced N2O emissions with biochar relative to the control is solely caused by a higher soil pH.

Modelling adaptation measures to improve maize production and reduce soil N2O emissions under climate change in Northeast China. Optimizing management practices is essential to guarantee crop yield and reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the sustainable agricultural production under climate change. The objectives of this study were to i) calibrate and evaluate the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model using the measurements of maize yield, nitrogen (N) uptake, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil inorganic N and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a 5-year maize field experiment in Northeast China (NEC) and ii) simulate the impacts of climate change on maize yield and N2O emissions and explore adaptation strategies based on DNDC modelling. For N-fertilized treatments (farmers' practice, FP-N; current optimized management, OPT-N), the DNDC model overall showed \"good\" performance in simulating maize yield, aboveground biomass, N uptake and soil inorganic N based on the average statistical values. The model also performed well in simulating soil moisture, soil temperature and N2O emissions. For N-unfertilized treatments, however, the DNDC model overestimated crop yield and N uptake mainly due to the overestimation of crop growth under low-temperature stress conditions, and the underestimation of soil inor-ganic N resulted from the underestimated N mineralization and N availability from the dissolved inorganic N pools under continuous N deficiency. The DNDC model showed that compared to the baseline scenario, future climate change would improve the maize yield (1.4-8.8%) while increasing the N2O emissions (37.6-83.4%) without adaptation measures in NEC. Compared to OPT-N management, solely adjusting N fertilization rate (200-220 kg N ha-1) would concurrently increase maize yield (5.0-8.7%) and N2O emissions (0.9-18.6%), while the adoption of optimized planting dates (April 27th to May 18th), new cultivars (with thermal degree days ranging from 2550 to 2700 degrees C), and the implementation of no-tillage and maize-soybean rotation would increase the maize yield by 1.8-8.9% and reduce the N2O emissions by 0.7-26.5% under future climate change scenarios. This study provided insights into the adaptive management strategies for the sustainable maize production under climate change in NEC.

Nitrous oxide emission from an irrigated cotton field under semiarid subtropical conditions. In a 1-year study, quantification of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was made from a flood-irrigated cotton field fertilized with urea at 100kg N ha(-1) a(-1). Measurements were made during the cotton-growing season (May-November) and the fallow period (December-April). Of the total 95 sampling dates, 77 showed positive N2O fluxes (range, 0.1 to 33.3g N ha(-1) d(-1)), whereas negative fluxes (i.e., N2O sink activity) were recorded on 18 occasions (range, -0.1 to -2.2g N ha(-1) stop d(-1)). Nitrous oxide sink activity was more frequently observed during the growing season (15 out of 57 sampling dates) as compared to the fallow period (3 out of 38 sampling dates). During the growing season, contribution of N2O to the denitrification gaseous N products was much less (average, 4%) as compared to that during the fallow period (average, 21%). Nitrous oxide emission integrated over the 6-month growing period amounted 324g N ha(-1), whereas the corresponding figure for the 6-month fallow period was 648g N ha(-1). Subtracting the N2O sink activity (30.3g N ha(-1) and 3.8g N ha(-1) during the growing season and fallow period, respectively), the net N2O emission amounted 938g N ha(-1) a(-1). Results suggested that high soil moisture and temperature prevailing under flood-irrigated cotton in the Central Punjab region of Pakistan though favor high denitrification rates, but are also conducive to N2O reduction thus leading to relatively low N2O emission.

N2O fluxes and direct N2O emission factors from maize cultivation on Oxisols in Thailand. The application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers to agricultural soils is a primary source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to the atmosphere. The default emission factor (EF) suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is 1.0% of fertilizers-N applied to agricultural soils. This EF has been found to vary significantly in time and space and country specific EF is needed to improve the reliability of greenhouse gas inventory. In this study, direct N2O emission factor in a silt loam soil cultivated with maize was investigated using the static chamber method. Daily N2O fluxes from three treatments: control (T1), and two N application rates of 97 (T2) and 155 (T3) kg N ha(-1) were studied in the field experiments. Results indicated that the average N2O fluxes (average +/- S.E.) in T1, T2 and T3 treatments for three cropping cycles were 0.54 +/- 0.26, 0.81 +/- 0.26 and 0.98 +/- 0.27 mg N2O m(-2) day(-1), respectively. N2O emissions increased sharply after 5-7 days of N fertilization application, with the highest value corresponding to 18-32% of total N2O emissions. The average EFs for three crops were 0.0082 +/- 0.0022 kg N2O-Nkg(-1) N for T2 (0.82% of N applied) and 0.0059 +/- 0.0014 kgN(2)O-Nkg(-1) N for T3 (0.59% of N applied). It was found that the total N2O emissions as well as maize yields varied between wet and dry seasons. It is thus recommended that atleast both wet and dry croppings are included when country specifics EFs are developed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the RZWQM2 (Root Zone Water Quality Model) was used to simulate the responses of N2O emissions to different Nitrogen application rates on an irrigated corn field from 2003 to 2006, in eastern Colorado, USA. Four different algorithms from the literature were coupled with RZWQM2 and compared for simulating N2O emissions during nitrification and denitrification processes. The RZWQM2 was first calibrated for corn yield, N uptake, soil water (0-10 cm) and soil Nitrate-N content (0-180 cm) and the simulated daily nitrification and denitrification rates were used to calculate N2O emission using the algorithms from DAYCENT, NOE (Nitrous Oxide Emissions), WNMM (Water and Nitrogen Management Model), and FASSET models. The best N2O emission was simulated when the fraction of N2O release from nitrification was modified by water filled pore space (WFPS) as in the NOE model and the fraction N2O release from denitrification was adopted from the DAYCENT model.

Predicting greenhouse gas benefits of improved nitrogen management in North American maize. Farmers, food supply companies, and policymakers need practical yet scientifically robust methods to quantify how improved nitrogen (N) fertilizer management can reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. To meet this need, we developed an empirical model based on published field data for predicting N2O emission from rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) fields managed with inorganic N fertilizer in the United States and Canada. Nitrous oxide emissions ranged widely on an area basis (0.03-32.9 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and a yield-scaled basis (0.006-4.8 kg N Mg-1 grain yr-1). We evaluated multiple modeling approaches and variables using three metrics of model fit (Akaike information criteria corrected for small sample sizes [AICc], RMSE, and R-2). Ourmodel explains 32.8% of the total observed variation and 50% of observed site-level variation. Soil clay content was very important for predicting N2O emission and predicting the change in N2O emission due to a change in N balance, with the addition of a clay fixed effect explaining 37% of site-level variation. Sites with higher clay content showed greater reductions in N2O emission for a given reduction in N balance. Therefore, high-clay sites are particularly important targets for reducing N2O emissions. Our linear mixed model is more suitable for predicting the effect of improved N management on N2O emission in maize fields than other published models because it (a) requires only input data readily available on working farms, (b) is derived from field observations, (c) correctly represents differences among sites using a mixedmodeling approach, and (d) includes soil texture because it strongly influences N2O emissions.

Soil Greenhouse Gas Fluxes From Maize Production Under Different Soil Fertility Management Practices in East Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), few studies have quantified greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions following application of soil amendments, for development of accurate national GHG inventories. Therefore, this study quantified soil GHG emissions using static chambers for two maize cropping seasons (one full year) of four different soil amendments in the central highlands of Kenya. The four treatments were (i) animal manure, (ii) inorganic fertilizer, (iii) combined animal manure and inorganic fertilizer, and (iv) a no-N control (no amendment) laid out in a randomized complete block design. Cumulative annual soil fluxes (February 2017 to February 2018) ranged from -1.03 +/- 0.19 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1)from the manure inorganic fertilizer treatment to -0.09 +/- 0.03 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1)from the manure treatment, 1,391 +/- 74 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)from the control treatment to 3,574 +/- 113 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)from the manure treatment, and 0.13 +/- 0.08 to 1.22 +/- 0.12 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)in the control and manure treatments, respectively. Animal manure amendment produced the highest cumulative CO(2)emissions (P < 0.001), N2O emissions (P < 0.001), and maize yields (P = 0.002) but the lowest N2O yield-scaled emission (YSE) (0.5 g N2O-N kg(-1)grain yield). Manure combined with inorganic fertilizer had the highest cumulative CH(4)uptake (P < 0.001) and N2O YSE (2.2 g N2O-N kg(-1)grain yield). Our results indicate that while the use of animal manure may increase total GHG emissions, the concurrent increase in maize yields results in reduced yield-scaled GHG emissions.

Effects of soil moisture, temperature, and nitrogen fertilization on soil respiration and nitrous oxide emission during maize growth period in northeast China. To evaluate the response of soil respiration and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission to soil moisture, temperature and nitrogen fertilization, and to estimate the contribution of soil and rhizosphere to total soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and N2O emissions, a field experiment was conducted in the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in the northeast of China. The experiment included four treatments: bare soil fertilized with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (CK), and maize-cropped soils amended with 0 (N0), 150 (N150), and 250 (N250) kg N ha-1 yr-1. The cumulative soil CO2 emission in the CK, N0, N150, and N250 treatments was estimated to be 698, 863, 962, and 854 g CO2 C m-2, respectively. The seasonal soil CO2 fluxes were significantly affected by soil temperature, with a Q10 value between 1.99 and 2.47. Analysis of the stepwise regression indicated that the CO2 flux can be quantitatively described by a linear combination of soil moisture content and soil temperature 5 cm below ground. Approximately 70, 58, 60, and 44% of the variability in CO2 flux can be explained by these two parameters, in CK, N0, N150, and N250, respectively. Nitrogen fertilization with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 increased CO2 fluxes by 14.5% compared with soils fertilized with 0 kg N ha-1 yr-1. However, in the soil fertilized with 250 kg N ha-1 yr-1, high N fertilization suppressed soil respiration. There was an exponential relationship between soil temperature 5 cm below ground and N2O flux, with a Q10 value of 1.30-2.91. Mean cumulative soil N2O emissions during the maize-growing season in the CK, N0, N150, and N250 treatments were estimated to be 86, 44, 200, and 484 mg N2O-N m-2, respectively. In contrast to the maize planting, soil fertilized with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and with 250 kg N ha-1 yr-1 increased N2O fluxes by 354 and 1000%, compared with soils fertilized with 0 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Soil respiration and N2O fluxes measurement using the root-exclusion technique indicated that the rhizosphere of the maize could be the dominant habitat of soil respiration and N2O formation.

Strategies for mitigating nitrous oxide emissions from weathered soils fertilized with urea. Various strategies, particularly those that affect nitrogen (N)-related processes at the soil plant interface, have been investigated to enhance N-agronomic efficiency (AE) and reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils fertilized with urea, the main N source employed in Brazilian agriculture. This study aimed to evaluate the AE and the N2O emissions from soils cultivated with maize in soybean-maize succession following treatment with different mitigation approaches in Southern Amazon. An experiment of randomized block design was performed involving seven treatments in which maize was cultivated in soil: (T1) under control conditions; (T2) inoculated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB); (T3) fertilized with urea; (T4) inoculated with NFB and fertilized with urea; (T5) fertilized with urea containing the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD); (T6) fertilized with urea containing the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT); (T7) fertilized with urea containing a combination of DCD and NBPT. The highest N2O fluxes (300 mu g N2O-N m-2 h-1) were recorded for T3 and T4 around 12-14 days after top dressing fertilization with urea. Application of DCD-containing urea (T5 and, to a lesser extent, T7) was effective in reducing N2O emissions. Emission factors were below of 1% for all treatments, with the highest values (<= 0.42%) recorded for T3, T4 and T6. Fertilization with urea containing DCD alone or in combination with NBPT (T5 and T7) improved the grain yield, the AE, the yield-scaled N2O and reduced emission factors values by around 75% to the level registered for T3. Use of nitrification inhibitors represents an alternative for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions during the off-season maize cropping cycle in Southern Amazon.

Contribution of N2O and NH3 to total greenhouse gas emission from fertilization: results from a sandy soil fertilized with nitrate and biogas digestate with and without nitrification inhibitor. Fertilization with biogas residues from the digestion of energy crops is of growing importance. Digestate from silage maize (Zea mays L.) is a new fertilizer with a high potential for ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different maize fertilization systems [180 kg N ha(-1) in form of calcium nitrate (MIN), biogas digestate from maize (DIG) and biogas digestate from maize mixed with the nitrification inhibitor Piadin (DIG + NI)] on the emission of NH3 and N2O from a sandy soil and to assess the total greenhouse gas emission of these fertilization systems. The study is based on a randomized field plot experiment in central Germany and an experimental period of a full year. Annual N2O-N emission was generally low [0.21 (MIN) to 0.37 (DIG) kg N ha(-1)] without differences between treatments. The application of Piadin reduced N2O emissions by 37 and 62 % during the weeks following digestate application but the annual N2O emission was not affected by the fertilization treatment. NH3 emission was only significant for treatments fertilized with digestate. It was not affected by Piadin and accounted for 27 % (+NI) and 29 % of the applied ammonium. Total greenhouse gas emission was dominated by NH3 losses (reducing the fertilizer value and inducing indirect N2O emissions) for the treatments fertilized with maize digestate. The most important greenhouse gas emission source of the MIN treatment were emissions from fertilizer production. Our results show the high potential of digestate from maize as a new source of NH3 emission. Mitigation measures are essential to save the value of this new fertilizer type and to reduce atmospheric and environmental pollution by direct emission of NH3 and indirect emission of greenhouse gases.

We quantified soil GHG annual fluxes from smallholder maize cropping systems under four different soil fertility management technologies in the Central Highlands of Kenya. We regularly sampled GHG from 2nd March 2018 to 1st March 2019 (1 year) in three maize farms using a static chamber technique. The fertility management technologies were: inorganic fertilizer, animal manure, animal manure combined with inorganic fertilizer, and a Control (No external input). The experimental design was a randomized complete block design replicated thrice. Cumulative annual soil fluxes ranged from -2.40 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the control treatment to -1.62 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the manure combined with inorganic fertilizer treatment, 4810 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the control treatment to 6576 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the inorganic fertilizer treatment, and 0.21 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) from the control treatment to 0.38 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) from the inorganic fertilizer treatment for CH4, CO2, and N2O fluxes, respectively.

A combination of manure and inorganic fertilizer produced the highest CH4 fluxes (p = 0.035) across treatments. We concluded that a judicious combination of organic resources (animal manure) and inorganic resources (fertilizer) has the potential to enhance food security while mitigating soil greenhouse gas emissions in SSA.

It was found that application of anaerobic digested cow manure stimulated maize development in an alkaline saline soil and increased emissions of CO2 and N2O.

Nitrous oxide fluxes from manure-amended soil under maize. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by agricultural soils are influenced by farming practices. The application of manure to cultivated land modifies soil microbial activity by supplying additional quantities of C and N and changing soil physical and chemical properties. Nitrous oxide fluxes at the surface of a soil under maize (Zea mays L.) amended with dairy cattle manure were measured from April to October 1993 using closed chambers. The manure application rates were 0, 56, and 112 Mg ha(-1) corresponding to 0, 170, and 339 kg ha(-1) of total N, respectively. Nitrate and NH4+ were measured in soil samples obtained at the same time that gas flux measurements were made. Nitrous oxide concentrations in the soil profile were quantified by sampling soil air at depths of 5 and 15 cm using stationary air probes. On the manured plots 67% of the total N2O emitted during the growing season occurred during the first 7 wk following manure application. Fluxes of N2O occurred in episodes with maxims that ranged from 0.070 mg m(-2) h(-1) on the soil without manure amendment to 0.171 and 0.494 mg m(-2) h(-1) on sons that had received the low and high rates of manure, respectively. These high fluxes coincided with periods when NO3-N levels and soil water contents were relatively high. Fluxes were highest the first day after manure application and returned to near preapplication levels 7 d later. This episode was followed by short-lived peaks of N2O flux that usually followed periods of rain. The absence of a strong correlation between N2O concentration in the soil profile and N2O flux at the soil surface suggested that high soil water content restricted gaseous diffusion in the soil and/or that a variable part of the N2O produced via denitrification was reduced to N-2. The accumulated N2O-N emissions at the soil surface of the manured plots over the snow-free season amounted to 1% of the manure N that was potentially mineralizable during the experiment.

Effects of the nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin and tillage practices on yield-scaled nitrous oxide emission from a maize field in Iran. Nitrification inhibitors can effectively decrease nitrification rates and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission while increasing crop yield under certain conditions. However, there is no information available on the effects of nitrification inhibitors and tillage practices on N2O emissions from maize cropping in Iran. To study how tillage practices and nitrapyrin (a nitrification inhibitor) affect N2O emission, a split factorial experiment using a completely randomized block design with three replications was carried out in Northeast Iran, which has a cold semiarid climate. Two main plots were created with conventional tillage and minimum tillage levels, and two nitrogen (N) fertilizer (urea) management systems (with and without nitrapyrin application) were created as subplots. Tillage level did not have any significant effect on soil ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3) concentrations, cumulative amount and yield-scaled N2O emission, and aboveground biomass of maize, whereas nitrapyrin application showed significant effect. Nitrapyrin application significantly reduced the cumulative amount of N2O emission by 41% and 32% in conventional tillage and minimum tillage practices, respectively. A reduction in soil NO3 concentration by nitrapyrin was also observed. The average yield-scaled N2O emission was 13.6 g N2O-N kg(-1) N uptake in both tillage systems without nitrapyrin application and was significantly reduced to 7.9 and 8.2 g N2O-N kg(-1) N uptake upon the application of nitrapyrin in minimum tillage and conventional tillage practices, respectively. Additionally, nitrapyrin application increased maize biomass yield by 4% and 13% in the minimum tillage and conventional tillage systems, respectively. Our results indicate that nitrapyrin has a potential role in reducing N2O emission from agricultural systems where urea fertilizers are broadcasted, which is common in Iran due to the practice of traditional farming.

Nitrous Oxide Emission and Grain Yield in Chinese Winter Wheat-Summer Maize Rotation: A Meta-Analysis. A systematic understanding of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and grain yield in winter wheat-summer maize rotation, one of the most important cereal cropping systems in China, is still lacking. The primary aim of this study was to quantify the N2O emissions and grain yield, as well as responses to mitigation strategies, in this intensively managed agroecosystem. We conducted a pairwise meta-analysis by compiling a comprehensive dataset of annual N2O emissions (n = 530) and grain yields (n = 352) from peer reviewed publications. The N2O emissions increased with nitrogen (N) fertilizer input rates following a linear model (r(2) = 0.295, p < 0.001), giving a specific emission coefficient and background emission of 0.71% and 0.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The grain yields responded to the N input rates following a linear-plateau model (r(2) = 0.478, p < 0.001), giving an optimal N input rate and maximum grain yield of 405 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 15.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The meta-analyses revealed that reducing N fertilizers (approximately 50% of the full N input), water-saving irrigation, reduced or no tillage, and applying enhanced efficiency fertilizers significantly decreased N2O emissions (range: -45% to -9%) and increased or did not impact grain yields (range: -1% to -3%). We recommend that reducing agricultural inputs (i.e., N fertilizers, irrigation, and tillage) is a feasible N2O mitigation strategy in the intensively managed winter wheat-summer maize rotation that can be employed without additional environmental risks.

Biochar-mediated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from soil amended with anaerobic digestates. This investigation examines nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from soil with simultaneous amendments of anaerobic digestates and biochar. The main source of anthropogenic emissions of N2O is agriculture and in particular, manure and slurry application to fields. Anaerobic digestates are increasingly used as a fertiliser and interest is growing in their potential as sources of N2O via nitrification and denitrification. Biochar is a stable product of pyrolysis and may affect soil properties such as cation exchange capacity and water holding capacity. Whilst work has been conducted on the effects of biochar amendment on N2O emissions in soils fertilised with mineral fertilisers and raw animal manures, little work to date has focused on the effects of biochar on nitrogen transformations within soil amended with anaerobic digestates. The aim of the current investigation was to quantify the effects of biochar application on ammonification, nitrification and N2O fluxes within soil amended with three anaerobic digestates derived from different feedstocks. A factorial experiment was undertaken in which a sandy loam soil (Dunnington Heath series) was either left untreated, or amended with three different anaerobic digestates and one of three biochar treatments; 0%, 1% or 3%. Nitrous oxide emissions were greatest from soil amended with anaerobic digestate originating from a maize feedstock. Biochar amendment reduced N2O emissions from all treatments, with the greatest effect observed in treatments with maximum emissions. The degree of N2O production and efficacy of biochar amelioration of gas emissions is discussed in context of soil microbial biomass and soil available carbon. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The Effect of Biochar and Straw Return on N2O Emissions and Crop Yield: A Three-Year Field Experiment. To evaluate the effects of application of biochar and straw return for consecutive years on N2O emissions and crop yields in North China, a three-year field experiment of applying biochar and straw following a ten-year application was conducted in a wheat-maize rotation system. Four treatments were set up, including F (NPK fertilizer only); FB (NPK fertilizer + 9.0 t<middle dot>ha(-1) biochar); FS (NPK fertilizer + straw); and FSB ((NPK fertilizer + 9.0 t<middle dot>ha(-1) biochar combined with straw). The results showed that compared with the F treatment, the FB treatment significantly reduced soil N2O emissions by 20.2%, while the FS and FSB treatments increased it by 23.7% and 41.4%, respectively. The FB treatment reduced soil N2O emissions by 15.1% in the wheat season and 23.2% in the maize season, respectively. The FS and FSB treatments increased the N2O emissions by 20.7% and 36.7% in the wheat season, respectively, and by 25.5% and 44.2% in the maize season, respectively. In the wheat season, the soil water content (SWC), NO3--N content and pH were the main influencing factors of the soil N2O emissions. In the maize season, SWC and NO3--N content were the main influencing factors. In addition, the FB, FS and FSB treatments increased the crop yield by 4.99%, 8.40% and 10.25% compared with the F treatment, respectively. In conclusion, consecutive application of biochar can significantly reduce N2O emissions and improve crop yield. Although FS and FSB treatments can also improve the crop yield, they are not beneficial to suppressing N2O emissions. Therefore, the successive application of biochar is an effective measure to reduce N2O emissions and maintain crop yield.

Composted maize straw under fungi inoculation reduces soil N2O emissions and mitigates the microbial N limitation in a wheat upland. Enhancement of microbial assimilation of inorganic nitrogen (N) by straw addition is believed to be an effective pathway to improve farmland N cycling. However, the effectiveness of differently pretreated straws on soil N2O emissions and soil N-acquiring enzyme activities remains unclear. In this study, a pot experiment with four treatments (I, no addition, CK; II, respective addition of maize straw, S; III, composted maize straw under no fungi inoculation, SC; and IV, composted maize straw under fungi inoculation, SCPA) at the same quantity of carbon (C) input was conducted under the same amount of inorganic N fertilization. Results showed that the seasonal cumulative N2O emissions following the SCPA treatment were the lowest at 4.03 kg N ha(-1), representing a significant reduction of 19 % compared with the CK treatment. The S and SC treatments had no significant effects on N2O emissions. The decrease of soil N2O emissions following the SCPA treatment was mainly attributed to the increase of microbial N assimilation and the increased abundance of functional genes related to N2O reductase. The SCPA treatment significantly decreased soil alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and increased leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) activity at the basal fertilization, while increased soil ALP and LAP activity, decreased soil N-Acetyl-beta-D-Glucosidase (NAG) activity at harvest. Compared with the CK treatment, the S, SC, and SCPA treatment significantly increased soil beta-glucosidase (beta-GC) activity at harvest. The decrease in the (NAG+LAP)/ALP ratio following the SCPA treatment indicated that the composted maize straw under fungi inoculation alleviated microbial N limitation at harvest. Moreover, PICRUSt analysis also suggested that the SCPA treatment increased the abundance of bacterial genes associated with N assimilation and N2O reduction, whereas the S and SC treatment did not significantly affect the abundance of N2O reduction genes compared with the CK treatment. Our results suggest that the composted maize straw under fungi inoculation would reduce the risk of N2O emissions and effectively mitigate the microbial N limitation in dryland wheat system.

Emissions of nitrous oxide and methane after field application of liquid organic fertilizers and biochar. The use of anaerobic digestates as fertilizer is proposed as a means to close agricultural nutrient cycles. However, digestates have higher inorganic nitrogen contents than raw manures, which could translate into increased emissions of potent greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). To mitigate these emissions, the addition of biochar with high nutrient absorption capacity is suggested. To quantify the effects of anaerobic digestion and biochar amendment on N2O and CH4 emissions, we conducted a study over 33 months with four different crops (silage maize, winter wheat, winter barley, and forage grass). We measured soil parameters such as mineral nitrogen, moisture, and temperature. The N2O emissions after application of digestates were generally similar to those observed after cattle slurry or mineral fertilizer application. The highest N2O emissions were observed in the first year of the experiment during maize cultivation and were strongly influenced by high soil nitrate concentrations, which were likely linked to enhanced soil organic N mineralization after ley termination. The CH4 emissions were mostly negative. The addition of biochar to co-digested manure before application at an annual rate of 2 t ha  1 had no effect on N2O emissions but led to short-lived CH4 peaks from organic fertilizers directly after spreading. We conclude that digestates do not promote larger N2O emissions than mineral fertilizers or cattle slurry, and that biochar addition to digestates in small application quantities does not reduce N2O emissions but bears the risk of CH4 release.

Stimulation of N2O emission by manure application to agricultural soils may largely offset carbon benefits: a global meta-analysis. Animal manure application as organic fertilizer does not only sustain agricultural productivity and increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, but also affects soil nitrogen cycling and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, given that the sign and magnitude of manure effects on soil N2O emissions is uncertain, the net climatic impact of manure application in arable land is unknown. Here, we performed a global meta-analysis using field experimental data published in peer-reviewed journals prior to December 2015. In this meta-analysis, we quantified the responses of N2O emissions to manure application relative to synthetic N fertilizer application from individual studies and analyzed manure characteristics, experimental duration, climate, and soil properties as explanatory factors. Manure application significantly increased N2O emissions by an average 32.7% (95% confidence interval: 5.1-58.2%) compared to application of synthetic N fertilizer alone. The significant stimulation of N2O emissions occurred following cattle and poultry manure applications, subsurface manure application, and raw manure application. Furthermore, the significant stimulatory effects on N2O emissions were also observed for warm temperate climate, acid soils (pH < 6.5), and soil texture classes of sandy loam and clay loam. Average direct N2O emission factors (EFs) of 1.87% and 0.24% were estimated for upland soils and rice paddy soils receiving manure application, respectively. Although manure application increased SOC stocks, our study suggested that the benefit of increasing SOC stocks as GHG sinks could be largely offset by stimulation of soil N2O emissions and aggravated by CH4 emissions if, particularly for rice paddy soils, the stimulation of CH4 emissions by manure application was taken into account.

Nonlinear response of N2O flux to incremental fertilizer addition in a continuous maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system. The relationship between nitrous oxide (N2O) flux and N availability in agricultural ecosystems is usually assumed to be linear, with the same proportion of nitrogen lost as N2O regardless of input level. We conducted a 3-year, high-resolution N fertilizer response study in southwest Michigan USA to test the hypothesis that N2O fluxes increase mainly in response to N additions that exceed crop N needs. We added urea ammonium nitrate or granular urea at nine levels (0-292 kg N ha(-1)) to four replicate plots of continuous maize. We measured N2O fluxes and available soil N biweekly following fertilization and grain yields at the end of the growing season. From 2001 to 2003 N2O fluxes were moderately low (ca. 20 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1)) at levels of N addition to 101 kg N ha(-1), where grain yields were maximized, after which fluxes more than doubled (to > 50 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1)). This threshold N2O response to N fertilization suggests that agricultural N2O fluxes could be reduced with no or little yield penalty by reducing N fertilizer inputs to levels that just satisfy crop needs.

Distinguishing direct N2O emissions from 15N-labeled manure compost, urea, and maize roots in a field study. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural activities are a significant contributor to global anthropogenic N2O emissions. Sustainable agriculture practices, including using manure compost to replace nitrogen (N) fertilizers, can reduce chemical fertilizer use and minimize negative impacts on soil health and water quality. However, the direct contributions of manure compost to N2O emissions have not been fully studied. We conducted a field study to distinguish the direct contributions of manure compost, urea, and residual maize roots to N2O emissions in an integrated crop-livestock agricultural system in Shandong Province, China. Using the N-15-labeling technique, we found that the majority (93.3%) of cumulative N2O emissions originated from the soil and other unaccounted sources. Notably, manure compost contributed 1.3%, while current-year urea, residual urea with root exudates, and maize root accounted for 3.4%, 1.9%, and 0.03% of cumulative N2O, respectively. Our results also demonstrated that applying manure compost in combination with urea resulted in lower seed yield-scaled N2O emissions (0.046 g N2O-N kg(-1) seed) compared to applying urea alone, even when the total N input was identical, suggesting the potential of manure compost in a more sustainable agriculture model. The low emission factor of manure compost (0.005%) compared to urea (0.019%) supports this potential, indicating the slow-release nature of manure may mitigate N2O while maintaining crop yield. Additionally, the overall low emissions may be attributed to the relatively high soil pH (8.17), which influences the denitrification product ratio, favoring the conversion of N2O to N-2. Our study provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to N2O emissions in integrated crop-livestock farming systems, and highlights the importance of distinguishing multiple sources of N2O emissions to develop effective strategies for reducing emissions while promoting sustainable agriculture.

Biochar helps enhance maize productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions under balanced fertilization in a rainfed low fertility inceptisol. Maize production plays an important role in global food security, especially in arid and poor-soil regions. Its production is also increasing in China in terms of both planting area and yield. However, maize productivity in rainfed croplands is constrained by low soil fertility and moisture insufficiency. To increase the maize yield, local farmers use NPK fertilizer. However, the fertilization regime (CF) they practice is unbalanced with too much nitrogen in proportion to both phosphorus and potassium, which has led to low fertilizer use efficiency and excessive greenhouse gases emissions. A two-year field experiment was conducted to assess whether a high yielding but low greenhouse gases emission system could be developed by the combination of balanced fertilization (BF) and biochar amendment in a rainfed farmland located in the Northern region of China. Biochar was applied at rates of 0, 20, and 40 t/ha. Results show that BF and biochar increased maize yield and partial nutrient productivity and decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. Under BF the maize yield was 23.7% greater than under CF. N2O emissions under BF were less than half that under CF due to a reduced N fertilizer application rate. Biochar amendment decreased N2O by more than 31% under CF, while it had no effect on N2O emissions under BF. Thus BF was effective at maintaining a high maize yield and reducing greenhouse gases emissions. If combined with biochar amendment, BF would be a good way of sustaining low carbon agriculture in rainfed areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Emission algorithms, taking into account both nitrogen input and soil water content were established on the basis of the experimental data set. They allowed us to estimate annual nitrogen loss in the form of nitrous oxide modulated by rainfall. Production of methane is observed at the level of the water table under anoxic conditions. Nevertheless, the net flux between soil and atmosphere is negative for most of the time.

Earthworm-controlled CO2, N2O and N2 emissions from a silt loam soil amended with senescent litter of two energy crops (Silphium perfoliatum and Zea mays). AimsCup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) contributes to sustainable bioenergy production. However, little is known about the role of intensive litter fall and increased soil biodiversity on respiration and denitrification in its cultivation. This study aimed to assess CO2, N2O and N2 emissions of annual and perennial energy cropping systems affected by earthworms when supplied with senescent cup plant or maize litter.MethodsIn a 32-day laboratory incubation, the 15N gas flux method was applied in an N2-reduced atmosphere to a repacked silt loam soil, inoculated with Lumbricus terrestris L., and amended with senescent maize and cup plant litter. During incubation, CO2, N2O and N2 emissions were measured. After incubation, NO3-, NH4+, total C, and total N was analysed in soil and casts. Litter removal from the soil surface and net nitrification rates were calculated.ResultsEarthworms caused a fivefold increase in maize litter removal and a threefold increase regarding cup plant litter. Highest N2O + N2 fluxes were observed in treatments with earthworms and cup plant litter, although the high CN ratio of senescent cup plant litter implied higher N immobilisation than the CN ratio of senescent maize litter. Earthworms increased CO2, N2O, and especially N2 emissions lowering the product ratio of denitrification (N2Oi).ConclusionsEarthworm-controlled litter incorporation increased labile C from decomposition of recalcitrant litter as substrate for denitrification. Mineralisation patterns of senescent litter cannot be explained by CN ratio alone. The combination of both mechanisms affected denitrification, lead to elevated N2O and N2 emissions and N loss from the soil.

Plant growth-promoting bacteria have been used to mitigate N2O emissions by improving N use efficiency in plants. In addition, some of these microorganisms are capable of reducing N2O to N2, a process that could be further explored as a complementary mitigation strategy. This study aimed to test whether Azospirillum brasilense strains Ab-V5 and Ab-V6, and strain Wa3, as well as Nitrospirillum viridazoti strain BR 11145, already used in commercial inoculants for N-fertilized crops and known to carry the nosZ gene encoding nitrous oxide reductase, could act as biological sinks for this gas. In the pot experiment, soils fertilized with N and inoculated with N. viridazoti exhibited consistently lower N2O emissions, but not when A. brasilense strains were used. The mitigation effect was observed both in bare soil (72% emission reduction) and in the presence of millet plants (60% emission reduction), confirming the ability of N. viridazoti strain BR 11145 to consume N2O. In a field experiment conducted with maize, inoculation with N. viridazoti again reduced N2O fluxes during the first two weeks after fertilization compared with the urea-only treatment. However, no significant differences were detected comparing emission factors, whose calculation requires consideration of the entire monitoring period, thereby adding more variability. While N2O mitigation was observed, no significant effects of inoculation or N fertilization were found on maize growth or yield. Nonetheless, the consistent reduction in N2O emissions achieved with N. viridazoti strain BR 11145 suggests that inoculants with this bacterium represent a promising biological sink for N2O, offering a novel nature-based solution to enhance the sustainability of tropical crop management.

Fluxes of nitrous oxide from soil under different crop rotations and tillage systems in the South of Brazil. The zero tillage (ZT) system is used in a large area (> 24 Mha) of crop production in Brazil. This management system can contribute to soil C sequestration, but many studies in other countries have registered greater nitrous oxide emissions under ZT compared to conventional tillage (CT), which may reduce greenhouse gas mitigation benefits. The aim of this study was to estimate the emission of N2O from cropping systems under conventional and zero tillage in an 18-year-old experiment conducted on a Rhodic Ferralsol in the South of Brazil. Fluxes of N2O were measured over two years using static-closed chambers in the two tillage systems with three crop rotations. Soil water filled pore space (% WFPS) and soil mineral N were monitored along with rainfall and air temperature. Estimates of N2O emissions were obtained by integrating the fluxes with time and also by applying the IPCC direct emission factor (EF1 = 1%) to the amounts of N added as fertilisers and returned as crop residues. Fluxes of N2O were relatively low, apart from a short period at the beginning of measurements. No relationship between N2O fluxes and % WFPS or mineral N were observed. Nitrous oxide emissions were not influenced either by tillage system or crop rotation. For the crop rotation receiving high rates of N fertiliser in the second year, field-measured N2O emissions were significantly underestimated by the IPCC emission factor 1 (EF1). For the other treatments measured N2O emissions fell within the EF1 uncertainty range, but always considerably lower than the EF1 estimate, which suggests IPCC EF1 overestimates true N2O emissions for the Ferralsol under evaluation.

Impact of tillage and N fertilization rate on soil N2O emissions in irrigated maize in a Mediterranean agroecosystem. In irrigated Mediterranean conditions there is a lack of knowledge about the best combination of tillage and N fertilization practices to reduce soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions while maintaining maize productivity. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of different soil management practices and synthetic N fertilization rates on soil N2O emissions and their relationship with maize grain yield to determine the best management system to reduce yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSNE) in a semiarid area recently converted to irrigation under Mediterranean conditions. A long-term tillage and N rate field experiment established in 1996 under barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) rainfed conditions, was converted to irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) in 2015. After the transformation to irrigation, the field experiment maintained the same tillage treatments and N fertilization rates. Three types of tillage (conventional tillage, CT; reduced tillage, RT; no-tillage, NT) and three mineral N fertilization rates (0, 200, 400 kg N ha(-1)) were compared during three years (2015-2017) in a randomized block design with three replications. Soil N2O emissions, water-filled pore space, soil temperature, mineral N content (as NH4+ and NO3-), denitrification potential and maize grain yield and above-ground N uptake were quantified. Moreover, the emission factor (EF) and YSNE were calculated. The results showed that the combination of NT and the highest rate of N fertilization led to greater N2O emissions. Furthermore, the lowest N2O fluxes were observed in CT when WFPS was below 40% and the highest N2O fluxes were seen in NT when WFPS was above 60% coinciding with the greatest denitrification potential. Cumulative N2O emissions in 2017 and 2015 followed the order 400 > 200 > 0 kg N ha(-1), while in 2016, rate of 400 and 200 kg N ha(-1) showed greater cumulative N2O emission compared to the control. Only RT showed differences between growing seasons on cumulative N2O emissions, with greater values in 2017 compared to 2015, and intermediate values in 2016. In all treatments, the N2O EF was much lower than the default IPCC emission factor (1%). NT and RT increased the grain production compared to CT which was affected by severe soil crusting causing water deficit. Likewise, N fertilizer treatments significantly affected the YSNE, increasing with increasing fertilizer N application rate in the first year of study. Our data show that the use of NT or RT does not lead to more yield-scaled N2O emissions than CT in Mediterranean agroecosystems recently converted to irrigation.

Effects of Organic Maize Cropping Systems on Nitrogen Balances and Nitrous Oxide Emissions. Silage maize cultivation is gaining importance in organic farming, and thus its environmental and climate impacts. The effects of digestate fertilization in combination with different catch crops and tillage intensities in maize cultivation are investigated in a long-term field experiment in southern Germany. The tested variants are (a) maize after winter rye, plowed, unfertilized and (b) fertilized with biogas digestate, (c) maize after legume-rich cover crop mixture, mulch seeding, fertilized with digestate, and (d) maize in a white clover living mulch system, fertilized with digestate. Over three years (2019 to 2021), crop yields and N balance were analyzed, N2O emissions were measured in high temporal resolution using the closed chamber method, and soil moisture, ammonium, and nitrate contents were continuously determined. Maize dry matter yields ranged from 4.2 Mg ha(-1) (variant a, 2021) to 24.4 Mg ha(-1) (variant c, 2020) depending on cropping intensity and annual weather conditions. Despite relatively high nitrogen fertilization with digestate, the N balances were negative or nearly balanced; only in 2021 did the N surplus exceed 100 kg ha(-1) (variant b and c) due to low yields. In maize cultivation, relatively low N2O-N emissions (1.0 to 3.2 kg ha(-1)) were measured in the unfertilized variant (a), and very high emissions in variant b (5.6 to 19.0 kg ha(-1)). The sometimes extremely high N2O emissions are also due to soil and climatic conditions (high denitrification potential). The experimental results show that cover crops, living mulch, and reduced tillage intensity in silage maize cultivation can reduce N2O emissions, improve nitrogen balance and increase maize yields.

LIFE plus IPNOA mobile prototype for the monitoring of soil N2O emissions from arable crops: first-year results on durum wheat. Agricultural activities are co-responsible for the emission of the most important greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Development of methodologies to improve monitoring techniques for N2O are still needful. The LIFE-r-IPNOA project aims to improve the emissions monitoring of nitrous oxide from agricultural soils and to identify the agricultural practices that can limit N2O production. In order to achieve this objective, both a mobile and a stationary instrument were developed and validated. Several experimental field trials were set up in two different sites investigating the most representative crops of Tuscany (Central Italy). namely durum wheat, maize, sunflower, tomato and faba bean. The field trials were realized in order to test the effect on N2O emissions of key factors: tillage intensity, nitrogen fertiliser rate and irrigation. The field trial on durum wheat was set up in 2013 to test the effect of tillage intensity (minimum and conventional tillage) and nitrogen fertilisation rate (0, 110, 170 kg N ha (1)) on soil N2O flux. Monitoring was carried out using the IPNOA mobile prototype. Preliminary results on N2O emissions for the durum wheat growing season showed that mean daily NO fluxes ranged from -0.13 to 6.43 mg m (2) day (1) and cumulative N2O-N emissions over the period ranged from 827 to 2340 g N2O-N ha(-1). Tillage did not affect N2O flux while increasing nitrogen fertilisation rate resulted to significantly increase N2O emissions. The IPNOA mobile prototype performed well during this first year of monitoring, allowing to catch both very low fluxes and peaks on N2O emissions after nitrogen supply, showing a good suitability to the field conditions.

The Emissions of Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide during Winter without Cultivation in Local Saline-Alkali Rice and Maize Fields in Northeast China. Agricultural ecosystems are important contributors to atmospheric greenhouse gasses (GHGs); however, in situ winter emission data in saline-alkali fields are scarce. Gas samples were collected during different periods, from three rice (R1-R3) and three maize (M1-M3) fields with different soil pH levels and salinity conditions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the rice and maize fields decreased with decreasing temperature during the freezing period and increased with the rising temperature during the thawing period, with the majority of winter CO2 emissions occurring during these two periods. Peaks in methane (CH4) emissions were observed during the freezing period in the rice fields and during the snow-melting period in the rice and maize fields. CH4 emissions in the rice fields and CH4 uptake rates in the maize fields were significantly (P < 0.05) related to surface soil temperature. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remained relatively low, except for during the peaks observed during the snow-melting period in both the rice and maize fields, leading to the high GHG contribution of the snow-melting period throughout the winter. Higher pH and salinity conditions consistently resulted in lower CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, CH4 uptake, and lower global warming potential (GWP). These results can contribute to the assessment of the GWP during winter in saline-alkali regions.

Quantifying the effects of anaerobic soil disinfestation and other biological soil management strategies on nitrous oxide emissions from raised bed plasticulture tomato production. Soilborne pests are a major obstacle that must be overcome for the production of horticultural crops. Methyl bromide (MBr) was an effective preplanting soil broad-spectrum biocide, but its use has been banned due to its role in depleting the ozone layer. As a result, sustainable alternative methods for controlling soilborne pathogens and pests are needed. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are of concern in crop production due to the role of N2O as a greenhouse gas. Agricultural lands are known sources for emission of N2O into the atmosphere. Emissions are related to many environmental factors as well as fertilization and fumigation practices. This study evaluated the influence of different alternatives to MBr on N2O emissions throughout a tomato production season in two locations representative of southern and northern Florida. We evaluated eight soil management practices, including (a) untreated controls; (b) chemical soil fumigation; (c) anaerobic soil disinfestation using molasses (M) + composted poultry litter and (d and e) M + composted yard waste (CYW, at two rates); (f) Soil Symphony Amendment (SSA), a commercially available mix of microbes and nutrients; (g) CYW alone; and (h) CYW + SSA. Nitrous oxide emissions were measured throughout the cropping season. Emissions were highest on the day of planting (Day 21), ranging from 213 to 1,878 mu g m(-2) h(-1), likely due to the release of N2O that had accumulated under the totally impermeable film when it was punctured for planting. However, statistical significance varied between sites. Estimated cumulative emissions of N2O throughout the production season ranged from 1.3 to 4.8 kg N2O-N ha(-1).

Effects of plastic film mulching on soil greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) concentration within soil profiles in maize fields on the Loess Plateau, China. To better understand the effects of plastic film mulching on soil greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, we compared seasonal and vertical variations of GHG concentrations at seven soil depths in maize (Zea mays L.) fields at Changwu station in Shaanxi, a semi-humid region, between 2012 and 2013. Gas samples were taken simultaneously every one week from non-mulched (BP) and plastic film-mulched (FM) field plots. The results showed that the concentration of GHGs varied distinctly at the soil-atmosphere interface and in the soil profile during the maize growing season (MS). Both carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations increased with increasement of soil depth, while the methane (CH4) concentrations decreased with increasement of soil depth. A strong seasonal variation pattern was found for CO2 and N2O concentrations, as compared to an inconspicuous seasonal variation of CH4 concentrations. The mean CO2 and N2O concentrations were higher, but the mean CH4 concentration in the soil profiles was lower in the FM plots than in the BP plots. The results of this study suggested that plastic film mulching significantly increased the potential emissions of CO2 and N2O from the soil, and promoted CH4 absorption by the soil, particularly during the MS.

Crop residues and fertilizer nitrogen influence residue decomposition and nitrous oxide emission from a Vertisol. Crop residues with high C/N ratio immobilize N released during decomposition in soil, thus reducing N losses through leaching, denitrification, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted for 84 days under controlled conditions (24 degrees C and moisture content 55% of water-holding capacity) to study the influence of sugarcane, maize, sorghum, cotton and lucerne residues, and mineral N addition, on N mineralization immobilization and N2O emission. Residues were added at the rate of 3 t C ha(-1) to soil with, and without, 150 kg urea N ha(-1). The addition of sugarcane, maize, and sorghum residues without N fertilizer resulted in a significant immobilization of soil N. Amended soil had significantly (P<0.05) lower NO3--N, which reached minimum values of 2.8 mg N kg(-1) for sugarcane (at day 28), 10.3 mg N kg(-1) for maize (day 7), and 5.9 mg N kg(-1) for sorghum (day 7), compared to 22.7 mg N kg(-1) for the unamended soil (day 7). During 84 days of incubation, the total mineral N in the residues+N treatments were decreased by 45 mg N kg(-1) in sugarcane, 34 mg kg(-1) in maize, 29 mg kg(-1) in sorghum, and 16 mg kg(-1) in cotton amended soil compared to soil+N fertilizer, although soil NO3--N increased by 7 mg kg(-1) in lucerne amended soil. The addition of residues also significantly increased amended soil microbial biomass C and N. Maximum emissions of N2O from crop residue amended soils occurred in the first 4-5 days of incubation. Overall, after 84 days of incubation, the cumulative N2O emission was 25% lower with cotton+N fertilizer, compared to soil+N fertilizer. The cumulative N2O emission was significantly and positively correlated with NO3--N (r=0.92, P < 0.01) and total mineral N (r=0.93, P<0.01) after 84 days of incubation, and had a weak but significant positive correlation with cumulative CO2 in the first 3 and 5 days of incubation (r=0.59, P< 0.05).

A global meta-analysis of yield-scaled N2O emissions and its mitigation efforts for maize, wheat, and rice. Maintaining or even increasing crop yields while reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is necessary to reconcile food security and climate change, while the metric of yield-scaled N2O emission (i.e., N2O emissions per unit of crop yield) is at present poorly understood. Here we conducted a global meta-analysis with more than 6000 observations to explore the variation patterns and controlling factors of yield-scaled N2O emissions for maize, wheat and rice and associated potential mitigation options. Our results showed that the average yield-scaled N2O emissions across all available data followed the order wheat (322 g N Mg-1, with the 95% confidence interval [CI]: 301-346) > maize (211 g N Mg-1, CI: 198-225) > rice (153 g N Mg-1, CI: 144-163). Yield-scaled N2O emissions for individual crops were generally higher in tropical or subtropical zones than in temperate zones, and also showed a trend towards lower intensities from low to high latitudes. This global variation was better explained by climatic and edaphic factors than by N fertilizer management, while their combined effect predicted more than 70% of the variance. Furthermore, our analysis showed a significant decrease in yield-scaled N2O emissions with increasing N use efficiency or in N2O emissions for production systems with cereal yields >10 Mg ha(-1) (maize), 6.6 Mg ha(-1) (wheat) or 6.8 Mg ha(-1) (rice), respectively. This highlights that N use efficiency indicators can be used as valuable proxies for reconciling trade-offs between crop production and N2O mitigation. For all three major staple crops, reducing N fertilization by up to 30%, optimizing the timing and placement of fertilizer application or using enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers significantly reduced yield-scaled N2O emissions at similar or even higher cereal yields. Our data-driven assessment provides some key guidance for developing effective and targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies for the sustainable intensification of cereal production.

Soil-land-use-system approach to estimate nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from agricultural soils contribute significantly to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. Numerous studies have been conducted during the last three decades to improve the understanding of the processes involved in the release of N2O from agricultural soils. This enabled the creation of process based models on site and field scale. In addition, a growing number of N2O emission data are available for different soil-land-use-systems from various climates. The integration of these data in global and national N2O budgets leads to more improved estimations. Surprisingly, N2O-emission calculations are rare on regional meso and macro scales. The spatial identification of areas with a high efflux of N2O on regional meso and macro scales is essential for the implementation of N2O emission mitigation strategies, thus leading to an increased sustainability of land use. On the basis of the ecosystem approach of Matson and Vitousek (1990), we introduce a new method to estimate regional N2O emissions from agricultural soils on meso and macro scales. This method considers spatial environmental information from available spatial and statistical data as well as quantitative and qualitative expertise by using the tools of a geographic information system (GIS). An environmental information system (EIS) was built up for a dairy farm region in Southern Germany which includes soil, land use, topography, N2O emission and farm management data. Using all information in the EIS, it was possible (i) to identify different spatial soil-land-use-systems, (ii) to link emission data and process knowledge to these soil-land-use-systems and (iii) to visualize spatial emission potentials. On this basis, N2O emission potentials for each of the communities in the study region and the whole region were estimated. The estimated annual N2O emission potential from agricultural soils for the examined dairy farm region in Southern Germany covering around 775 km(2) is about 3.0 kg N2O-N ha(-1).

The effects of controlled release urea on maize productivity and reactive nitrogen losses: A meta-analysis. Application of controlled release urea (CRU) is recommended to reduce the undesirable environmental effects resulting from urea application. However, the overall effects of CRU on maize productivity and reactive nitrogen (N) losses remain unclear. Our global meta-analysis based on 866 observations of 120 studies indicated that application of CRU instead of urea (same N rate) increased maize yield by 5.3% and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by 24.1%, and significantly decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, N leaching and ammonia (NH3) volatilization by 23.8%, 27.1% and 39.4%, respectively. The increase of NUE and reduction of N2O emission by CRU application were greater with medium and high N rates (150 <= N < 200 and N >= 200 kg N ha(-1)) than with low N rates. The reduction in N2O emission and N leaching with CRU application were enhanced when soil organic carbon (SOC) content was <15.0 g kg(-1), and soil texture was medium or coarse. The reduction in N2O emission and NH3 volatilization with CRU were greater in soils with pH >= 6.0. We concluded that use of CRU should be encouraged for maize production, especially on light-textured soils with low organic matter content. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide in two Tanzanian croplands: Effects of nitrogen and stover management. Cropland intensification is needed to meet the demand for food in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This process requires a dramatic increase in resource inputs, including fertilizer-nitrogen (N) and organic residues (e.g., stover), which alter the soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O). The dearth of N2O emission data for SSA croplands, however, limits our ability to define regional and global N2O flux and mitigation opportunities. In two soils planted with maize in Tanzania (Iringa, sandy Alfisols; Mbeya, clayey Andisols), we conducted year-round measurements for 2 consecutive years to quantify N2O emissions in response to increasing N rates and in combination with maize stover incorporation. Rainfall and the resulting soil moisture, rather than soil temperature, were important environmental drivers of N2O emissions in these fields. Applied N stimulated N2O fluxes across soil types but with different magnitudes-lower in Iringa because of the dominance of nitrification in N2O production and higher in Mbeya likely from promoted denitrification when the water-filled pore space was > 47%. N2O emission increased exponentially or linearly with N rate, depending on the year. The direct N2O emission factors were well below the 1% of the IPCC Tier 1 method, ranging from 0.13% to 0.26% in Iringa and from 0.24% to 0.42% in Mbeya, for a N rate of 50-150 kg N ha(-1) during the study. Compared with N application alone, stover plus N did not significantly alter maize yield, but did raise N2O emissions significantly (P <= 0.06). Consequently, stover incorporation markedly increased the emission factor (up to 0.46% in Iringa and 1.29% in Mbeya) as well as yield-scaled N2O emissions. Our results suggest that linear and exponential emission responses can occur in SSA croplands and challenge the promotion of combining stover with fertilizer N as resource input management in this region.

Effects of fertiliser type and the presence or absence of plants on nitrous oxide emissions from irrigated soils. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and denitrification losses from an irrigated sandy loam soil amended with composted municipal solid waste (MSW), sheep manure (SM), surface applied pig slurry (SPS), incorporated pig slurry (IPS) or urea (U) were studied under Mediterranean conditions. We quantified emissions, in both the presence and absence of maize and N2O production, via denitrification and nitrification pathways using varying concentrations of acetylene. Discounting the N2O lost in the Control, the percentages of N2O lost in relation to the total N applied were greater for urea (1.80%) than for MSW (0.50%), SM (0.46%), SPS (1.02%) or IPS (1.27%). In general, plots treated with organic fertilisers emitted higher amounts of N2O when under maize than bare soil plots. On the other hand, greater denitrification losses were also recorded for plots in the absence of plants (between 9.7 and 29.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) than for areas with plants (between 7.1 and 24.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1)). The proportion of N2O produced via denitrification was greater from fertiliser treatments than for the controls and also greater without plants (between 66 and 91 % of the N2O emitted) than with plants (between 48 and 81%).

Contribution to N2O emissions and N fate of crop residues and synthetic N fertilizer in a cover crop-maize rotation: A 15N-tracing study. Background and aims Crop residue retention and cover cropping are key strategies in conservation agriculture, but their effects on nitrogen (N) cycling and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, particularly in semiarid croplands, remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the N dynamics and N2O sources in an irrigated cover crop-maize rotation in central Spain by conducting a N-15 tracing experiment. Methods N-15-labeled maize (Zea mays L.) residues were incorporated into the soil, followed by vetch (Vicia faba L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cover crops, or bare fallow. A subsequent maize crop was fertilized with 210 kg N ha(-1) as ammonium nitrate (AN) or N-15-labeled AN ((NH4NO3)-N-15, (15)AN//(NH4NO3)-N-15, A(15)N) in the microplots receiving N-15-enriched or unlabeled maize residues, respectively. Results Cumulative N2O emissions were 47% higher under vetch than under barley. Average N2O emission factors were 0.05% for N-15-labeled residues and 0.23% for fertilizer. Most N2O originated from (15)AN (42%-61%), followed by endogenous sources (i.e., mineralization of organic N from soil or crop residues, 19%-42%) and A(15)N (9%-18%). Maize recovered 7.7% of residue N, with no differences between cover cropping treatments. Plant uptake from A(15)N was 2.3 times higher than from (15)AN. Across barley, vetch, and fallow, total N recovery averaged 33% in plants and 22% in soil. Barley cover cropping improved fertilizer N recovery in maize by 57% (P < 0.05) compared with fallow. Conclusion These findings highlight the role of cereal cover crops and the regulation of ammonium oxidation-based processes in enhancing N use efficiency and reducing fertilizer-derived N2O emissions in semiarid agro-ecosystems.

Effects of nitrification inhibitors (DCD and DMPP) on nitrous oxide emission, crop yield and nitrogen uptake in a wheat-maize cropping system. The application of nitrification inhibitors together with ammonium-based fertilizers is proposed as a potent method to decrease nitrous oxide (N2O) emission while promoting crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency in fertilized agricultural fields. To evaluate the effects of nitrification inhibitors, we conducted year-round measurements of N2O fluxes, yield, aboveground biomass, plant carbon and nitrogen contents, soil inorganic nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon contents and the main environmental factors for urea (U), urea + dicyandiamide (DCD) and urea +3,4-dimethylpyrazol phosphate (DMPP) treatments in a wheat-maize rotation field. The cumulative N2O emissions were calculated to be 4.49 +/- 0.21, 2.93 +/- 0.06 and 2.78 +/- 0.16 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the U, DCD and DMPP treatments, respectively. Therefore, the DCD and DMPP treatments significantly decreased the annual emissions by 35% and 38 %, respectively (p < 0.01). The variations of soil temperature, moisture and inorganic nitrogen content regulated the seasonal fluctuation of N2O emissions. When the emissions presented clearly temporal variations, high-frequency measurements or optimized sampling schedule for intermittent measurements would likely provide more accurate estimations of annual cumulative emission and treatment effect. The application of nitrification inhibitors significantly increased the soil inorganic nitrogen content (p < 0.01); shifted the main soil inorganic nitrogen form from nitrate to ammonium; and tended to increase the dissolved organic carbon content, crop yield, aboveground biomass and nitrogen uptake by aboveground plant. The results demonstrate the roles the nitrification inhibitors play in enhancing yield and nitrogen use efficiency and reducing N2O emission from the wheat-maize cropping system.

Nitrous oxide emissions in Midwest US maize production vary widely with band-injected N fertilizer rates, timing and nitrapyrin presence. Nitrification inhibitors have the potential to reduce N2O emissions from maize fields, but optimal results may depend on deployment of integrated N fertilizer management systems that increase yields achieved per unit of N2O lost. A new micro-encapsulated formulation of nitrapyrin for liquid N fertilizers became available to US farmers in 2010. Our research objectives were to (i) assess the impacts of urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) management practices (timing, rate and nitrification inhibitor) and environmental variables on growing-season N2O fluxes and (ii) identify UAN treatment combinations that both reduce N2O emissions and optimize maize productivity. Field experiments near West Lafayette, Indiana in 2010 and 2011 examined three N rates (0, 90 and 180 kg N ha(-1)), two timings (pre-emergence and side-dress) and presence or absence of nitrapyrin. Mean cumulative N2O-N emissions (Q(10) corrected) were 0.81, 1.83 and 3.52 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the rates of 0, 90 and 180 kg N ha(-1), respectively; 1.80 and 2.31 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for pre-emergence and side-dress timings, respectively; and 1.77 versus 2.34 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for with and without nitrapyrin, respectively. Yield-scaled N2O-N emissions increased with N rates as anticipated (averaging 167, 204 and 328 g N2O-N Mg grain(-1) for the 0, 90 and 180 kg N ha(-1) rates), but were 22% greater with the side-dress timing than the pre-emergence timing (when averaged across N rates and inhibitor treatments) because of environmental conditions following later applications. Overall yield-scaled N2O-N emissions were 22% lower with nitrapyrin than without the inhibitor, but these did not interact with N rate or timing.

Quantifying changes to the global warming potential of rice wheat systems with the adoption of conservation agriculture in northwestern India. Field trials were conducted in Haryana representing the northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) to assess the changes brought about by management, including conservation agriculture (CA) practices, in the global warming potential (GWP) of conventional rice-wheat systems. Conservation agriculture is an approach to managing agro-ecosystems for improved and sustained productivity, by way of minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with organic matter or cover crops and crop rotation. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured using static chambers. Experiments involved four cropping system scenarios with different CA components, and different N rates. In addition, emissions of CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured in farmers' fields to establish baselines. The dynamics of CH4 emissions were controlled by floodwater levels, and fertilizer N had no effect. On the other hand, N application rates and timing in relation to soil water status determined the N2O emissions in rice fields. Nitrous oxide fluxes could be avoided by applying N fertilizer to wet soil or by irrigating the field not later than 1 day after N application. Applying crop residues on soil surface had no significant effect on the seasonal CH4 and N2O emissions. It was estimated that switching rice crop establishment method from conventional to CA-based practices in Haryana could reduce GWP for rice by 23% or by 1.26 Tg CO2 eq yr(-1). An intensive CA-based rice-wheat and maize-wheat system reduced GWP by 16-26% or by 1.3-2.0 Tg CO2 eq yr(-1) compared with the conventional rice-wheat system. However, this reduction in GWP would be from a decrease in diesel and electricity consumption and not from direct emissions of CH4 and N2O, which were higher in the maize-wheat system than in the rice-wheat system.

Hydrochar from dairy sludge as phosphorus fertiliser affects greenhouse gas emissions and maize yield. Dairy processing sludge is a phosphorus (P) rich waste with a high potential to replace mineral phosphorus fertiliser in crop production, with possible enhancement of greenhouse gas emissions to the environment. Hydrothermal carbonisation is a technology that transforms the sludge into a hydrochar. The objective of this study is examining P availability of two hydrochars produced from Danish and Irish dairy sludge and their influence on greenhouse gas emissions and maize yields. The trial assessed (i) Danish dairy sludge; (ii) hydrochar derived from Danish sludge; (iii) hydrochar made from Irish dairy sludge; (iv) mineral phosphorus fertiliser; and (v) control. Emissions of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, soil pH, mineral nitrogen contents and crop yields were measured. Treatment with Danish dairy sludge had significantly higher cumulative nitrous oxide emissions while the emissions from both hydrochars were not significantly different compared to mineral phosphorous feriliser. Statistical modelling showed that temperature, soil nitrate content, interactions both between temperature and precipitation, and between soil moisture and precipitation were drivers for nitrous oxide emissions. There was no difference in emissions among all treatments when scaled for yield. Hydrochar may alleviate the enhanced nitrous oxide emissions in soil without constraining P availability and maize crop yields.

Spatial-heterogeneous granulation of organic amendments and chemical fertilizer stimulated N2O emissions from agricultural soil: An microcosm study. The promising application modes of organic fertilizer (OF) and chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer (CF) could be the homogeneous granulation (HG: OF and CF are distributed spatially evenly) and spatial heterogeneous granulation (SG: OF and CF are distributed separately in space), where the N transformation processes, such as the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, are greatly influenced by the spatial distribution of the OF and CF, particularly. Currently, there is a lack of in-depth understanding about the microbial mechanisms of the SG and HG application on N2O emissions, and the related functional guilds (ammonia oxidizers and heterotrophic denitrifiers) respond to the granular fertilizer is yet not known. In the present study, we made CF (N-15-(NH4)(2)SO4), cow compost and maize straw (2% or 8% based on the N proportion) into granular of 1 cm in diameter, in HG and SG forms, respectively, and then applied these granules in soils for 80 days incubation. Results showed that, compared with HG treatments, the SG treatment promoted the ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) intensities, and increased the N2O emissions possibly through ammonia oxidize bacteria dependent nitrification and fungal denitrification. In addition, the high maize residues proportion in organic fertilizer significantly mitigated N2O emissions by the coupled impacts of suppressed nitrification and enhanced denitrification enzyme activity with high C input. Overall, our results suggest that spatial heterogeneous granulation of and CF may induce higher risk of N2O emissions and the higher proportion of maize residues could potentially mitigate such increased emissions.

Impacts of Legacy and Contemporary Nitrogen Inputs on N2O and CO2 Emissions in Miscanthus and Maize Cultivated Soils. Nutrient inputs influence the sustainability of bioenergy crop production through contemporary (shortly after addition) and legacy effects (persisting over years) on microbial nitrogen (N) and carbon cycling, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. However, the relative importance of contemporary and legacy effects and how that could vary by crop functional types is poorly understood. Considering its rhizomatous roots and perennial growth, we hypothesized that Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) would be more sensitive to legacy N fertilization and the historical context of its environment than an annual crop like maize. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of legacy and contemporary N inputs on nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as well as key N cycling genes in soils where Mxg and maize were grown. A 150-day soil incubation experiment was conducted using soils from a long-term Mxg and maize fertility experiment with three historic N fertilization rates (0, 112, and 336 kg N ha-1 year-1) and a contemporary amendment (60 mg N kg-1) with negative control (0 mg N kg-1). We observed significant increases in cumulative N2O emissions in Mxg soils relative to maize soils, particularly at higher legacy fertilization rates, while contemporary N had no significant effect. Bacterial amoA gene abundance, which plays a significant role in nitrification in nutrient-rich soils, also increased with higher legacy fertilization rates in Mxg soils but was unaffected by the contemporary N. In maize soils, legacy and contemporary N did not significantly affect N2O emissions, but cumulative CO2 emissions and amoA gene abundance significantly increased. The abundances of norB genes were not significantly influenced by either legacy fertilization or contemporary N amendments in either soil. Our findings demonstrate the greater importance of fertilization history over contemporary N in mediating soil N2O emissions, particularly for perennial bioenergy crops.

Soil-derived trace gas fluxes from different energy crops - results from a field experiment in Southwest Germany. Willow coppice, energy maize and Miscanthus were evaluated regarding their soil-derived trace gas emission potential involving a nonfertilized and a crop-adapted slow-release nitrogen (N) fertilizer scheme. The N application rate was 80 kg N ha-1 yr-1 for the perennial crops and 240 kg N ha-1 yr-1 for the annual maize. A replicated field experiment was conducted with 1-year measurements of soil fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O in weekly intervals using static chambers. The measurements revealed a clear seasonal trend in soil CO2 emissions, with highest emissions being found for the N-fertilized Miscanthus plots (annual mean: 50 mg C m-(2) h-1). Significant differences between the cropping systems were found in soil N2O emissions due to their dependency on amount and timing of N fertilization. N-fertilized maize plots had highest N2O emissions by far, which accumulated to 3.6 kg N2O ha-1 yr-1. The contribution of CH4 fluxes to the total soil greenhouse gas subsumption was very small compared with N2O and CO2. CH4 fluxes were mostly negative indicating that the investigated soils mainly acted as weak sinks for atmospheric CH4. To identify the system providing the best ratio of yield to soil N2O emissions, a subsumption relative to biomass yields was calculated. N-fertilized maize caused the highest soil N2O emissions relative to dry matter yields. Moreover, unfertilized maize had higher relative soil N2O emissions than unfertilized Miscanthus and willow. These results favour perennial crops for bioenergy production, as they are able to provide high yields with low N2O emissions in the field.

Nitrite intensity explains N management effects on N2O emissions in maize. It is typically assumed that the dependence of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions on soil nitrogen (N) availability is best quantified in terms of ammonium (NH4+) and/or nitrate (NO3-) concentrations. In contrast, nitrite (NO2-) is seldom measured separately from NO3- despite its role as a central substrate in N2O production. We examined the effects of three N fertilizer sources and two placement methods on N2O and N dynamics in maize over two growing seasons. Cumulative N2O emissions were well-correlated with NO2- intensity (NO21) but not with NO3- (NO3I) or NH4+ (NH4I) intensity. By itself, NO21 explained more than 44% of the overall variance in N2O. Treatment effects on N2O and NO21 were similar. When conventional urea (U) was applied using mid-row banding (MRB), both N2O and NO21 increased by a factor of about 2 compared to broadcast/incorporated (BI). When polymer-coated urea (PCU) was the N source, MRB placement increased both N2O and NO21 compared to BI only in the wetter of the two years. When urea with microbial inhibitors (IU) was the N source, N2O and NO21 were lowest across both years and were less affected by placement than U or PCU. A 50/50 mix of IU and U reduced N2O and NO21 compared to U alone, suggesting that a mixed N source may provide an economical N2O mitigation strategy. Our results show that practices which reduce NO accumulation have the potential to also reduce N2O emissions, and that separate consideration of NO3- and NO dynamics can provide more insight than their combined dynamics as typically quantified.

Residue incorporation depth is a controlling factor of earthworm-induced nitrous oxide emissions. Earthworms can increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, particularly in no-tillage systems where earthworms are abundant. Here, we study the effect of residue incorporation depth on earthworm-induced N2O emissions. We hypothesized that cumulative N2O emissions decrease with residue incorporation depth, because (i) increased water filled pore space (WFPS) in deeper soil layers leads to higher denitrification rates as well as more complete denitrification; and (ii) the longer upward diffusion path increases N2O reduction to N2. Two 84-day laboratory mesocosm experiments were conducted. First, we manually incorporated maize (Zea mays L.) residue at different soil depths (incorporation experiment). Second, 13C-enriched maize residue was applied to the soil surface and anecic species Lumbricus terrestris (L.) and epigeic species Lumbricus rubellus (Hoffmeister) were confined to different soil depths (earthworm experiment). Residue incorporation depth affected cumulative N2O emissions in both experiments (P similar to<similar to 0.001). In the incorporation experiment, N2O emissions decreased from 4.91 similar to mg similar to N2ON similar to kg-1 soil (surface application) to 2.71 similar to mg similar to N2ON similar to kg-1 soil (4050 similar to cm incorporation). In the earthworm experiment, N2O emissions from L. terrestris decreased from 3.87 similar to mg similar to N2ON similar to kg-1 soil (confined to 010 similar to cm) to 2.01 similar to mg similar to N2ON similar to kg-1 soil (confined to 030 similar to cm). Both experimental setups resulted in dissimilar WFPS profiles that affected N2O dynamics. We also found significant differences in residue C recovery in soil organic matter between L. terrestris (2841%) and L. rubellus (56%). We conclude that (i) N2O emissions decrease with residue incorporation depth, although this effect was complicated by dissimilar WFPS profiles; and (ii) larger residue C incorporation by L. rubellus than L. terrestris indicates that earthworm species differ in their C stabilization potential. Our findings underline the importance of studying earthworm diversity in the context of greenhouse gas emissions from agro-ecosystems.

Assessment of Greenhouse Gases Emission in Maize-Wheat Cropping System Under Varied N Fertilizer Application Using Cool Farm Tool. In recent decades, climate change induced by enhanced global warming is one of the biggest challenges at the global level. Agriculture sectors significantly contribute to total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission to the atmosphere. Wheat and maize, cultivated globally, and consumed in different forms, are considered as crucial staple cereal for ensuring food security to global population. The management practices involving land preparation, sowing, fertilizer application, irrigation, pest management, etc. significantly influence the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from agricultural soil. In this study, CO2 and N2O emission were assessed from maize and wheat crops at four different levels of N fertilizer using cool farm tool model. Emissions of CO2 per hectare varied from 331.4 to 1,088.3 kgCO(2) in maize and ranged from 292.3 to 765.3 kgCO(2) in wheat on application of different doses of N. The total GHG emission in maize crops ranged from 859.5 to 3,003.4 kgCO(2) eq per hectare with the application of nitrogen at varying levels (0-240 kg N per hectare). The highest N2O efflux (0.368 kg per ton) was observed at 240 kg N per hectare under wheat crop. The total on-farm emissions, through fertilizer production, account for about 33.7%, and emission of N2O contributes only 65.9%, whereas pesticides account merely 0.4% under maize-wheat cropping. This study confirms that the direct emission of N2O was totally dependent on N fertilizers application rate; however, the indirect emission was controlled by the fuels and energy consumption.</p> C1 [Kumar, Rakesh; Minz, Asisan; Kumar, Arvind] Birsa Agr Univ, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Ranchi, Bihar, India.

While the effect of removing plant material is relatively well understood, the effect of different incorporation methods and the inoculation of cover crops with microbial inoculant (MI) is still poorly known. To investigate these effects, we conducted an incubation study and a field trial where a grass-clover cover crop was followed by maize. We measured greenhouse gas emissions (N2O, CO2), soil parameters (Nmin, DOC, soil moisture and temperature), soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and maize yield. In the four weeks following cover crop incorporation, shallow rotary tillage induced 30 % higher CO2 emissions than ploughing and removal of cover crop biomass resulted in significantly lower N2O and CO2 emissions as if it was mulched and inoculated with MI. Regarding the whole season, removal of aboveground cover crop biomass reduced N2O field emissions in tendency by 21 %, whereby the trend in N2O reduction by adding MI in the field was less pronounced. Total N2O emissions did not differ between tillage implements used for incorporation. SOC stocks did not change within 0-20 cm within a year. Maize yield was 23 % higher with ploughing than rotary tillage. Overall, the addition of MI during cover crop incorporation might improve the greenhouse gas balance, but potential effects are superimposed too strongly by other management and meteorological factors. Therefore, claims that MI are an option to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture remain weakly substantiated.

Effects of different biochars and digestate on N2O fluxes under field conditions. Field studies that have investigated the effects of char materials on the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) are still scarce. Therefore, we conducted a field trial with bio- and hydrochars and measured N2O emissions for one whole year. It was hypothesised that the incorporation of chars reduces the emissions of N2O. Chars were produced by pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) using either maize silage or wood residues as feedstock. In addition, after production chars were post-treated with digestate in order to accelerate the ageing process of the chars. Chars and digestate were applied to the soil to raise the C content. Emissions of N2O were measured weekly and soil samples for inorganic nitrogen (N) and soil water-content were taken once a month. Additionally, the abundance of functional marker genes from denitrification (nosZ) was determined in October 2012 and in June 2013. The treatment with pure digestate emitted the most N2O compared to the control and char treatments. However, this was significant only in one case. There were no great differences between the char treatments due to high spatial variability and gene abundance of nosZ did not differ between treatments. Overall, emissions of N2O were relatively low. This was attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of the chars and the sandy soils that did not favour the production of N2O. To conclude, the emissions of N2O were mainly influenced by temperature and precipitation and to a minor extent by the type of char and post-treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Agronomic Practices vs. Climate Factors: A Meta-Analysis of Influences on Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Corn and Soybean Fields. Nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and major contributor to climate change, is primarily released through agricultural activities. To better understand and quantify how land management practices, local climate conditions, and soil physicochemical properties affect these agricultural N2O emissions, we conducted a review of the peer-reviewed literature on N2O emission from corn [Zea mays L.] and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] fields. We evaluated the seasonal, cumulative effects of three nitrogen fertilizer rates-no fertilizer (0), low (<188 kg N ha(-1)), and high (188-400 kg N ha(-1))-tillage practices, local climate (precipitation and temperature), soil texture, and soil pH on soil N2O emissions. This meta-analysis included 77 articles for corn and 22 articles for soybean fields. Average N2O emissions during the corn rotation were 2.34 and 2.45 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1) under low and high N fertilizer rates, respectively, and were both substantially (p < 0.0001) greater than those of non-fertilized corn fields (0.91 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1)). Non-fertilized soybean fields showed seasonal N2O emissions of 0.74 kg N2O-N ha(-1), while low fertilizer application triggered a sharp increase (1.87 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) in N2O emissions by roughly 2.5 times (p < 0.028). Increased temperature did not significantly (p > 0.05) affect the emission of N2O from fertilized or non-fertilized corn fields. Regardless of fertilization and tillage practices, our analysis, including Principal Component Analysis, revealed that in corn fields, precipitation and soil pH are the dominant factors influencing soil N2O emissions. This study uniquely quantifies the influence of climate-soil factors, such as precipitation and soil pH, alongside agronomic practices, on N2O emissions, offering new insights beyond previous reviews focused primarily on fertilizer rates or tillage effects.

In-season split nitrogen application and cover cropping effects on nitrous oxide emissions in rainfed maize. Cover crops and in-season nitrogen (N) management are promoted as key conservation practices for reducing nitrate leaching losses from agricultural fields. However, their combined effects on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions per unit of crop productivity remains uncertain. These practices might contribute to high N2O emissions by providing N and C substrates for microbial denitrification activity, especially when in-season N application coincides with cover crop decomposition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of N application timing and cereal rye (CR, Secale cereale L) cover crops on area-and yield-scaled soil N2O emissions in continuous maize (Zea mays L.) over 3-yr (2018-2020). Treatments were: Pre-Season-N: 224 kg N ha-1 split applied in fall + pre-plant in 2018, or as single pre-plant applications in 2019 and 2020; In-Season-N: pre-plant + side-dress (growth stage V6-V7); In-Season-N + CR: ; and a zero N plot as the Control. We found that shifting from pre-season to in-season split N application did not significantly affect area-or yield-scaled N2O emissions in any year. Despite high N2O spikes for the In-Season-N + CR following side-dress N application in all years, this did not translate to consistently higher cumulative N2O emissions. Compared with Pre-Season-N and In-Season N, In-Season-N + CR significantly increased area-and yield-scaled N2O emissions by approximately 50% in 1 of 3 years. These results suggest the combination of high soil N supply, warm and wet soil conditions, and cover crop decomposition contributes to elevated N2O emissions, but the cumulative effects of side-dress N application with a CR cover crop are variable across years. With increasing adoption of these practices to reduce nitrate leaching losses from croplands, future work should simultaneously assess effects on N2O emissions and crop yield to account for potential tradeoffs in N loss pathways.

Effect of Stover Management and Nitrogen Fertilization on N2O and CO2 Emissions from Irrigated Maize in a High Nitrate Mediterranean Soil. A high soil nitrogen (N) content in irrigated areas quite often results in environmental problems. Improving the management practices of intensive agriculture can mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study compared the effect of maize stover incorporation or removal together with different mineral N fertilizer rates (0, 200 and 300 kg N ha(-1)) on the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) on a sprinkler-irrigated maize (Zea mays L.). The trail was conducted in the Ebro Valley (NE Spain) in a high nitrate-N soil (i.e. 200 g NO3-N kg(-1)). Nitrous oxide and CO2 emissions were sampled weekly using a semistatic closed chamber and quantified using the photoacoustic technique in 2011 and 2012. Applying sidedress N fertilizer tended to increase N2O emissions whereas stover incorporation did not have any clear effect. Nitrification was probably the main process leading to N2O. Denitrification was limited by the low soil moisture content (WFPS < 54%), due to an adequate irrigation management. Emissions ranged from -0.11 to 0.36% of the N applied, below the IPCC (2007) values. Nitrogen fertilization tended to reduce CO2 emission, but only in 2011. Stover incorporation increased CO2 emission. Nitrogen use efficiency decreased with increasing mineral fertilizer supply. The application of N in high N soils of the Ebro Valley is not necessary until the soil restores a normal mineral N content, regardless of stover management. This will combine productivity with keeping N2O and CO2 emissions under control provided irrigation is adequately managed. Testing soil NO3--N contents before fertilizing would improve N fertilizer recommendations. C1 [Maris, S. C.; Teira-Esmatges, M.

Applying green manure and zeolite and reducing N fertilization in maize mitigates N2O emission while maintaining yield. Green manure is widely employed to substitute chemical N fertilizer. However, the potential of further alleviating N2O emission when combined with efficient management technologies has not been fully explored. To reduce this research gap, a 2-year field experiment was conducted in northwestern China. The aim was to investigate the impact of zeolite application on N2O emission in the maize-common vetch intercropping system under 30% N reduction, as well as the possible mechanisms. The experiment included two cropping systems, namely monoculture maize and maize-common vetch intercropping, along with three amendment practices, namely conventional N, 70% conventional N, and zeolite application under 70% conventional N. Compared with monoculture maize under conventional N, maize-green manure intercropping combined with zeolite application under 70% chemical N achieved comparable yields. Simultaneously, this practice reduced cumulative N2O and yield-scaled N2O emissions by 36.9% and 39.2%, respectively. This reduction can be attributed to a decrease in soil ammonium-N by 20.9%-57.7%, nitrate-N by 47.7%-51.3%, nitrate reductase activities by 25.3%-34.4% and N2O-producer (i.e., nirS and nirK) abundance by 17.3%-79.4% in denitrification, and an increase in the N2O-reducer (i.e., nosZ) abundance by 40.0%-103.4%. Compared with 100% N input, 70% chemical N treatment reduced ammonium-N by 22.3%-41.0%, nitrate-N by 25.4%-41.0%, and N2O-producer abundance by 17.1%-35.0% in denitrification. Zeolite application reduced denitrifying enzyme activities by 8.2%-12.9%, N2O-producer abundance by 42.5%-56.4%, but increased N2O-reducer abundance by 13.3%-23.3% in denitrification. PLS-PM analysis showed that N2O emission mitigation was mainly related to reduced soil ammonium-N and nitrate-N, decreased N2O-producer abundance, and increased N2O-reducer abundance in denitrification. These findings provide new insights into the fact that intercropping green manure combined with zeolite application effectively mitigates N2O emission by regulating mineral N, N-cycling enzymes, and denitrifier abundances while maintaining maize yield after cutting 30% N input.

Maize-Brachiaria intercropping: A strategy to supply recycled N to maize and reduce soil N2O emissions?. Nitrogen use in agriculture directly impacts food security, global warming, and environmental degradation. Forage grasses intercropped with maize produce feed for animals and or mulch for no-till systems. Forage grasses may exude nitrification inhibitors. It was hypothesized that brachiaria intercropping increases N recycling and maize grain yield and reduces nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil under maize cropping. A field experiment was set up in December 2016 to test three cropping system (maize monocropped, maize intercropped with Brachiaria brizantha or with B. humidicola) and two N rates (0 or 150 kg ha-1). The grasses were sown with maize, but B. humidicola did not germinate well in the first year. B. brizantha developed slowly during the maize cycle because of shading but expanded after maize was harvested. The experiment was repeated in 2017/2018 when B. humidicola was replanted. N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, maize grain yield and N content were measured during the two seasons. After the first maize harvest, the above- and below-ground biomass, C and N content of B. brizantha grown during fall-winter, and the biological nitrification inhibition potential of B. brizantha were evaluated. Maize yield responded to N fertilization (5.1 vs. 9.8 t ha-1) but not to brachiaria intercropping. B. brizantha recycled approximately 140 kg N ha-1 and left 12 t dry matter ha-1 for the second maize crop. However, the 2017/18 maize yields were not affected by the N recycled by B. brizantha, whereas N2O emissions were higher in the plots with brachiaria, suggesting that part of the recycled N was released too early after desiccation. Brachiarias showed no evidence of causing nitrification inhibition. The strategy of intercropping brachiarias did not increase maize yield, although it added C and recycled N in the system.

Effects of long-term conservation tillage on N2 and N2O emission rates and N2O emission microbial pathways in Mollisols. Conservation tillage is widely used in farmland management for soil carbon sequestration, but it can also lead to potential emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). Therefore, our study is aimed to investigate the effects of 15 years of no-tillage combined with four straw mulching levels of 0 % (NT0), 33 % (NT33), 67 % (NT67), and 100 % (NT100) compared to ridge tillage (RT) on the rates of N2O and N-2 emissions and the respective contributions of four microbial pathways to N2O emissions. The incubation experiments were conducted at two different moisture levels (55 % and 100 % WFPS) by using dicyandiamide inhibition and N-15-labeling techniques. Soil samples were collected from the 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil depths across three maize growth stages: seedling, jointing, and maturity. Our results showed that conservation tillage significantly decreased the N2O + N-2 emission at 55 % WFPS, but it has a reverse influence in N2O + N-2 emission at 100 % WFPS. The proportion of N2O in gaseous N loss were higher at 100 % WFPS than at 55 % WFPS. Among the four microbial pathways for N2O emissions, autotrophic nitrification was the dominant pathway 55 %WFPS. The contribution of autotrophic nitrification remarkably decreased, co-denitrification and denitrification increased at 100 %WFPS. Overall, at 100 % WFPS, N2O emissions from all major microbial pathways were positively correlated with GWC, temperature, TC, TN, NH4+-N, and NO3--N, but negatively correlated with soil pH and C/N ratios. Our results suggest that long-term conservation tillage increases N2O and N-2 emissions from the soil under water-saturated conditions by regu-lating soil nutrient levels, soil moisture, and microbial pathways. Therefore, we should consider the impact of conservation tillage on N2O emission risk when we attach importance to the role of conservation tillage in improving soil quality and increasing crop yields.

How does deep-band fertilizer placement reduce N2O emissions and increase maize yields?. It is unclear how deep-band fertilizer placement influences N2O emission and maize (Zea mays L.) yield, and the production and diffusion of N2O within the soil profile under deep-band fertilizer placement treatments. Thus, we conducted a field experiment in 2019-2020 with spring maize to study the effects of different fertilization depths of 5 cm (D5), 15 cm (D15), 25 cm (D25), and 35 cm (D35) on N2O emissions. The N2O concentration in the fertilized soil profile was measured to calculate the N2O diffusion and production rates, and the surface N2O emissions were measured simultaneously. The results showed that the availability of NO3--N in the soil was the main factor related to N2O production and emissions, and N2O emissions were strongly related to the production and diffusion of N2O in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Deep-band fertilizer placement significantly reduced surface N2O emissions, and the N2O production and diffusion rates in the 0-20 cm soil profile. The cumulative N2O diffusion in the 0-20 cm layer accounted for 79.2%, 73.7%, 58.2%, and 48.6% of those in 0-40 cm soil depth under D5, D15, D25, and D35, respectively. Compared with D5, D25 and D35 significantly reduced the N2O emissions by 30.8% and 59.3%, respectively, N2O-N emission factors by 41.6% and 80.0%, and yield-scaled N2O-N by 39.3% and 58.2%. D25 also increased the maize yield by 13.8% and obtained the highest nitrogen use efficiency (NUE, 43.6%), whereas D35 had negative effects on the maize yield and NUE. Therefore, deep-band fertilizer placement reduced the N2O production rate and diffusion flux in the near-surface soil layer by decreasing the NO3--N content in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Thus, the location where N2O was produced transferred to the deeper soil layer to reduce surface N2O emissions. The recommended fertilization depth of 25 cm can reduce N2O emissions and significantly enhance the maize yield, N uptake, biomass, and NUE.

Nitrogen fertilization promoted microbial growth and N2O emissions by increasing the abundance of nirS and nosZ denitrifiers in semiarid maize field. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are a major source of gaseous nitrogen loss, causing environmental pollution. The low organic content in the Loess Plateau region, coupled with the high fertilizer demand of maize, further exacerbates these N losses. N fertilizers play a primary role in N2O emissions by influencing soil denitrifying bacteria, however, the underlying microbial mechanisms that contribute to N2O emissions have not been fully explored. Therefore, the research aimed to gain insights into the intricate relationships between N fertilization, soil denitrification, N2O emissions, potential denitrification activity (PDA), and maize nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in semi-arid regions. Four nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates, namely N0, N1, N2, and N3 (representing 0, 100, 200, and 300 kg ha(-1) yr.(-1), respectively) were applied to maize field. The cumulative N2O emissions were 32 and 33% higher under N2 and 37 and 39% higher under N3 in the 2020 and 2021, respectively, than the N0 treatment. N fertilization rates impacted the abundance, composition, and network of soil denitrifying communities (nirS and nosZ) in the bulk and rhizosphere soil. Additionally, within the nirS community, the genera Cupriavidus and Rhodanobacter were associated with N2O emissions. Conversely, in the nosZ denitrifier, the genera Azospirillum, Mesorhizobium, and Microvirga in the bulk and rhizosphere soil reduced N2O emissions. Further analysis using both random forest and structural equation model (SEM) revealed that specific soil properties (pH, NO3--N, SOC, SWC, and DON), and the presence of nirS-harboring denitrification, were positively associated with PDA activities, respectively, and exhibited a significant association to N2O emissions and PDA activities but expressed a negative effect on maize NUE. However, nosZ-harboring denitrification showed an opposite trend, suggesting different effects on these variables. Our findings suggest that N fertilization promoted microbial growth and N2O emissions by increasing the abundance of nirS and nosZ denitrifiers and altering the composition of their communities. This study provides new insights into the relationships among soil microbiome, maize productivity, NUE, and soil N2O emissions in semi-arid regions.

Agricultural management strategies for balancing yield increase, carbon sequestration, and emission reduction after straw return for three major grain crops in China: A meta-analysis. Straw return can improve crop yield as well as soil organic carbon (SOC) but may raise the possibility of N2O and CH4 emissions. However, few studies have compared the effects of straw return on the yield, SOC, and N2O emissions of various crops. Which management strategies are the best for balancing yield, SOC, and emission reduction for various crops needs to be clarified. A meta-analysis containing 2269 datasets collected from 369 studies was conducted to investigate the influence of agricultural management strategies on yield increase, soil carbon sequestration, and emission reduction in various crops after the straw return. Analytical results indicated that, on average, straw return increased the yield of rice, wheat, and maize by 5.04%, 8.09%, and 8.71%, respectively. Straw return increased maize N2O emissions by 14.69% but did not significantly affect wheat N2O emissions. Interestingly, straw return reduced the rice N2O emissions by 11.43% but increased the CH4 emissions by 72.01%. The recommended nitrogen application amounts for balancing yield, SOC, and emission reduction varied among the three crops, while the recommended straw return amounts were more than 9000 kg/ha. The optimal tillage and straw return strategies for rice, wheat, and maize were plow tillage combined with incor-poration, rotary tillage combined with incorporation, and no-tillage combined with mulching, respectively. A straw return duration of 5-10 years for rice and maize and <= 5 years for wheat was recommended. These findings provide optimal agricultural management strategies after straw return to balance the crop yield, SOC, and emission reduction for China's three major grain crops.

Full straw incorporation into a calcareous soil increased N2O emission despite more N2O being reduced to N2 in the winter crop season. Crop straw application in combination with fertilizer nitrogen (N) dose reduction is recommended to improve crop yields and carbon sequestration in soil. This practice may also promote soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, thus partially counterbalancing the expected benefits. However, the full straw return effect on the reduction of soil N2O to dinitrogen (N2) is not yet well known, owing to the methodological difficulties in quantifying soil N2 fluxes against the high atmospheric N2 concentration. This study was carried out in a long-term experimental field of a calcareous soil cultivated with summer maize and winter wheat in rotation. For the three field treatments since 2006, i.e., optimal fertilizer N with and without full straw return, and the control (without N and straw application), we conducted in- or ex-situ observations on field N2O fluxes, soil N2 emissions, crop yields, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and soil/environmental factors. During a rotation cycle, we found that soil ammonium and nitrite concentrations, moisture and temperature jointly determined the N2O emissions, while nitrate concentration, dissolvable organic carbon to nitrate-N ratio and moisture jointly dominated the N2 emissions. Compared to straw removal, the straw return promoted reduction of more soil N2O to N2 in the wheat season than in the maize season, showing increases in the N2 emissions by 57% versus - 10% (P = 0.06). Nevertheless, it significantly enhanced the N2O emissions measured in situ by approximately 137% and 21% in the wheat and maize seasons, respectively (P < 0.05). It also significantly increased the annual crop yields by 20% on average (P < 0.05). Meanwhile it tended to enhance the SOC stock (0-20 cm) by 15 parts per thousand yr- 1 (P = 0.14), showing a trend of more intensive carbon sequestration than the direct soil N2O emission (-948 versus 378 kg CO2e ha- 1 yr- 1 on average). We conclude that the long-term full straw return helps to sequester more carbon that offsetting the enhanced N2O emissions from the calcareous soil in the rotation system as it promotes reduction of more N2O to N2 in the wheat season.

Effects of N levels on land productivity and N2O emissions in maize-soybean relay intercropping. BACKGROUND: Relay intercropping of maize and soybean can improve land productivity. However, the mechanism behind N2O emissions in this practice remains unclear. A two-factor randomized block field trial was conducted to reveal the mechanism of N2O emissions in a full additive maize-soybean relay intercropping. Factor A was three cropping systems - that is, monoculture maize (Zea mays L.), monoculture soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) and maize-soybean relay intercropping. Factor B was different N supply, containing no N, reduced N and conventional N. Differences in N2O emissions, soil properties, rhizosphere bacterial communities and yield advantage were evaluated. RESULTS: The land equivalent ratio was 1.55-2.44, and the cumulative N2O emission (CEN2O) was notably lower by 60.2% in intercropping than in monoculture, respectively. Reduced N declined CEN2O without penalty on the yield advantages. The relay intercropping shifted soil properties - for example, soil organic matter, total N, NH4+ and protease activity - and improved the soil microorganism community - for example, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Intercropping reduced CEN2O by directly suppressing nirS- and amoA-regulated N2O generation during soil N cycling, or nirS- and amoA-mediated soil properties shifted to reduce CEN2O indirectly. Reduced N directly reduced CEN2O by decreasing soil N content and reducing soil microorganism activities to alleviate N2O produced in soil N cycling. CONCLUSION: Conducting a full additive maize-soybean relay intercropping with reduced nitrogen supply provides a way to alleviate N2O emissions without the penalty on the yield advantage by changing rhizosphere bacterial communities and soil N cycling.

Matching fertilization with available soil water storage to tackle the trade-offs between high yield and low N2O emissions in a semi-arid area: Mechanisms and solutions. Large fertilizer nitrogen (N) input has created favorable conditions for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in semi-arid areas. However, it remains to be determined whether the major contradictions between high yield and N2O emissions reduction can be reconciled by matching fertilization with water availability. A 3-year field experiment was conducted in the Loess Plateau of northwest China, monitored N2O fluxes over five N application rates (0, 120, 175, 230, and 285 kg N ha(-1)), and examined the environmental factors and crop production in a rainfed maize field. Results showed that available soil water storage at sowing (ASWS) is crucial in promoting soil N2O emissions by altering soil NO3--N, organic C, and organic N availability in semi-arid agroecosystems. The cumulative N2O emissions exponentially increased with increasing N rates. However, the cumulative N2O emissions were moderately low (1.20 kg N ha(-1)) at the N application rate of 230 kg ha(-1), where maize yield was maximized, after which N2O emissions remarkably increased by 27.88 %. This result suggests that reduced N application to levels satisfying crop needs could significantly reduce N2O emissions with a minor yield penalty. Furthermore, water availability determines the absorption and utilization of nutrients by crops on the Loess Plateau and ultimately determines grain yield. Therefore, an N2O emission-yield curve was established to determine whether the target crop yield could be obtained by adjusting water availability and N fertilization rates while reducing N2O emissions. Our results suggest that N application rates at 218.7-230.0 kg ha(-1), ensuring ASWS at 209.5-215.2 mm at sowing and precipitation within 61-90 days after sowing at 184.2-194.0 mm is ideal for matching fertilization with water availability to balancing high yield and mitigating N2O emissions in the study region.

Emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide from soil receiving urban wastewater for maize (Zea mays L.) cultivation. We investigated how amending maize with wastewater at 120 kg N ha(-1) affected crop growth, soil characteristics and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) compared to plants fertilized with urea. Maize growth response was similar when fertilized with urea or wastewater despite a delayed release of nutrients upon mineralization of the organic material in the wastewater. Applying wastewater to soil significantly increased the mean CO2 emission rate 2.4 times to 1.74 A mu g C kg(-1) soil h(-1) compared to the unamended soil (0.74 A mu g C kg(-1) soil h(-1)), and cultivating maize further increased it 3.2 times (5.61 A mu g C kg(-1) soil h(-1)). Irrigating soil with wastewater, cultivating it with maize or applying urea had no significant effect on the emission of N2O compared to the unamended soil (1.49 x 10(-3) A mu g N kg(-1) soil h(-1)). Adding urea to soil did no affect the CH4 oxidation rate (0.1 x 10(-3) A mu g C kg(-1) soil h(-1)), nor did cultivating maize in the urea-amended soil, but adding wastewater to soil resulted in a significant production of CH4 (128.4 x 10(-3) A mu g C kg(-1) soil h(-1)). Irrigating soil with wastewater increased the global warming potential (GWP) 2.5 fold compared to the urea amended soil, while in soil cultivated with maize GWP increased 1.4 times. It was found that irrigating crops with wastewater might limit the use of N fertilizer and water from aquifers, but the amount applied should be limited because nitrate (NO (3) (-) ) leaching and emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 will be substantial and the increased soil salt content will limit crop growth.

Deep soils modify environmental consequences of increased nitrogen fertilizer use in intensifying Amazon agriculture. Agricultural intensification offers potential to grow more food while reducing the conversion of native ecosystems to croplands. However, intensification also risks environmental degradation through emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrate leaching to ground and surface waters. Intensively-managed croplands and nitrogen (N) fertilizer use are expanding rapidly in tropical regions. We quantified fertilizer responses of maize yield, N2O emissions, and N leaching in an Amazon soybean-maize double-cropping system on deep, highly-weathered soils in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Application of N fertilizer above 80 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1) increased maize yield and N2O emissions only slightly. Unlike experiences in temperate regions, leached nitrate accumulated in deep soils with increased fertilizer and conversion to cropping at N fertilization rates >80 kg N ha(-1), which exceeded maize demand. This raises new questions about the capacity of tropical agricultural soils to store nitrogen, which may determine when and how much nitrogen impacts surface waters.

Agroenvironmental Performances of Biochar Application in the Mineral and Organic Fertilization Strategies of a Maize-Ryegrass Forage System. Biochar, included as a soil amendment by EU Regulation 2019/1009, has been shown to increase soil organic C stock and nutrient retention. We investigated the effect of biochar incorporation alone (B) and in association with mineral (BMin), digestate (BDig) and slurry (BSlu) fertilization, compared to the respective controls without biochar (C, Min, Dig and Slu), in a silage maize-Italian ryegrass rotation, on yield, soil fertility parameters and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Two types of biochar in three doses (0.2, 0.45, 0.9%) were tested in two cropping seasons. Biochar did not significantly affect maize yield; however, BDig tended to increase silage yield and the ear component compared to Dig, while BMin tended to reduce maize N uptake compared to Min. Biochar incorporation significantly increased soil organic C (+31%) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) (+13%) in all the fertilization treatments; BMin and BDig also showed an increase compared to biochar alone (B). Emission of N2O was mainly driven by fertilization, digestate exhibiting the highest emissions. Biochar addition decreased the cumulative N2O emissions consistently in all the fertilization treatments, though not significantly. The association of biochar with organic fertilizers, in particular digestate, appears promising in increasing the fertilizer efficiency and reducing N2O emissions.

Reducing nitrous oxide emissions from irrigated maize by using urea fertilizer in combination with nitrapyrin under different tillage methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of nitrification inhibitor (nitrapyrin; NI) as a mitigation option for yield-scaled emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) under tillage management and urea fertilization in the irrigated maize fields in northern Iran. A split-plot experiment was performed based on a randomized completed blocks design with three replicates. The main plots were the levels of tillage practices (conventional tillage (CT) and minimum tillage (MT), and the subplots were the fertilizer treatments (control, urea, and urea + NI). The gas samples for measuring N2O emissions were collected during the maize growing season from June to September, using opaque manual circular static chambers. Soil samples were taken at 0-10 cm to determine water-filled pore space, ammonium (NH4+), and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in the soil. When the crop reached physiological maturity, maize was harvested to measure grain yield, biomass production, N uptake of aboveground, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The results showed that the applying NI in combination with urea reduced the total N2O emissions by up to 58% and 64% in MT and CT, respectively. In the urea + NI treatment, mean soil concentrations of NH4+ and NO3- were significantly higher (20%) and lower (23.5%), respectively, compared with other treatments. The NI reduced the yield-scaled N2O-N emission up to 79% and 55% for CT and MT, respectively. Furthermore, compared to treatment with urea alone, the application of NI increased the NUE of the MT and CT systems by an average of 55% and 46%, respectively. This study emphasized that the application of nitrapyrin should be encouraged in irrigated maize fields, in order to minimize N2O emissions and improve NUE and biomass production.

Measurement and mitigation of nitrous oxide emissions from a high nitrogen input vegetable system. The emission and mitigation of nitrous oxide (N2O) from high nitrogen (N) vegetable systems is not well understood. Nitrification inhibitors are widely used to decrease N2O emissions in many cropping systems. However, most N2O flux measurements and inhibitor impacts have been made with small chambers and have not been investigated at a paddock-scale using micrometeorological techniques. We quantified N2O fluxes over a four ha celery paddock using open-path Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy in conjunction with a backward Lagrangian stochastic model, in addition to using a closed chamber technique. The celery crop was grown on a sandy soil in southern Victoria, Australia. The emission of N2O was measured following the application of chicken manure and N fertilizer with and without the application of a nitrification inhibitor 3, 4-dimethyl pyrazole phosphate (DMPP). The two techniques consistently demonstrated that DMPP application reduced N2O emission by 37-44%, even though the N2O fluxes measured by a micrometeorological technique were more than 10 times higher than the small chamber measurements. The results suggest that nitrification inhibitors have the potential to mitigate N2O emission from intensive vegetable production systems, and that the national soil N2O emission inventory assessments and modelling predictions may vary with gas measurement techniques.

Quantifying nitrous oxide fluxes on multiple spatial scales in the Upper Midwest, USA. This study seeks to quantify the roles of soybean and corn plants and the cropland ecosystem in the regional N2O budget of the Upper Midwest, USA. The N2O flux was measured at three scales (plant, the soil-plant ecosystem, and region) using newly designed steady-state flow-through plant chambers, a flux-gradient micrometeorological tower, and continuous tall-tower observatories. Results indicate that the following. (1) N2O fluxes from unfertilized soybean (0.03 +/- 0.05 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) and fertilized corn plants (-0.01 +/- 0.04 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) were about one magnitude lower than N2O emissions from the soil-plant ecosystem (0.26 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for soybean and 0.95 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for corn), confirming that cropland N2O emissions were mainly from the soil. (2) Fertilization increased the corn plant flux for a short period (about 20 days), and late-season fertilization dramatically increased the soybean plant emissions. (3) The direct N2O emission from cropland accounted for less than 20 % of the regional flux, suggesting a significant influence by other sources and indirect emissions, in the regional N2O budget.

Short-Term Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Cattle Slurry for Silage Maize: Effects of Placement and the Nitrification Inhibitor 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole Phosphate (DMPP). Cattle slurry is an important nitrogen source for maize on dairy farms. Slurry injection is an effective measure to reduce ammonia emissions after field application, but with higher risk of nitrous oxide emission than surface application. This study compared soil mineral nitrogen dynamics and nitrous oxide emissions with two ways of application. First, traditional injection at 25 cm spacing between rows followed by ploughing (called \"non-placed slurry\"), and second, injection using a new so-called goosefoot slurry injector that placed the slurry in ploughed soil as a 30 cm broad band at 10 cm depth below maize crop rows with 75 cm spacing (named \"placed slurry\"). Furthermore, the effect of treating slurry with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) in Vizura (R) was tested with both application methods. The field experiment was conducted on a sandy loam soil in a temperate climate. Both nitrous oxide emissions, and the dynamics of soil mineral nitrogen, were monitored for eight weeks after slurry application and seeding of maize using static chambers. The level of nitrous oxide emissions was higher with non-placed compared to placed slurry (p < 0.01), mainly due to higher emissions during the first four weeks. This might be due to higher rates of nitrification and in turn stimulation of denitrification. In both placed and non-placed slurry treatments, Vizura (R) caused higher soil ammonium concentrations and lower nitrate concentrations (p < 0.001), particularly from 3 to 8 weeks after slurry application. The final level of soil nitrate was similar with and without the nitrification inhibitor, but higher with placed compared to non-placed slurry. Adding Vizura (R) to non-placed slurry reduced nitrous oxide emissions by 70% when compared to untreated slurry. Surprisingly, there was a non-significant trend towards higher cumulative emissions from placed slurry with the nitrification inhibitor compared to untreated slurry, which was due to higher emissions in the last part of the monitoring period (5-7 weeks after slurry application). Possibly, degradation of the nitrification inhibitor and nitrification activity inside the slurry band as the soil dried promoted nitrous oxide emissions by this time. In summary, placement of untreated slurry in a broad band under maize seeds reduced nitrous oxide emissions compared to non-placed slurry with more soil contact. A comparable reduction was achieved by adding a nitrification inhibitor to non-placed slurry. The pattern of nitrous oxide emissions from placed slurry treated with the inhibitor was complex and requires more investigation. The emission of nitrous oxide was highest when nitrate accumulated in soil around decomposing cattle slurry, and mitigation strategies should aim to prevent this. This study demonstrated a potential for mitigation of nitrous oxide emission by placement of cattle slurry, which may be an alternative to the use of a nitrification inhibitor.

N2 and N2O mitigation potential of replacing maize with the perennial biomass crop Silphium perfoliatum-An incubation study. Sustainability of biogas production is strongly dependent on soil-borne greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during feedstock cultivation. Maize (Zea mays) is the most common feedstock for biogas production in Europe. Since it is an annual crop requiring high fertilizer input, maize cropping can cause high GHG emissions on sites that, due to their hydrology, have high N2O emission potential. On such sites, cultivation of cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) as a perennial crop could be a more environmentally friendly alternative offering versatile ecosystem services. To evaluate the possible benefits of perennial cup plant cropping on GHG emissions and nitrogen losses, an incubation study was conducted with intact soil cores from a maize field and a cup plant field. The N-15 gas flux method was used to quantify N source-specific N-2 and N2O fluxes. Cumulated N2O emissions and N-2+N2O emissions did not differ significantly between maize and cup plant soils, but tended to be higher in maize soil. Soils from both systems exhibited relatively high and similar N2O/(N-2+N2O) ratios (N(2)Oi). N2O emissions originating from sources other than the N-15-labelled NO3 pool were low, but were the only fluxes exhibiting a significant difference between the maize and cup plant soils. Missing differences in fluxes derived from the N-15 pool indicate that under the experimental conditions with high moisture and NO3- level, and without plants, the cropping system had little effect on N fluxes related to denitrification. Lower soil pH and higher bulk density in the cup plant soil are likely to have reduced the mitigation potential of perennial biomass cropping.

Enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs) can reduce nitrous oxide emissions and maintain high grain yields in a rain-fed spring maize cropping system. Context: Enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs) have provided opportunities for the simultaneous mitigation of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and increases in crop productions. However, the practice of combining EENFs with optimal fertilization under conditions of misaligned water and fertilizer inputs in rain-fed spring maize systems remains inadequately understood. Objective: This study aims to determine the factors controlling N2O emissions under the soil climatic conditions in rain-fed plastic mulching cropping systems treated with different nitrogen (N) fertilization rates and EENFs, and to determine the most effective N fertilization measure to reduce N2O emissions while maintaining crop yields. Methods: A 3-year field experiment was conducted in a spring maize system located in the semiarid rain-fed region of the Loess Plateau, applying two types of EENFs: a nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) and a slow-release fertilizer (SRF). It comprised five fertilization treatments: unfertilized (CK), conventional N rate (CON, 200 kg N ha(-1)), optimal N rate (OPT, 160 kg N ha(-1)), OPT with the addition of DCD (OPT+DCD), and OPT using SRF (OPT-SRF). Results: The average annual cumulative N2O emissions over the 3-year experimental period ranged from 0.74 to 1.87 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Fertilizer N contributed 26 60% to annual N2O emissions. The highest N2O fluxes (50-161 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) typically occurred within the initial 10 days following fertilization, likely induced by strong nitrification processes, constituting 12-19% of the annual N2O emissions during this brief period. In comparison to the CON treatment, the OPT, OPT+DCD, and OPT-SRF treatments resulted in significant reductions in annual N2O emissions of 24%, 46%, and 34%, respectively, without causing any significant decrease in maize grain yields. The application of DCD led to increased ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations while reducing nitrate (NO3--N). Conversely, using SRF resulted in a decrease in both NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations. Conclusions: Using EENFs at the ideal fertilization rate significantly curtailed yearly N2O emissions without adversely affecting maize yields in a rain-fed plastic mulching spring maize system prevalent in the Loess Plateau. Most N2O emissions occurred post-fertilization, with rainfall events further influencing these emissions. Implications: Our findings recommend the incorporation of nitrification inhibitors, such as DCD, as the most effective fertilizer measure for reducing N2O emissions in the rain-fed region of the Loess Plateau.

The effect of urea and pig slurry fertilization on denitrification, direct nitrous oxide emission, volatile fatty acids, water-soluble carbon and anthrone-reactive carbon in maize-cropped soil from the Po plain (Modena, Italy). The use of zootechnical slurries in agriculture can increase N losses as N2O by direct emission and by denitrification, The aim of this research was to determine the influence of pig slurry, as well as its combination with mineral N, on N2O emissions in the field and their relationships with some fractions of soil organic matter, with soil moisture and with rainfall, In spite of varying amounts of organic substance applied, the diverse agronomic treatments did not produce substantial differences in N losses due to denitrification. Wide variations between the slurry fertilized and the urea-fertilized plots were not found, whereas the combination of pig slurry with urea usually produced an increase both in N2O emissions due to denitrification and in direct N2O emissions (N losses corresponding to about 50% of those due to denitrification). The greatest losses of N2O-N occurred in the first month following fertilizer administration. N2O emissions due to denitrification were highest in the days immediately following the administration of fertilizers and lowest in a later period. N2O emissions due to nitrification occurred later. Therefore, N2O emission via nitrification differed from N2O losses via denitrification which, under optimal conditions, presented peaks of activity during the whole growth cycle. The N2O-N losses were highly influenced by physical parameters, particularly rain. An increase in micropore water creates conditions of scarce oxygenation or of anaerobiosis which influence oxidation-reduction processes and, at the same time, can limit the diffusion of bacteria-produced gas towards the soil surface.

The emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), one of the main greenhouse gases, which contributes significantly to global warming, is a major challenge in modern agriculture. The effects of land use systems on N2O emissions are the result of multiple variables, whose interactions need to be better understood. In this sense, this study analyzed the possible effects of different soil managements, crop rotations and sequences, as well as edaphoclimatic factors causing N2O emissions from soils in the Cerrado biome (scrubland). The following four land-use systems were evaluated: 1) No-tillage cultivation with biennial crop rotations and sequences: legume-grass and alternating grass-legume crops in the second season - NT-SS/MP; 2) No-tillage with biennial rotations and sequences: grass-legume and alternating second crop of legume-grass - NT-MP/SS; 3) Conventional planting with disc harrow and biennial legume-grass rotation-CT-S/M; and 4) Native Cerrado (CE), no agricultural land use. The legume and grass species, planted in the two no-tillage treatments were soybean, followed by sorghum BRS3.32 (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) (SS), and maize, followed by pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) (MP). Nitrous oxide emissions were evaluated for 25 months (October 2013 to October 2015), and the results were grouped in annual, total, growing and non-growing seasons, as well as yield-scaled N2O emissions. The mean N2O fluxes were 24.14, 15.71, 32.49 and 1.87 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the NT-SS/MP, NT-MP/SS, CT-S/M and Cerrado areas respectively. Cumulative N2O fluxes over the total evaluation period from the systems NT-SS/MP, NT-MP/SS, CT-S/M and CE, respectively, were 3.47, 2.29, 4.87 and 0.26 kg ha(-1). A correlation between N2O fluxes and the environmental variables was observed, with the exception of water-filled pore space (WFPS), but N2O peaks were associated with WFPS values of >65%. In the 2014-2015 growing season, yield-scaled N2O emissions from NT-MP/SS were lower than from CT-S/M. A multi-factor approach indicated that conventional management with main season soybean or maize and no alternating crop sequence intensifies soil N2O emissions in the Cerrado.

Soil carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions during the growing season from temperate maize-soybean intercrops. The Argentine Pampa is one of the major global regions for the production of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. [Merr.]), but intense management practices have led to soil degradation and amplified greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents preliminary data on the effect of maize-soybean intercrops compared with maize and soybean sole crops on the short-term emission rates of CO2 and N2O and its relationship to soil moisture or temperature over two field seasons. Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the maize sole crop and intercrops, whereas soil bulk density was significantly lower in the intercrops. Soil CO2 emission rates were significantly greater in the maize sole crop but did not differ significantly for N2O emissions. Over two field seasons, both trace gases showed a general trend of greater emission rates in the maize sole crop followed by the soybean sole crop and were lowest in the intercrops. Linear regression between soil GHG (CO2 and N2O) emission rates and soil temperature or volumetric soil moisture were not significant except in the 1:2 intercrop where a significant relationship was observed between N2O emissions and soil temperature in the first field season and between N2O and volumetric soil moisture in the second field season. Our results demonstrated that intercropping in the Argentine Pampa may be a more sustainable agroecosystem land-management practice with respect to GHG emissions.

Rice husk biochar and crop residue amendment in subtropical cropping soils: effect on biomass production, nitrogen use efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. We investigated the effect of maize residues and rice husk biochar on biomass production, fertiliser nitrogen recovery (FNR) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions for three different subtropical cropping soils. Maize residues at two rates (0 and 10 t ha(-1)) combined with three rates (0, 15 and 30 t ha-1) of rice husk biochar were added to three soil types in a pot trial with maize plants. Soil N2O emissions were monitored with static chambers for 91 days. Isotopic N-15-labelled urea was applied to the treatments without added crop residues to measure the FNR. Crop residue incorporation significantly reduced N uptake in all treatments but did not affect overall FNR. Rice husk biochar amendment had no effect on plant growth and N uptake but significantly reduced N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in two of the three soils. The incorporation of crop residues had a contrasting effect on soil N2O emissions depending on the mineral N status of the soil. The study shows that effects of crop residues depend on soil properties at the time of application. Adding crop residues with a high C/N ratio to soil can immobilise N in the soil profile and hence reduce N uptake and/or total biomass production. Crop residue incorporation can either stimulate or reduce N2O emissions depending on the mineral N content of the soil. Crop residues pyrolysed to biochar can potentially stabilise native soil C (negative priming) and reduce N2O emissions from cropping soils thus providing climate change mitigation potential beyond the biochar C storage in soils. Incorporation of crop residues as an approach to recycle organic materials and reduce synthetic N fertiliser use in agricultural production requires a thorough evaluation, both in terms of biomass production and greenhouse gas emissions.

Effect of legume intercropping on N2O emissions and CH4 uptake during maize production in the Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia. Intercropping with legumes is an important component of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in sub-Saharan Africa, but little is known about its effect on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. A field experiment was established at Hawassa in the Ethiopian rift valley, comparing nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in minerally fertilized maize (64 kg N ha(-1)) with and without Crotalaria (C. juncea) or lablab (L. purpureus) as intercrops over two growing seasons. To study the effect of intercropping time, intercrops were sown either 3 or 6 weeks after maize. The legumes were harvested at flowering, and half of the above-ground biomass was mulched. In the first season, cumulative N2O emissions were largest in 3-week lablab, with all other treatments being equal to or lower than the fertilized maize mono-crop. After reducing mineral N input to intercropped systems by 50% in the second season, N2O emissions were comparable with the fully fertilized control. Maize-yield-scaled N2O emissions in the first season increased linearly with aboveground legume N yield (p = 0:01), but not in the second season when early rains resulted in less legume biomass because of shading by maize. Growing-season N2O-N emission factors varied from 0.02% to 0.25% in 2015 and 0.11% to 0.20% in 2016 of the estimated total N input. Growing-season CH4 uptake ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 kg CH4-C ha(-1), with no significant differences between treatments or years but setting off the N2O-associated emissions by up to 69 %. Our results suggest that leguminous intercrops may increase N2O emissions when developing large biomass in dry years but, when mulched, can replace part of the fertilizer N in normal years, thus supporting CSA goals while intensifying crop production in the region.

Advancing agroecosystem management through strategic cover crop selection: The role of species identity and community composition for productivity and climate change mitigation. Context: Cover cropping may improve soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and soil carbon (C) stocks, yet its effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil greenhouse gas balances remain unclear. The impact of cover crop species and mixtures varies over time, requiring further study. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the agronomic and environmental performance of different cover crops, including hairy vetch, rye, radish, their mixtures, and a seven-species mix, over three years. Methods: Over a three-year field experiment, we tested nine cover crop treatments - including rye, hairy vetch, radish, and their mixtures - and assessed their effects on biomass production, nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) inputs, soil macronutrients (N, P, K), greenhouse gas emissions (N2O), and yields of maize, sunflower, and soybean. Results: Hairy vetch and rye produced higher biomass, while radish contributed most to soil C inputs below-ground. Hairy vetch provided high N inputs (>200 kg N ha(-1) annually) but increased N2O emissions, revealing a trade-off between fertility and greenhouse gas emissions. Rye and radish emitted less N2O, with rye increasing soil organic C and potassium availability. The rye and vetch mixture combined high biomass production and soil C sequestration with moderate N2O emissions, making it a promising option for balancing productivity and sustainability. Rye-based treatments achieved a positive net soil CO2 balance. Sunflower and maize N uptake improved after vetch and rye-vetch cover crops, while soybean yield remained unaffected. Conclusion and implications: Cover crop mixtures with complementary traits can balance productivity and environmental impacts. Integrating rye and vetch enhances ecological functions, supporting sustainable crop production while mitigating climate change.

Effect of agricultural management system (\"cash crop\", \"livestock\" and \"climate optimized\") on nitrous oxide and ammonia emissions. The study aimed to measure soil-atmosphere N2O fluxes and their controlling factors, as well as NH3 emissions and yields for two soils (silt loam and clay loam) in three management systems over two years under subsequent wheat and maize cultivation. The management systems were characterized as follows: (1) cash crop (C) with mineral fertilizer and conventional tillage; (2) livestock (L) with biogas residue fertilization and its incorporation prior to sowing in maize and reduced tillage; and (3) climate optimized (O) with minimum tillage, 8-year crop rotation, with biogas residue fertilization, in maize without incorporation in clay loam soil or incorporation by strip-tillage prior to seeding in silt loam soil. Stable isotope ratios of N2O and mineral N were determined to identify N2O processes. Within the organically fertilized maize treatments, cumulative N2O fluxes were highest in the O-system treatments of both sites (4.0 to 9.4 kg N ha- 1 a- 1), i.e. more than twice as high as in the L-system (1.5 to 3.1 kg N ha- 1 a- 1). Below root-strip till fertilizer application did not enhance N2O fluxes. Fluxes with mineral fertilization of wheat (1.1 to 3.1 kg N ha- 1 a- 1) were not different from those with organic fertilization. Isotopic values of emitted N2O revealed that bacterial denitrification dominated most of the peak flux events, while the N2O/(N2 + N2O) ratio of denitrification was mostly between 0.1 and 0.5. It can be concluded that, contrary to the intention to lower greenhouse gas fluxes by the O-system management, the highest N2O fluxes occurred in the O-system without biogas digestate incorporation in maize. With respect to NH3 fluxes, we could confirm that the application of digestate application in growing crops without incorporation or late incorporation in fertilization before sowing induces high fluxes. The beneficial aspects of the O-system including more stable soil structure and resource conservation, are thus potentially counteracted by increased N2O and NH3 emissions.

Soil type affects not only magnitude but also thermal sensitivity of N2O emissions in subtropical mountain area. It is a concern whether the effect of soil type on N2O emissions has to be considered for regional mitigation strategies and emission estimates in mountainous areas with inherent spatial heterogeneities of soil type. To date, there were few field experiments which investigated soil type effects on N2O emissions. Thus a 2-year field study was conducted to measure N2O emissions and soil environmental variables from three different soils that were formed from similar parental rock under the same climate. Seasonal N2O fluxes ranged from 0.18 to 0.40 kg N ha(-1) for wheat seasons and 0.40 to 1.50 kg N ha(-1) for maize seasons across different experimental soils. The intra-and inter-annual variations in N2O emissions were mainly triggered by temporal dynamics of soil temperature and moisture conditions. On average, seasonal N2O fluxes for acidic soils were significantly lower than for neutral and alkaline soils in cold-dry wheat seasons while significantly greater than for neutral and alkaline soils in warm-wet maize seasons. These determined differences of N2O emissions were mainly caused by differences of initial soil properties across different soils. Moreover, seasonal N2O fluxes were positively correlated with soil pH in wheat seasons, but negatively correlated in maize seasons. The temperature sensitivity coefficient (Q(10)) of soil N2O emissions for acidic soil (4.06) were significantly greater than those for neutral (1.82) and alkaline (1.15) soils. Overall, N2O emissions for acidic soils were not only higher than those for neutral and alkaline soils but also more sensitive to changing temperature. The present study highlights that soil type is needed to be carefully considered for regional estimate and proposing mitigation strategy of N2O emissions especially in subtropical mountain regions with inherent great heterogeneity of soil type.

Soil Greenhouse Gas and Ammonia Emissions in Long-Term Maize-Based Cropping Systems. Legume rotations and animal manures can reduce synthetic fertilizer use in row crops, but only long-term experiments can elucidate effects of multiple legume rotations and decades of manure additions on soil gas emissions. In 2006 and 2007, we measured soil-atmosphere fluxes of N2O, NH3, and CO2 in maize (Zea mays L.) crops within a replicated experiment comparing continuous maize to maize-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) rotations initiated in 1969. In both systems, comparisons of synthetic fertilizer N and manure N were initiated in 1990. With synthetic fertilizer as the main N source, mean CO2-C fluxes (from March 31st to October 18th) were lower from continuous maize (CC, 512 +/- 132 g m(-2) growing season(-1)) than from maize following alfalfa (CA, 691 +/- 91 g m(-2) growing season(-1)). In contrast, with manure as the main N source, mean soil CO2-C fluxes from CC (943 +/- 111 g m(-2) growing season(-1)) were greater than from CA (682 +/- 21 g m(-2) growing season(-1)). Soil CO2-C emissions correlated with long-term inputs of manure. Synthetically fertilized continuous maize had lower N2O-N fluxes (0.36 +/- 0.26 g m(-2) growing season(-1)) than other treatments (0.55-0.58 g m(-2) growing season(-1)). Nitrous oxide-N fluxes were not correlated with current N inputs or soil nitrate concentrations, suggesting that long-term treatment effects (e.g., on soil structure, labile C, or microbial communities) contribute to contemporary N2O variation. Elevated NH3 fluxes (>5 mg NH3-N m(-2) h(-1)) followed manure applications, but within weeks there were no significant treatment differences in NH3 fluxes. These results suggest that short-term or single-factor studies may not capture important interactions among crop rotations and N sources affecting greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soils.

Nitrogen Application Effect on Maize Yield, NH3, and N2O Emissions in Northeast China by Meta-Analysis. Ammonia volatilization (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission are the main underliers of nitrogen loss in farmlands, which can decrease nitrogen use efficiency and trigger environmental problems regarding greenhouse effects. Previous studies have regional limitations and lack universal guiding significance, as they are primarily based on individual experiments related to the effects of applying nitrogen fertilizer on maize. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis on a regional scale to investigate the overall impact of nitrogen fertilizer application on maize yield, N2O, and NH3 in Northeast China. The database included 85 studies and 1147 pairs of experimental data that were analyzed. The results showed that applying nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased maize yield, N2O emissions, and NH3 volatilization effects, and the growth rates (E) were 50.64%, 64.39%, and 69.25%, respectively. In Northeast China, the average emission factors of N2O and NH3 were 0.72% and 8.21%, respectively. The optimum nitrogen application rate for maize in Northeast China was 205 kg ha(-1), resulting in 8.37% nitrogen loss (through N2O and NH3). Soil texture, alkaline nitrogen (AN) content in the soil, mean annual precipitation (MAP), nitrogen application rate, and fertilizer type were the key influential factors affecting changes in maize yield and N loss (N2O and NH3). Yield-scaled N2O and NH3 were found to be the significant emission reduction parameters that ensured maize yield. However, there was a remarkable 'seesaw effect' between yield-scaled N2O and NH3 under the same natural conditions (MAP and soil texture). Therefore, human activities such as reducing N surplus in soil, and N fertilizer application rate, along with selecting suitable fertilizer types should be given more attention to reduce yield-scaled N2O and NH3. Moreover, minimizing NH3 and N2O dual emission should be the main objective for green agriculture in Northeast China, rather than over-emphasizing on single emission reduction.

Global cropland nitrous oxide emissions in fallow period are comparable to growing-season emissions. Croplands account for similar to one-third of global anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. A number of recent field experiments found substantial fallow-period N2O emissions, which have been neglected for decades. However, the global contribution of the fallow-period emissions and the associated drivers remain unclear. Based on 360 observations across global agroecosystems, we simulated the ratio of the fallow to the whole-year N2O emissions (R-fallow) by developing a mixed-effect model and compiling cropping-system-specific input data. Our results revealed that the mean global gridded R-fallow was 44% (15%-75%, 95% confidence interval), with hotspots mainly in the northern high latitudes. For most cropping systems, soil pH was the dominant driver of global variation in R-fallow. Global cropland emission factors (i.e., the percentage of fertilizer N emitted as N2O, EFs) in EF-based models doubled to 1.9% when the fallow-period N2O emissions were included in our simulation, similar to EFs estimated by process-based and atmospheric inversion models (1.8%-2.3%). Overall, our study highlights the importance of fallow-period N2O emissions in annual totals, especially for single cropping systems and croplands in acidic areas. To accurately estimate N2O emissions for national greenhouse gas inventories, it is crucial to update current EFs with full consideration of the fallow-period N2O emissions in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 method.

Disentangling direct and indirect effects of mycorrhiza on nitrous oxide activity and denitrification. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas emitted at considerable rates from agricultural soils. A few recent studies have indicated the potential to reduce N2O emission rates in agricultural systems through management of soil microbiota, such as mycorrhizal fungi. Our limited understanding of how mycorrhiza influences N2O emission rates, however, forestalls such management practices. To address the knowledge gap regarding the mechanism of mycorrhizal modification of N2O formation and denitrification, we disentangle the direct effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) via hyphal growth on potential denitrification activity from those resulting from indirect AMF-induced changes in soil aggregation. We manipulated AMF status in a factorial experiment through adding or not AMF inoculum in the form of Rhizophagus irregularis and soil aggregation state through either crushing soil aggregates or using agricultural soil with intact soil aggregates. We then grew Zea mays (maize) in compartmentalized mesocosms for 4 months. At harvest, we observed approximately three-fold higher AMF root colonization and hyphal densities in the treatments where we had added Rhizophagus irregularis. Potential N2O activity rates and the denitrification ratio were higher in the undisturbed soil and in the mesocosms with a dense AMF hyphal network (direct effect of mycorrhiza). Further, AM-hyphae promoted soil aggregation while also altering potential denitrification activity (indirect effect of mycorrhiza). Overall, we present here a comprehensive case study on how mycorrhiza alters potential denitrification activity and related N2O activity from agricultural soils.

Nitrification inhibitor's effect on mitigating N2O emissions was weakened by urease inhibitor in calcareous soils. The application of nitrification or urease inhibitors together with nitrogen (N) fertilizer has been proposed to reduce N losses, including nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, from agricultural soils. We measured N2O fluxes, crop yield and plant N content over 3 years (2012-2015) to evaluate the long-term effects of nitrification and/or urease inhibitors on N2O emissions, crop production and N use efficiency (NUE) in an intensively farmed wheat maize system in northern China. The experiment consisted of the following five treatments: 1) CK, no N fertilizer; 2) U, urea; 3) NI, urea with 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP); 4) UI, urea with N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT); and 5) NIUI, urea with combined DMPP and NBPT. Compared with the U treatment, the NI, NIUI and UI treatments mitigated cumulative N2O emissions by 55%, 40% and 21% in the maize season, respectively, and 47%, 40% and 33% in the wheat season, respectively. The annual direct emission factors of N2O for the U, NI, UI and NIUI treatments were 0.4%, 0.1%, 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. The NIUI, NI and UI treatments increased the annual crop yield (7%, 6% and 4%) and the NUE (15%, 10% and 7%) relative to the U treatment. The NI treatment showed the best effect on mitigating N2O emissions, but its efficacy was reduced when applied together with UI. This indicates that more studies are required focusing on the performances and mechanisms of these two inhibitors in alkaline and low organic carbon soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effect of crop residue returns on N2O emissions from red soil in China. For a long time, farmers in the red soil region of southern China have returned crop residues to the soil, but how various crop residues influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is not well understood. We compared the influence of returning different crop residues [rapeseed cake (RC), maize straw, rice straw and wheat straw (WS)] in combination with different levels of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (nil, low and high) on red soil N2O emissions. Results confirmed the inverse relationship between cumulative N2O emissions and residue C:N ratio in red soil under different levels of N fertilizer. However, N-fertilizer application did not significantly influence N2O emissions in the WS (which had the highest C:N ratio) and corresponding control treatments, while it enhanced N2O emissions in the RC (which had the lowest C:N ratio) treatment and displayed significantly higher cumulative N2O emissions with low N fertilizer application. This phenomenon may be attributed to the poor nutrient content in red soil, which leads to Liebig's Law of the Minimum' on available C. N fertilizer application provided sufficient available N, while the readily available C, which was mainly dependent on the degradability of the residue, became the crucial factor influencing N2O emissions. Additional experiments, which showed that the addition of glucose and sucrose could increase N2O emissions when N (NH4+-N) was sufficient, confirmed this hypothesis. Thus, to reduce N2O emissions when returning residues to red soil, we suggest that both the residue C:N ratio and the quality should be considered when deciding whether to apply N fertilizer.

Fluxes of N2 and N2O and contributing processes in summer after grassland renewal and grassland conversion to maize cropping on a Plaggic Anthrosol and a Histic Gleysol. Grassland renewal and grassland conversion to arable land are common agricultural practices on intensively used grassland sites, especially in north-western Europe. However, grassland ploughing can cause a flush of soil organic nitrogen (N) mineralisation due to soil disturbance during tillage and decomposition of stubble and roots from the old grass sward. This is known to result in enhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but information about the underlying microbial processes, especially the role of N2O reduction to N-2 via denitrification, is scarce. Therefore we applied the N-15 gas flux method in situ to grassland recently ploughed under for maize cropping, renewed grassland and permanent grassland on a Histic Gleysol and a Plaggic Anthrosol which differed in organic matter content and drainage. We used needle injection of N-15-labelled KNO3- at three different depths in the soil to achieve homogeneous label distribution. Fluxes of N2O and N-2, mineral N concentration and N-15 enrichment of these were measured for 44 days after label addition. Overall, no differences in N2O and N-2 emissions were found between grassland conversion/renewal and permanent grassland. N-2 emissions increased up to 9115 g N ha(-1) day(-1) on a single sampling day following grassland conversion to maize cropping on the Histic Gleysol, leading to a great contribution of denitrification when N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratio was low. However, heterogeneity of N-15 label distribution proved to be a major difficulty in the water-saturated Histic Gleysol and caused potential uncertainty in identification of various production pathways. Lower gaseous losses and higher nitrification potential were detected in the Plaggic Anthrosol, indicating a higher threat of possible leaching of excess mineral N following grassland conversion/renewal.

Effects of 3,4-dimethylphyrazole phosphate-added nitrogen fertilizers on crop growth and N2O emissions in Southern Italy. The effect of the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylphyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on N-fertilized crop growth and soil N2O emissions were studied at two experimental sites in Southern Italy, characterised by a Mediterranean climate and different soil texture. The experiments were a randomized block design of two treatments: crop fertilized with NH4NO3 (considered the control treatment) or amended with DMPP plus NH4NO3 (considered the DMPP treatment). ANOVA was performed to assess differences between treatments and fertilization periods whereas simple and multiple linear regressions were performed in order to assess the effect of the soil-related independent variables on soil gases emissions. Growth of potato plants fertilized with DMPP-added nitrogen was enhanced compared to control plants, whereas no benefit on maize plants grown during summer was observed. N2O emissions measured from soil to potato after the first fertilization with DMPP-added nitrogen was reduced during winter, but was higher than control after the second fertilizer application in spring, leading to comparable N2O emission factors (EF1) between treatments. In maize N2O emissions and EF1 were lower for DMPP compared to control treatment. The effectiveness of reduction in soil N2O emission was influenced by soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) in both experimental sites. However, the overall effect of WFPS was contrasting as N2O emissions were decreased in potato and enhanced in maize.

Model comparison and quantification of nitrous oxide emission and mitigation potential from maize and wheat fields at a global scale. Maize and wheat are major cereals that contribute two-thirds of the food energy intake globally. The two crops consume about 35% of the nitrogen (N) fertilizer used in agriculture and thereby contribute to fertilizer-induced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Thus, estimation of spatially disaggregated N2O emissions from maize and wheat fields on a global scale could be useful for identifying emission and mitigation hotspots. It could also be needed for prioritizing mitigation options consistent with location-specific production and environmental goals. N2O emission from four models (CCAFS-MOT, IPCC Tier-I, IPCC Tier-II and Tropical N2O) using a standard gridded dataset from global maize and wheat fields were compared and their performance evaluated using measured N2O emission data points (777 globally distributed datapoints). The models were used to quantify spatially disaggregated N2O emission and mitigation potential from maize and wheat fields globally and the values were compared. Although the models differed in their performance of capturing the level of measured N2O emissions, they produced similar spatial patterns of annual N2O emissions from maize and wheat fields. Irrespective of the models, predicted N2O emissions per hectare were higher in some countries in East and South Asia, North America, and Western Europe, driven mainly by higher N application rates. The study indicated a substantial N2O abatement potential if application of excess N in the maize and wheat systems is reduced without compromising the yield of the crops through technological and crop management innovations. N2O mitigation potential is higher in those countries and regions where N application rates and current N2O emissions are already high. The estimated mitigation potentials are useful for hotspot countries to target fertilizer and crop management as one of the mitigation options in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Nitrous oxide emissions from an ultisol of the humid tropics under maize-groundnut rotation. Nitrous oxide (N2O) contributes to global climate change and agricultural soils seem to be the major source. Lack of information led to this study on the influence of different amounts and sources of nitrogen on N2O emission from a maize (Zea mays L.)-groundnut (Arachis hypogae L.) crop rotation in an Ultisol of the humid tropics. The treatments were: inorganic N + crop residues (NC), inorganic N only (RN), and half of inorganic N + crop residues + chicken manure (NCM). The corresponding amount of N applied was 322, 180, and 400 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The N2O emissions depended on the amounts and types of N. A maximum peak (9889 +/- 2106 muLg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)) was detected at 2 wk before maize sowing amended with chicken manure, showing a persistent influence on N transformations and N2O release. The mineral N from either applied source became low by 2 to 4 wk, coinciding with the small N2O fluxes or its consumption to a few isolated instances. The N2O flux significantly correlated with the mineral N and water-filled pore spaces. The direct annual N2O emission was 3.94 +/- 0.23, 1.90 +/- 0.08, and 1.41 +/- 0.07 kg N2O-N ha(-1) from the NCM, NC, and RN treatments, respectively. The corresponding N2O-N loss of the applied N plus N fixed by groundnut was 0.83,0.49, and 0.59%. Overestimations of direct annual N2O emission using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology suggest a location-specific emission factor for variable N sources to be considered.

Estimates of N2O Emissions and Mitigation Potential from a Spring Maize Field Based on DNDC Model. Agricultural production plays an important role in affecting atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations. Field measurements were conducted in Dalian City, Liaoning Province in Northeast China from two consecutive years (2009 and 2010) to estimate N2O emissions from a spring maize field, a main cropping system across the Chinese agricultural regions. The observed flux data in conjunction with the local climate, soil and management information were utilized to test a process-based model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), for its applicability for the cropping system. The validated DNDC was then used for exploring strategies to reduce N2O emissions from the target field. The results showed that the major N2O pulse emissions occurred with duration of about 3-5 d after fertilizer application in both years 2009 and 2010, which on average accounted for about 60% of the total N2O emissions each year. Rainfall and fertilizer application were the major factors influencing the N2O emissions from spring maize field. The average N2O fluxes from the CK (control plot, without fertilization) and FP (traditional chemical N fertilizer) treatments were 23.1 and 60.6 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in 2009, respectively, and 21.5 and 64.3 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in 2010, respectively. The emission factors (EFs) of the applied N fertilizer (270 kg N ha(-1)) as N2O-N were 0.62% in 2009 and 0.77% in 2010, respectively. The comparison of modeled daily N2O emission fluxes against observations indicated that the DNDC model had a good performance even if without adjusting the internal parameters. The modeled results showed that management practices such as no-till, changing timing or rate of fertilizer application, increasing residue incorporation, and other technically applicable measures could effectively reduce N2O emissions from the tested fields. Our study indicated that avoiding application of N fertilizers at heavy rainfall events or splitting the fertilizer into more applications would be the most feasible approaches to reduce N2O emissions from spring maize production in Northeast China.

Plastic mulching significantly improves soil enzyme and microbial activities without mitigating gaseous N emissions in winter wheat-summer maize rotations. Plastic mulching is an important agricultural practice to increase crop yield by increasing soil temperature and moisture. Plastic mulching can also affect soil greenhouse gas emissions [e.g., N2O emissions and NH3 volatilization] and soil characteristics such as soil enzyme and microbial activities, but the simultaneous effects of plastic mulching on these parameters and the potential links between them are rarely evaluated. Here, we conducted a field study to investigate the concurrent responses of N2O emissions, NH3 volatilization, soil enzyme and microbial activities, soil dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON), and crop yield to plastic mulching (mulching) and no mulching (ambient) under consecutive winter wheat-summer maize rotation cycles in China's Loess Plateau. The mulching treatment significantly increased soil water-filled pore spaces (WFPS) and soil temperature during growing cycle 1 (2018-2019 winter wheat and 2019 summer maize) and cycle 2 (2019-2020 winter wheat and 2020 summer maize). Averaged across both growing cycles, the mulching treatment significantly increased winter wheat yield by 31.8 %, summer maize yield by 36.4 %, soil NO3--N content by 18.2 %, NH4+-N content by 27.4 %, cumulative N2O emissions by 34.0 % and NH3 volatilization by 50.6 %, relative to the ambient treatment. Moreover, the mulching treatment significantly enhanced soil alkaline phosphatase, invertase, catalase, and urease activities and soil microbial biomass C and N contents in the 0-10 cm soil layer across both growing cycles. This study revealed a tradeoff, with plastic mulching significantly improving crop yields and soil enzyme and microbial activities but not mitigating N2O emissions or NH3 volatilization. Our results highlight that simultaneously documenting gaseous N emissions and changes in soil properties under plastic mulching can advance the understanding of sustainable agriculture in semi-arid areas.

Linking feedstock and application rate of biochars to N2O emission in a sandy loam soil: Potential mechanisms. Biochar amendment has been proposed as a strategy to improve soil quality and mitigate climate change. Yet the extent and regulating mechanisms of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in response to amendment of biochars derived from different feedstock have not been clearly demonstrated. A 12-month field trial was conducted to study the impact of two distinct biochar feedstocks (pine chip and peanut shell, at 10 and 30 t ha(-1)) with (+N) and without nitrogen (N) (-N) fertilization on soil N dynamics, N2O emissions, plant performance and microbial gene abundance. The cumulative N2O emissions varied greatly with biochar feedstock and application rate, and N fertilization. Pine biochar (at 30 t ha(-1)) significantly increased N2O emissions (by 48%) compared to control under -N, while peanut shell biochar (at 30 t ha(-1)) significantly increased N2O emissions (by 131%) compared to control under +N. Overall, biochar amendments had no impact on soil mineral N (NH4+ and NO3-) under both -N and +N. Under -N, biochar amendments showed no effect on plant yield, whereas under +N yield was significantly improved by 25-27% from pine biochar treatments. Under +N, only pine biochar (at 10 t ha(-1)) significantly increased plant N uptake (by 47%), and only peanut shell biochar (at 30 t ha(-1)) significantly enhanced soil AOB, narG, nirS and nosZ gene abundance. Increased soil N2O emission under -N from pine biochar amendment is likely to be regulated by improved water retention. However, increases in N2O emission from peanut shell biochar under +N could be driven by its large N inputs, labile organic C concentration and the increased soil pH which might largely facilitate biotic processes as evidenced by higher narG, nirS and AOB gene abundance. Positive feedback to N2O emission by biochar application revealed from this study is inconsistent with many current biochar studies, showing that caution should be exercised when considering use of biochar to mitigate N2O emission.

Impact of liming and maize residues on N2O and N2 fluxes in agricultural soils: an incubation study. Since it is known that nitrous oxide (N2O) production and consumption pathways are affected by soil pH, optimising the pH of agricultural soils can be an important approach to reduce N2O emissions. Because liming effects on N2O reduction had not been studied under ambient atmosphere and typical bulk density of arable soils, we conducted mesoscale incubation experiments with soils from two liming trials to investigate the impact of long-term pH management and fresh liming on N transformations and N2O production. Soils differed in texture and covered a range of pH levels (3.8-6.7), consisting of non-limed controls, long-term field-limed calcite and dolomite treatments, and freshly limed soils. Both soils were amended with N-15-labelled potassium nitrate (KNO3) and incubated with and without incorporated maize litter. Packed soil mesocosms were cycled through four phases of alternating temperatures and soil moistures for at least 40 days. Emissions of N2O and dinitrogen (N-2) as well as the product ratio of denitrification N2O/(N2O + N-2), referred to as N(2)Oi were measured with the N-15 gas flux method in N-2-reduced atmosphere. Emissions of N2O increased in response to typical denitrifying conditions (high moisture and presence of litter). Increased temperature and soil moisture stimulated microbial activity and triggered denitrification as judged from (NO3-)-N-15 pool derived N2O + N-2 emissions. Fresh liming increased denitrification in the sandy soil up to 3-fold but reduced denitrification in the loamy soil by 80%. N(2)Oi decreased throughout the incubation in response to fresh liming from 0.5-0.8 to 0.3-0.4, while field-limed soils had smaller N(2)Oi (0.1-0.3) than unlimed controls (0.9) irrespective of incubation conditions. Our study shows that the denitrification response (i.e., N2O + N-2 production) to liming is soil dependent, whereas liming effects on N(2)Oi are consistent for both long- and short-term pH management. This extends previous results from anoxic slurry incubation studies by showing that soil pH management by liming has a good mitigation potential for agricultural N2O emissions from denitrification under wet conditions outside of cropping season.

Plastic film mulching affects N2O emission and ammonia oxidizers in drip irrigated potato soil in northwest China. In soil, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxiclizing archaea (AOA) are regarded as key factors mediating nitrous oxide (N2O) production and emission. However, there are scarce reports about the effect of film mulching on ammonia oxidizers, and the biological nitrification process of N2O emission is unclear. This study was based on potato field experiments under different mulching films, including polyethylene mulching film (PM), transparent degradable mulching film (TDM), black degradable mulching film (BDM), and bare land (CK). AOB and AOA abundances were estimated using real-Lime PCR, and their diversity and community structure were measured using high-throughput sequencing. Result revealed that the total N2O emission from CI< was 12.32%-41.03% higher than that from film mulching soil. Under film mulching, according to total N2O emission from soil and N2O concentration in soil treatments were ordered as PM > BDM > TDM, and N2O production was closely correlated with copy numbers of the amoA gene. BDM significantly increased the number of arrioA-AOB gene copies (P < 0.01), and PM significantly increased the those of wnoA-AOA (P < 0.01). BDM and TDM increased AOB operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chaol, Simpson, and Shannon indices, while PM increased the AOA OTUs and Chaol index. Variations in AOA abundance and diversity were closely related to soil mineral N and temperature changes induced by polyethylene film mulching (P < 0.05), whereas AOB showed no significant association with soil properties. Meanwhile, we did not find a distinct treatment effect on AOB community structure. Our findings indicate that (i) degradable film mulching increased AOB abundance and diversity and N2O concentration, but obviously reduced N2O emissions, and (ii) AOA were more sensitive than AOB W polyethylene mulching film.

Maize residue input rather than cover cropping influenced N2O emissions and soil-crop N dynamics during the intercrop and cash crop periods. The well-known benefits of cover cropping for mitigating climate change and improving soil quality could be threatened by increased greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, such practices could have negative consequences in the context of global climate change. The present year-long field experiment, carried out under irrigated semiarid conditions, evaluated the effect of returning maize crop residues at two topsoil input levels in combination with bare fallow, a cereal (barley, Hordeum vulgare L.) and a legume (vetch, Vicia sativa L.) as cover crops as part of an annual cover crop-cash crop (maize, Zea mays L.) rotation. In addition, control plots, without the addition of nitrogen fertilizer (either in the previous cropping season or during the experiment), were established following the same experimental design in order to assess the carry-over impact of residual nitrogen from prior crops. Nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured together with soil mineral nitrogen and crop yields and nitrogen use efficiency. The significant effect of maize residue input on N2O emissions during the cover crop phase (this was 43% greater for the lower maize residue input than for the higher) was offset after subsequent maize fertilization (there was a 170% increase following the higher maize residue input compared to the lower). Although no differences in soil mineral nitrogen content were reported between treatments before maize fertilization, N2O emissions were 72% higher on the fertilized plots than on the control plots. Before maize fertilization, N2O emissions were increased by the incorporation of cover crop residues and soil rewetting after irrigation, with the highest N2O fluxes being reported for the cereal crop. Cumulative CO2 fluxes were higher in the plots with cover crops (cereal and legume) than in bare fallow plots, while CH4 sink was not affected by cover cropping or maize residue input. The grain yield penalty for maize production (a 7% decrease) with the legume cover crop on the nitrogen fertilized plots (the opposite of what was observed in the control area) highlights the need for an accurate estimation of the nitrogen supply from the mineralization of legume residues. Overall, cover crop and maize residue input did not have any significant effect on annual cumulative N2O emissions, so the positive effects of these practices should be considered to recommend them under semiarid conditions for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Effect of chemical and mechanical grassland conversion to cropland on soil mineral N dynamics and N2O emission. Grassland conversion to cropland bears a risk of increased nitrate (NO3-) leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission due to enhanced nitrogen (N) mineralization. This study investigates the dynamics of mineral N and N2O emissions following chemical and mechanical conversion from permanent grassland to cropland (maize) at two sites with different texture (clayey loam and sandy loam) and fertilization regime (with and without mineral N-fertilization) over a two-year period. Soil mineral N levels increased shortly after conversion and remained elevated in converted plots compared to permanent grassland or long-term cropland in the second year of investigation. Fluxes of N2O were higher from converted plots than permanent grassland or cropland. However, soil mineral N contents and cumulative N2O emissions did not differ between conversion types. Only the distribution of N2O losses over the two years differed: while losses were of similar magnitude in both years in mechanically converted plots, the major part of N2O loss in chemically converted plots occurred in the first year after conversion while emissions approximated grassland level in the second year. N2O fluxes were mainly controlled by water-filled pore space and soil NO3- levels. Despite differences in N levels at the two sites, these key findings are similar on both study sites. They indicate strongly accelerated mineralization after conversion, an effect that still lasted in the converted plots at the end of the two-year investigation irrespective of the conversion type used.

Nitrous oxide emissions in soils cropped with maize under long-term tillage and under permanent pasture in New Zealand. Information on the influence of tillage on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is needed by researchers, policy makers and farmers for assessment of global ramifications of warming potential of greenhouse gas NO. This research evaluates the effects of continuous long-term tillage and seasonal changes in N2O emissions in New Zealand temperate climate. The experiment was conducted in a Kairanga silty clay loam (Eutric. Gleysol) where maize (Zea mays L.) was grown continuously for either 17 (K17) or 34 (K34) years, with conventional tillage. An adjacent permanent ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and clover (Trifolium sp.) pasture (PP) was used as a control. Mean N2O emissions under K17 and K34 and PP ranged from 0.04 to 1.35, 0.03 to 1.13, and 0.03 to 0.99 g N2O-N/ha/h, respectively. Average annual N2O emissions from K34 were slightly lower than those in the K17 fields although there were no differences in N2O emissions between PP and K17. Depleted organic C, total N and microbial biomass C in K34 as compared with K17, possibly limited denitrification process and decreased N2O emissions. Soil water content (SWC) was a key factor controlling N2O emissions in both pasture and cropped soils. Low emissions occurred when gravimetric SWC content was less than 30%. N2O emissions from grazed pasture were low during summer (dry) period and increased during winter (wet) season. There were no differences in N2O between the K17 and K34 during dry season but N2O emission rates in wet season were lower in the K34. Despite high temporal variability observed in the N2O emissions, our estimates based on low frequency of measurements over I year were in general agreement with those in the literature.

Temporal and spatial patterns of N2O emissions in maize/legume strip intercropping: Effects of straw incorporation and crop interactions. Context: Maize/legume intercropping presents a sustainable agricultural strategy to enhance nitrogen use efficiency and mitigate environmental impacts. Research question: The impact of maize/legume strip intercropping on N2O emissions, crop yields, and the associated mechanisms are not yet fully understood, particularly in the context of straw incorporation practices. Methods: A two-year field experiment comparing five cropping systems (maize/peanut strip intercropping, maize/soybean strip intercropping, and corresponding monocropping) either with or without straw incorporation. Results: Maize/legume strip intercropping increased yields by 15-24 % and reduced N2O emissions by 15-22 % compared to the expected intercropping. This increase in yields, combined with the reduction in N2O emissions, led to a 20-39 % reduction N2O emission per unit of production in intercropped systems. The primary reduction in emissions occurred 7-10 days after the second fertilization, accounting for over half of the total emission reduction. Spatial analysis revealed that the majority of the reduction originated from the maize and interaction rows. Soil nitrate (NO3-) concentration emerged as the most critical factor influencing N2O flux, with NH4+ concentration also playing a significant role. Notably, straw incorporation did not increase N2O emissions from intercropping systems, while yield tended to increase, albeit not significantly. Conclusions: Maize/legume strip intercropping enhances nitrogen utilization, significantly mitigates N2O emissions, and boosts crop productivity; however, these effects remain consistent regardless of straw incorporation practices. Significance: This study highlights the advantages of maize/legume strip intercropping systems in reducing N2O emissions and its potential contribution to crop production.

Deficit irrigation interacting with biochar mitigates N2O emissions from farmland in a wheat-maize rotation system. Biochar application to agricultural fields is an effective carbon sequestration measure that has the potential to reduce N2O emissions and increase soil water holding capacity. However, the interaction mechanisms of biochar under deficit irrigation on N2O emissions remain unclear. A two-year field experiment is conducted in the Guanzhong Plain, China, in order to quantify the effects of biochar and deficit irrigation on N2O emissions from winter wheat-summer maize crop rotation and to investigate the potential mechanisms of nitrification and denitrification. According to the combination of biochar application and actual evapotranspiration-based irrigation scheduling, four treatments are designed (B1W100: biochar 30 .ha(-1) + ET; B1W80: biochar 30 t.ha(-1)+ 0.8 ET; B0W100: no biochar + ET; B0W80: no biochar + 0.8ET). The soil N2O flux, soil physical and chemical properties, and key functional gene abundance related to N2O emissions in nitrification and denitrification at different growth stages are investigated and discussed. Results show that the interaction between deficit irrigation and biochar significantly reduces soil N2O emissions. During the wheat and maize season, the application of biochar reduces the N2O emissions by an average of 12.9% and 15.2%, respectively. Deficit irrigation also reduces the N2O emissions by an average of 17.4% and 15.5%, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis shows that soil N2O is significantly correlated with soil water-filled pore space during the phase with intense N2O emissions. Soil functional gene abundance is determined at different growth stages for both wheat and maize. Maximum soil denitrification functional gene abundance is observed at the time when wheat and maize enter the stage of their peak growth at the jointing stage. With biochar addition and deficit irrigation, the abundance of nirK and nosZ genes increases and AOB amoA genes decreases. These results suggest that biochar with deficit irrigation is a better solution to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils.

Changes in soil pore structure generated by the root systems of maize, sorghum and switchgrass affect in situ N2O emissions and bacterial denitrification. Due to the heterogeneous nature of soil pore structure, processes such as nitrification and denitrification can occur simultaneously at microscopic levels, making prediction of small-scale nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the field notoriously difficult. We assessed N2O+N-2 emissions from soils under maize (Zea mays L.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and energy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), three potential bioenergy crops in order to identify the importance of different N2O sources to microsite production, and relate N2O source differences to crop-associated differences in pore structure formation. The combination of isotopic surveys of N2O in the field during one growing season and X-ray computed tomography (CT) enabled us to link results from isotopic mappings to soil structural properties. Further, our methodology allowed us to evaluate the potential for in situ N2O suppression by biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) in energy sorghum. Our results demonstrated that the fraction of N2O originating from bacterial denitrification and reduction of N2O to N-2 is largely determined by the volume of particulate organic matter occluded within the soil matrix and the anaerobic soil volume. Bacterial denitrification was greater in switchgrass than in the annual crops, related to changes in pore structure caused by the coarse root system. This led to high N-loses through N-2 emissions in the switchgrass system throughout the season a novel finding given the lack of data in the literature for total denitrification. Isotopic mapping indicated no differences in N2O-fluxes or their source processes between maize and energy sorghum that could be associated with the release of BNI by the investigated sorghum variety. The results of this research show how differences in soil pore structures among cropping systems can determine both N2O production via denitrification and total denitrification N losses in situ.

Influence of water regime and N availability on the emission of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide from tropical, semi-arid soils of Chiapas, Mexico. The concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased considerably over the last century, but few studies are available showing their production from soils in semi-arid areas. Soils from the tropical semi-arid Central Depression of Chiapas were sampled from fields cultivated with maize (MAI treatment), under canopy of Acacia angustissima (TIMBRE) or outside the canopy of the trees (OUT), adjusted to 40%, 60%, 80% or 100% of water-holding capacity (WHC) and amended with 0, 15 or 50 mg (NH4NO3)-N kg(-1) dry soil. The production of N2O, CO2 and concentrations of NH4+, and NO3- were monitored in the laboratory under aerobic conditions. Production of N2O in the first 3 days was significantly larger from the MAI and OUT soils, compared to the TIMBRE soil, while the addition of 50 mg inorganic N doubled the production of N2O. In all treatments, soil at 100% WHC had the largest production of N2O. The emission of CO2 was significantly larger from soils at 60% and 80% WHC compared to the soil at 40% and 100% WHC, although the addition of inorganic N had no significant effect on CO2 emission. The application of inorganic N and the absence of vegetation increased the production of N2O. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Matching crop row and dripline distance in subsurface drip irrigation increases yield and mitigates N2O emissions. Intensive irrigation and nitrogen (N) fertilization are often linked to low N-fertilizer efficiency, and to high emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Efficient irrigation systems (e.g. subsurface drip irrigation [SDI]) combined with N-fertigation in a no-till agroecosystem can promote N-use efficiency, thereby curbing N2O emissions without depressing crop yield. Yet, crop type and SDI plant settings (and management) such as dripline spacing may determine the agronomic and environmental performance of SDI. In this two-year field study on maize (Zea mays L.) - soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) rotation with conservation agriculture management (notill and cover crops), we investigated the effects of three different irrigation/fertilization systems (SDI with a narrow dripline spacing (70 cm) + fertigation with ammonium sulphate, SDI with a large dripline spacing (140 cm) + fertigation with ammonium sulphate, and sprinkler irrigation [SPR] + granular urea application) on yield, N-fertilizer efficiency, and N2O emissions in a fine-textured soil. We hypothesized that SDI systems (especially with narrow dripline distance) would increase yield and mitigate N2O compared with SPR, and particularly for maize due to its higher water and nutrient demand. We found that SDI increased maize yield (+31%) and Nfertilizer efficiency (+43-71%). These positive results were only observed during the drier year in which irrigation supplied ca. 80% of maize water requirements. The narrower dripline spacing mitigated N2O emissions compared with sprinkler irrigation (by 44%) and with the wider spacing (by 36%), due to a more homogeneous distribution of N in soil, and to a lower soil moisture content. Soybean yield and N-use efficiency were not affected by the irrigation systems. We also found that SPR enhanced cover crop residue decomposition, thus promoting the release of C and N into the soil and increasing N2O emissions. Overall, our study provides important insights on key management decisions that define the sustainability of novel irrigation systems; in particular SDI with a 70 cm dripline distance should be promoted for maize to increase productivity and decrease N2O emissions in fine-textured soils.

Disaggregated N2O emission factors in China based on cropping parameters create a robust approach to the IPCC Tier 2 methodology. China accounts for a third of global nitrogen fertilizer consumption. Under an International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 2 assessment, emission factors (EFs) are developed for the major crop,types using country-specific data. IPCC advises a separate calculation for the direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions of rice cultivation from that of cropland and the consideration of the water regime used for irrigation. In this paper we combine these requirements in two independent analyses, using different data quality acceptance thresholds, to determine the influential parameters on emissions with which to disaggregate and create N2O EFs. Across China, the N2O EF for lowland horticulture was slightly higher (between 0.74% and 1.26% of fertilizer applied) than that for upland crops (values ranging between 0.40% and 1.54%), and significantly higher than for rice (values ranging between 0.29% and 0.66% on temporarily drained soils, and between 0.15% and 0.37% on un-drained soils). Higher EFs for rice were associated with longer periods of drained soil and the use of compound fertilizer; lower emissions were associated with the use of urea or acid soils. Higher EFs for upland crops were associated with clay soil, compound fertilizer or maize crops; lower EFs were associated with sandy soil and the use of urea. Variation in emissions for lowland vegetable crops was closely associated with crop type. The two independent analyses in this study produced consistent disaggregated N2O EFs for rice and mixed crops, showing that the use of influential cropping parameters can produce robust EFs for China.

Three-year measurements of nitrous oxide emissions from cotton and wheat-maize rotational cropping systems. The remarkable expansion of fertilization and irrigation may stimulate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from cropping systems in northern China. High-resolution measurements were conducted in irrigated cotton and wheat-maize rotational systems in Shanxi Province, P.R. China, between 2007 and 2010 (three year-round crop cycles, hereinafter referred to as Y1, Y2 and Y3) to investigate the impacts of natural inter-annual variations and agricultural management on annual N2O emissions and direct emission factors (EFs). Overall, N2O emissions fluctuated diurnally, seasonally and inter-annually in the fertilized treatments. The hourly N2O fluxes closely followed the daily air temperature patterns. The daily mean fluxes corresponded to these hourly fluxes, which were observed between 09:00-10:00 and 19:00 -20:00. An optimized sampling protocol could improve the reliability of discrete measurements when estimating cumulative emissions. The N2O emissions for the fertilized treatments were 2.7 +/- 0.2 (Y1) and 1.6 +/- 0.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (Y2) from the cotton field and 6.2 +/- 0.4 (Y1), 4.5 +/- 0.3 (Y2) and 4.5 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (Y3) from the wheat-maize field. Peak N2O emissions after fertilization and irrigation/rainfall lasted one to three weeks and accounted for 16-55% of the annual emissions. Leaching losses were estimated at 10.4 +/- 3.0 (Y1) and 12.5 +/- 3.4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (Y2), which accounted for 16-17% of the fertilizer-N applied to the cotton field. Annual N2O emissions did not increase with increasing fertilization rates or water inputs because significant amounts of fertilizer-N were lost through leaching. Background emissions amounted to one-third to one-half of the total N2O emissions from the fertilized treatments. The direct EFs were 2.2 +/- 0.3% (Y1) and 0.9 +/- 0.2% (Y2) in the cotton field and 1.3 +/- 0.2% (Y1), 0.8 +/- 0.1% (Y2) and 0.7 +/- 0.1% (Y3) in the wheat-maize field. The large inter-annual variations in N2O emissions and direct EFs emphasize the importance of multiple-year continuous observations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Zinc-nitrogen co-fertilization influences N2O emissions and microbial communities in an irrigated maize field. Previous studies have shown that the use of zinc (Zn) chelate fertilizers combined with a nitrogen (N) fertilizer (urea) can lead to both agronomic (i.e., yields and Zn and N biofortification due to the synergies between both nutrients) and environmental (i.e., by reducing the emissions of nitrous oxide, N2O, derived from N fertilization) benefits under rainfed semi-arid conditions. However, little is known about the effect of Zn-N co-fertilization on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or soil microbial processes involved in N2O fluxes under non-flooded irrigated conditions (during the dry season). Under these conditions, water-filled pore space continuously fluctuates following a periodic pattern and soil temperatures are in the optimum range for soil microorganisms. In this context, a field experiment was conducted using a maize (Zea mays L.) crop treated with two N levels (no N application and 120 kg N ha(-1) as urea), and three Zn sources (no Zn application, Zn sulphate, and Zn applied with a mixture of chelating compounds, DTPA-HEDTA-EDTA). Nitrous oxide, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured using opaque chambers, as well as the total abundances of soil bacteria, archaea and nitrifier and denitrifier communities. Zn-N co-fertilization increased cumulative N2O emissions from 0.36 kg N-N2O ha(-1) (for urea combined with Zn chelates) to 0.76 kg N-N2O ha(-1) (for urea combined with Zn sulphate), with respect to urea without Zn application. The N2O emission factors were lower (0.34%-0.72%) than the IPCC default value of 1%. Total abundances of the nosZ denitrification gene, which is involved in the reduction in N2O to dinitrogen (N-2), were reduced by 75% on average in the plots that received Zn fertilizers. This reduction may explain the higher N2O emissions in these treatments. In contrast with the case with non-irrigated crops, Zn-N co-fertilization cannot be recommended as a strategy to mitigate N2O emissions in irrigated maize under semiarid conditions, despite of the enhancement of Zn availability in soil.

Optimal biochar amendment rate reduced the yield-scaled N2O emissions from Ultisols in an intensive vegetable field in South China. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, vegetable yields, and soil microbial properties were studied in response to different rates of rice-straw biochar applied to an intensive vegetable soil (Ultisol) in South China. The study was conducted over a one-year period as a block-designed field experiment (n = 3) with two successive crops and five harvests in total. Biochar was applied at rates of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 Mg ha-1 and splits of nitrogen (N) fertilizer were added in the form of urea (1010 kg N in total). References without biochar and N fertilization were included. Biochar significantly decreased the cumulative annual N2O emissions by 34-67%, which concurred with decreased denitrification enzyme activity and increased nosZ gene abundance in the vegetable soil. The absolute N2O mitigation increased with increasing flux rates, which were positively correlated to soil temperature and water-filled pore space. Conversely, weak increases of N2O emissions were recurrently induced by biochar when the soil temperature was lower than 20 degrees C and the absolute fluxes were low. A significant 17-29% increase in vegetable yield was induced by biochar, which also ameliorated soil fertility by increasing the soil carbon content and the cation exchange capacity. Overall, biochar significantly decreased the yield-scaled N2O emissions by 44-71% with the lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions for the intermediate biochar application rate of 20 Mg ha(-1). Higher biochar application rates failed to further decrease the yield-scaled N2O emissions, but rather caused weak increases. Based on the present results, a biochar application rate of 20 Mg ha(-1) combined with N fertilization seemed to be recommendable to achieve highest vegetable yield with lowest N2O emissions in intensive vegetable production in South China.

Trade-off between soil organic carbon sequestration and nitrous oxide emissions fromwinter wheat-summer maize rotations: Implications of a 25-year fertilization experiment in Northwestern China. The primary aims of this study were to (i) quantify the variations in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates under winter wheat-summer maize cropping systems in Guanzhong Plain and (ii) evaluate the impact of organic amendments on greenhouse gasmitigation over a long-term period. We measured N2O fluxes during the maize season in 2015 under four fertilizer regimes in a long-term fertilization experiment. Soil was treated with only synthetic fertilizers in the maize season and with synthetic fertilizers, synthetic fertilizers plus crop residues and synthetic fertilizers plus low and high levels of dairy manure in the winter wheat season from 1990. The SOC content (0-20 cm) was collected annually at the same site between 1990 and 2015. Synthesis of our measurements and previous observations (between 2000 and 2009) within the investigated agricultural landscape revealed that cumulative N2O emissions increased with the SOC content following natural logarithm models during both the maize and winter wheat seasons (r(2) > 0.77, p < 0.001), implying a trade-off between N2O emissions and SOC sequestration. The SOC content increased under all fertilizer regimes, and the dynamics were well fitted by the linear and logistic regression models (r(2) > 0.74, p < 0.001), indicating that all the fertilizer treatments in this study sequestered SOC. By applying these regression models, we estimated that the twomanure-amended treatments accumulated a negative global warming potential (ranging from - 1.9 to - 12.9 t CO2-equivalent ha(-1)) over the past 25 years. However, this benefit would most likely be offset by high N2O emissions at saturated SOC levels before 2020. Our estimates suggest that organic amendments may not be efficient for greenhouse gas mitigation in Guanzhong Plain over a long-term period. We recommend efforts to inhibit N2O production via denitrification as being critical to resolving the conflict between SOC sequestration and N2O emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The two arable soils had similar rates of carbon mineralization in the laboratory at 22 degrees C (basal respiration) as well as in situ (carbon dioxide emission) at field temperature.

In contrast, the biomass-specific ammonification rate was low in wet grassland soil, as were in situ N2O emission rates. Data from all sites together revealed no general relationship between microbial biomass content and C and N mineralization rates. In addition, there was no general relationship between the quantity of soil microbial biomass and the emission rates of the greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O. The maize monoculture induced a soil microbial community that was less efficient in using organic carbon compounds, as shown by the high metabolic quotient (respiration rate per unit of biomass). However, microbial biomass content was proportional to basal respiration rate in soils under crop rotation, dry and wet grassland. Arginine ammonification rate was related to microbial biomass content only in fertilized soils. Applications of high quantities of inorganic nitrogen and farmyard manure apparently increase in situ N2O emission rates, particularly under crop rotation. The microbial biomass in the unfertilized wet grassland soil seems to be a sink for nitrogen. C1 GSF FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM UMWELT & GESUNDHEIT GMBH,INST BODENOKOL,D-85758 OBERSCHLEISSHEIM,GERMANY.

Variation in N2O emission and N2O related microbial functional genes in straw- and biochar-amended and non-amended soils. Reducing mineral fertilizer application is an important management practice for mitigating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Crop straw and biochar are two farmer-friendly residues that can be used for reducing the application of mineral fertilizers. However, different effect of straw- and biochar-amended and non-amended soils on N2O emissions is not well understood. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment in a vegetable field in Southwestern China using four treatments: control (CT, no addition), solely mineral fertilizers at the recommended dosage (F), maize straw with mineral fertilizers (SF), and biochar with mineral fertilizers (BF), based on the same total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents. Soil N2O fluxes, cumulative N2O emission, soil chemical parameters, the abundance of N2O related microbial functional genes (amoA, nirS, nirK and nosZ) and microbial community structure were monitored and analyzed. Compared to F, the SF treatment increased the cumulative N2O emission. However, no significant difference was observed in cumulative N2O emission between F and BF treatments. Covariation in cumulative N2O emission and soil dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content indicated that heterotrophic ammonia oxidation fueled by soil DON might be the driving force for N2O production. Compared to F, both SF and BF treatments increased the amoA gene copy numbers of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) but reduced those of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA); nirS and nosZ gene copy numbers were also reduced under SF and BF treatments. Compared to SF, the diversity of nirK and nosZ communities under the BF treatment was increased, whereas the diversity of nirS community was decreased. Lower cumulative N2O emission under BF than that under SF may be attributed to lower N2O production from heterotrophic ammonia oxidation fueled by soil DON and increased N2O consumption mediated by nosZ-harboring denitrifiers.

The contribution of maize cropping in the Midwest USA to global warming: A regional estimate. Agricultural soils emit about 50% of the global flux of N2O attributable to human influence, mostly in response to nitrogen fertilizer use. Recent evidence that the relationship between N2O fluxes and N-fertilizer additions to cereal maize are non-linear provides an opportunity to estimate regional N2O fluxes based on estimates of N application rates rather than as a simple percentage of N inputs as used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We combined a simple empirical model of N2O production with the SOCRATES soil carbon dynamics model to estimate N2O and other sources of Global Warming Potential (GWP) from cereal maize across 19,000 cropland polygons in the North Central Region (NCR) of the US over the period 1964-2005. Results indicate that the loading of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere from cereal maize production in the NCR was 1.7 Gt CO(2)e, with an average 268 t CO(2)e produced per tonne of grain. From 1970 until 2005, GHG emissions per unit product declined on average by 2.8 t CO(2)e ha(-1) annum(-1), coinciding with a stabilisation in N application rate and consistent increases in grain yield from the mid-1970's. Nitrous oxide production from N fertilizer inputs represented 59% of these emissions, soil C decline (0-30 cm) represented 11% of total emissions, with the remaining 30% (517 Mt) from the combustion of fuel associated with farm operations. Of the 126 Mt of N fertilizer applied to cereal maize from 1964 to 2005, we estimate that 2.2 Mt N was emitted as N2O when using a non-linear response model, equivalent to 1.75% of the applied N.

Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from dung patches deposited by grazing cattle supplemented with maize grain. Feeding management represents an opportunity to improve cattle performance in grazing-based production systems and to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock production. However, it is unclear how diet affects GHG emissions from dung patches left by grazing cattle. In this study, we evaluated the impact of supplementing the diet of grazing beef steers with maize grain on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from dung patches, and estimated the corresponding emission factors (EF). Gas fluxes from dung and soil were monitored over 125 days, using the static chamber technique. Dung from supplemented grazing steers produced significantly lower CH4 and higher N2O emissions (1.7 g CH4-C/m(2) and 0.4 g N2O-N/m(2)) than dung from non-supplemented steers (4.0 g CH4-C/m(2) and 0.1 g N2O-N/m(2)). Total GHG emissions from dung showed a tendency to be lower with maize grain supplementation (47.8 and 63.5 +/- 5.9 g CO2eq/head/d for supplemented and non-supplemented steers, respectively). The EF values (0.8 g CH4/kg volatile solids (VS) and 0.09 % N2O) were lower than the default values established by IPCC (2006), but comparable to those established by IPCC (2019). Thus, the IPCC (2019) EF values should be used for GHG inventories in the study region (Argentina) until more region-specific values are obtained. Using local data, this study showed that supplementing the diet of grazing steers can reduce dung GHG emissions. Further studies are needed to assess the full implications of dietary supplementation on GHG emissions at farm level.

The annual emission amount of N2O was 1.70 kg N2O ha(-1), but that in flooding period was only 0.04 kg N2O ha(-1). Daily average and seasonal total CH4 emission in rice field were 0.07 and 7.40 g CH(4)m(-2), respectively. A trade-off between N2O and CH4 emissions from rice field was found. The growth of Azolla in rice field greatly stimulated both N2O and CH4 emissions. Total N2O emissions (270 days) from maize and soybean fields were 7.10 and 3.12 kg N2O ha(-1), respectively.

Effects of Conservation Agriculture on Soil N2O Emissions and Crop Yield in Global Cereal Cropping Systems. Conservation agriculture, which involves minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover, and crop rotation, has been widely adopted as a sustainable agricultural practice globally. However, the effects of conservation agriculture practices on soil N2O emissions and crop yield vary based on geography, management methods, and the duration of implementation, which has hindered its widespread scientific application. In this study, we assessed the impacts of no-tillage (NT), both individually and in combination with other conservation agriculture principles, on soil N2O emissions and crop yields worldwide, based on 1270 observations from 86 peer-reviewed articles. Our results showed that conservation agriculture practices significantly increased crop yield by 9.1% while significantly reducing soil N2O emissions by 6.8% compared to conventional tillage (CT). These mitigation effects were even greater when NT was combined with other conservation agriculture principles, such as crop residue retention and crop rotation, leading to reductions in N2O emissions of over 15% and yield increases of more than 30%. Additionally, conservation agriculture was more effective at mitigating soil N2O emissions in dry climates compared to humid regions. Long-term adoption of conservation agriculture practices was found to reduce soil N2O emissions by up to 26% without compromising crop yields. Smallholder farm in Central Asia, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa appear particularly suitable for the adoption of conservation agriculture, whereas, in humid climates, high nitrogen (N) input management and silt-clay loam soil should be applied with caution. Overall, conservation agriculture holds significant potential for mitigating soil N2O emissions while enhancing grain yields in cereal cropping systems.

Nitrous oxide emissions following seasonal freeze-thaw events from arable soils in Northeast China. Seasonal soil freeze-thaw events may enhance soil nitrogen transformation and thus stimulate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in cold regions. However, the mechanisms of soil N2O emission during the freeze-thaw cycling in the field remain unclear. We evaluated N2O emissions and soil biotic and abiotic factors in maize and paddy fields over 20 months in Northeast China, and the structural equation model (SEM) was used to determine which factors affected N2O production during non-growing season. Our results verified that the seasonal freeze-thaw cycles mitigated the available soil nitrogen and carbon limitation during spring thawing period, but simultaneously increased the gaseous N2O-N losses at the annual time scale under field condition. The N2O-N cumulative losses during the non-growing season amounted to 0.71 and 0.55 kg N ha(-1) for the paddy and maize fields, respectively, and contributed to 66 and 18% of the annual total. The highest emission rates (199.2-257.4 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) were observed during soil thawing for both fields, but we did not observe an emission peak during soil freezing in early winter. Although the pulses of N2O emission in spring were short-lived (18 d), it resulted in approximately 80% of the non-growing season N2O-N loss. The N2O burst during the spring thawing was triggered by the combined impact of high soil moisture, flush available nitrogen and carbon, and rapid recovery of microbial biomass. SEM analysis indicated that the soil moisture, available substrates including NH4+ and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) explained 32, 36, 16 and 51% of the N2O flux variation, respectively, during the non-growing season. Our results suggested that N2O emission during the spring thawing make a vital contribution of the annual nitrogen budget, and the vast seasonally frozen and snow-covered croplands will have high potential to exert a positive feedback on climate change considering the sensitive response of nitrogen biogeochemical cycling to the freeze-thaw disturbance.

Nitrogen dynamics and nitrous oxide emissions in a long-term trial on integrated soil fertility management in Western Kenya. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) is a concept that includes the management of organic matter in smallholder farming systems for sustainable intensification. To determine whether ISFM is also eco-efficient, we measured and simulated nitrogen (N)-dynamics and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in an ISFM long-term maize trial in Western Kenya. The total annual N-balance averaged over 10.5 years was negative for all continuous maize treatments that received only inorganic N-fertilizer. The N-balance was zero or positive when maize was grown in rotation with the green manure cover crop, Tephrosia candid, and/or to which 4 Mg ha(-1) sea-son(-1) farm yard manure (FYM) added. These results thus substantiate the importance of organic matter management in tropical ecosystems. They also underpin that mineral N-fertilizer application alone does not guarantee agro-ecosystem sustainability, which should be considered in fertilizer (subsidy) policies. Treatments that included Tephrosia and FYM application emitted the largest amounts of N2O. Highest emissions (12.0 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) were simulated for the maize-Tephrosia rotation to which FYM and 30 kg ha(-1) of mineral fertilizer N was added and 2 Mg ha(-1) maize stovers retained. Such treatments had the highest N-emission intensity. The slope of the linear regression equation describing the N2O emission-N-input relationship of all considered treatments (0.023) was twice as high as the IPCC-Tier-1 emission factor. Maize-Tephrosia treatments had the highest seasonal maize yields. These were, however, not high enough to compensate for the inclusion of Tephrosia into the system as compared to growing maize continuously, compromising adoption by smallholder farmers.

Net N2O and CH4 soil fluxes of annual and perennial bioenergy crops in two central German regions. The area used for bioenergy feedstock production is increasing because substitution of fossil fuels by bioenergy is promoted as an option to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, agriculture itself contributes to rising atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) concentrations. In this study we tested whether the net exchanges of N2O and CH4 between soil and atmosphere differ between annual fertilized and perennial unfertilized bioenergy crops. We measured N2O and CH4 soil fluxes from poplar short rotation coppice (SRC), perennial grass-clover and annual bioenergy crops (silage maize, oilseed rape, winter wheat) in two central German regions for two years. In the second year after establishment, the N2O emissions were significantly lower in SRC (<0.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) than grassland (0.8 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and the annual crop (winter wheat; 1.5 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) at one regional site (Reiffenhausen). However, a different trend was observed in the first year when contents of mineral nitrogen were still higher in SRC due to former cropland use. At the other regional site (Gierstadt), N2O emissions were generally low (<0.5.kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and no crop-type effects were detected. Net uptake of atmospheric CH4 varied between 0.4 and 1.2 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) with no consistent crop-type effect. The N2O emissions related to gross energy in the harvested biomass ranged from 0.07 to 6.22 kg CO2 equ GJ(-1). In both regions, Gierstadt (low N2O emissions) and more distinct Reiffenhausen (medium N2O emissions), this energy yield-related N2O emission was the lowest for SRC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Fertilizer and water management practices have short- and long-term effects on soil chemical and physical properties and, in turn, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The goal of this 4-yr field study was to establish the relationships between soil properties, agronomic practices, and GHG (CO2 and N2O) emissions under different fertilizer and water table management practices. There were two fertilizer treatments: inorganic fertilizer (IF) and a mix of solid cattle manure and inorganic fertilizer (SCM), combined with tile drainage(DR) and controlled drainage with subirrigation(CDS). The cropping system was a maize (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. Nitrogen in biomass (BMN) and N in grain (GRN) were measured and used to calculate other plant N parameters. Nitrous oxide and CO2 fluxes were collected weekly, and their respective cumulative emissions were calculated. The results show that soil organic matter (OM), soil total carbon (C), and soil total nitrogen (N) were greater in SCM than IF by 23.7, 35.2, and 24.4%, respectively. Water table management did not significantly affect soil N and C. Increased CO2 emissions were witnessed under higher soil OM, soil total C, and total N. Plant N uptake parameters were negatively correlated with N2O and CO2 emissions. Higher plant N uptake can reduce environmental pollution by limiting N2O and CO2 emissions.

Nitrous oxide fluxes over establishing biofuel crops: Characterization of temporal variability using the cross-wavelet analysis. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) over croplands are a major source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The precise accounting of sources of N2O is essential to national and global budgets, as well as the understanding of the spatial and temporal relationships with environmental variables such as rainfall, air and soil temperature, and soil moisture. The objective of this work was to investigate the temporal correlations of N2O fluxes with soil and air temperatures, as well as soil moisture. N2O fluxes were measured over four biofuel crops in Central Illinois during their establishment phase. Measurements were carried out from 2009 to 2011 using a trace gas analyzer (TGA) with tunable laser technology. Measurements of concentrations of N2O and CO(2)were taken at the center of four plots of maize/soybean rotation, miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and a mixture of native prairie plants. Cumulative fluxes indicate an average emission of nitrogen via N2O fluxes on the order of 1.5 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), in agreement with chamber measurements previously reported for the site. N2O fluxes were associated with peaks in soil and air temperature, and soil moisture, particularly during spring and winter thaws. Cross-wavelet analysis was used to investigate the correlation between N2O fluxes and those variables. Results indicate that N2O fluxes and meteorological variables have significant covariance in time scales ranging from 4 to 32 days. In addition, temporal delays of 1-8 days were found in those relationships. Cross-wavelet patterns were similar when relating N2O fluxes with soil temperature, air temperature and soil moisture. The temporal patterns of fluxes and environmental variables reported here support the modeling of emissions and highlight the importance of considering the timing of fluxes in relation to trends in meteorological variables.

High pyrolysis temperature biochars reduce nitrogen availability and nitrous oxide emissions from an acid soil. Biochar-bioenergy coproduction from biomass pyrolysis has the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation. Biochar produced at various pyrolysis temperatures (<600 degrees C) has been widely studied. However, the effect of biochars, produced at high pyrolysis temperature (>= 600 degrees C), on soil nitrogen (N) dynamics and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission is largely unknown. A pot trial was performed to examine the effect of high pyrolysis temperature (600, 700, 850 and 950 degrees C) woody biochars on soil N dynamics, microbial gene abundance and N2O emissions with (+N) and without N (-N) fertilization from an acid soil. Results showed that all biochar treatments significantly lowered the N2O emissions in both fertilized and unfertilized regimes. However, the suppressive effect on N2O emission among different high pyrolysis temperatures was not statistically different. Biochar amendment significantly decreased the concentration of soil NH4+, and lower levels of soil NO3- were observed at the later stage of experiment. Under -N, plant biomass and N uptake were significantly lowered in all biochar treatments. Under +N, biochar addition significantly increased plant biomass, while only the 700 degrees C biochar significantly increased N uptake. This suggests that single application of biochar could limit soil mineral N bioavailability and further decrease plant growth and N uptake in the plant-soil system. Biochar amendments tended to increase nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) gene abundance, but this effect was only significant for biochar produced at 950 degrees C under +N. In conclusion, high pyrolysis temperature biochars can be effectively used to reduce N2O emission, while increases in nosZ gene abundance and decreases in NH4+ and NO3- concentrations in the acid soil are likely to be responsible for the reduction in N2O emission. Thus, woody biochars as a by-product produced at high pyrolysis temperature have the potential to mitigate soil N2O emission via modifying N transformation and further affect climate change.

NITROUS-OXIDE PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR FROM FERTILIZED AND MANURED MAIZE FIELDS. Two field sites on a loam soil were established to monitor N2O concentration in the soil atmosphere and rate of emission from the soil surface. The sites were cropped to maize (Zea mays L.) and managed at two high-N levels (181 or 237 kg N ha-1). Both sites received 168 kg N ha-1 as feedlot cattle (Bos taurus) manure (preplant-incorporated) and 13 kg N ha-1 as NH4NO3 fertilizer in the row at planting. One site (Site B) received additional soil-incorporated N (56 kg N ha-1) as urea. Flucturations in N2O emissions from the two sites were temporally similar, and differed only in magnitude with Site A (no additional fertilizer), emitting about 3.6 kg N20-N ha-1 yr-1 and Site B about 5.2 kg N2)-N ha-1 yr-1, or about 2% of the N applied. Most of the N2O was emitted between mid-June and the end of July when the soil was warm and NH4+-N was present, and at spring thaw (late March the following year) when soils wee cold and near water-saturated. High N2O emissions during the growing season occurred following precipitation events, and hence were associated with high soil water and probably with the initiation of soil drying. Nitrous oxide production was continuous during winter months, presumably a result of denitrification. The N2O concentration in the profile of the frozen soil increased to high levels (nearly 2000 .mu.L L-1 N2O at Site B) before spring thaw. At thaw, nearly 330 d after application of the N amendments, an apparent physical release period occurred and N2O flux was far higher (about 50 g N2O-N ha-1 d-1) than at most times during the growing season.

Greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, N2O and CH4) of pea and maize during two cropping seasons: Drivers, budgets, and emission factors for nitrous oxide. Agriculture contributes considerably to the increase of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Hence, magnitude and drivers of temporal variations in carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in croplands are urgently needed to develop sustainable, climate-smart agricultural practices. However, our knowledge of GHG fluxes from croplands is still very limited. The eddy covariance technique was used to quantify GHG budgets and N2O emis-sion factors (EF) for pea and maize in Switzerland. The random forest technique was applied for gap-filling N2O and CH4 fluxes as well as to determine the relevance of environmental, vegetation vs. management drivers of the GHG fluxes during two cropping seasons. Environmental (i.e., net radiation, soil water content, soil temperature) and veg-etation drivers (i.e., vegetation height) were more important drivers for GHG fluxes at field scale than time since man-agement for the two crop species. Both crops acted as GHG sinks between sowing and harvest, clearly dominated by net CO2 fluxes, while CH4 emissions were negligible. However, considerable N2O emissions occurred in both crop fields early in the season when crops were still establishing. N2O fluxes in both crops were small later in the season when vegetation was tall, despite high soil water contents and temperatures. Results clearly show a strong and highly dynamic microbial-plant competition for N driving N2O fluxes at the field scale. The total loss was 1.4 kg N2O-N ha-1 over 55 days for pea and 4.8 kg N2O-N ha-1 over 127 days for maize. EFs of N2O were 1.5 % (pea) and 4.4 % (maize) during the cropping seasons, clearly exceeding the IPCC Tier 1 EF for N2O. Thus, sustainable, climate-smart agriculture needs to consider crop phenology and better adapt N supply to crop N demand for growth, particularly during the early cropping season when competition for N between establishing crops and soil microorganisms modulates N2O losses.

Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are the primary N2O producers in long-time tillage and fertilization of dryland calcareous soil. Human intervention in agriculture, such as tillage and fertilization, could result in major changes of N2O emissions that understanding the N2O emission mechanism is of great significance in reducing the N2O emissions of the agricultural system. In this work, we focused on the conventional tillage practice and straw return practice used in the spring maize production system of this region and compared them by the addition of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to explore the N2O emission mechanism of the farmland. Compared with conventional farming, straw return significantly increased the N2O emissions from the soil. Soil pH had important effects on soil N2O emissions through its influence on the ammonia oxidizer community. In addition, DMPP was used to distinguish N2O emissions driven by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and the results showed that AOB were the dominant factor regulating N2O emissions after receiving nitrogen from an external source in dryland farming calcareous soil. Through the analyses of soil AOB community composition and the aggregated boosted tree (ABT) model for N2O emissions, Nitrosospira Cluster 3a.2 was found to be the main driving force of soil N2O emissions in AOB communities. These findings will help better understand the physiochemical and biological mechanisms underlying the N2O emissions of agricultural soils and provide insight for reducing the negative impact of agricultural production systems on the ecological environment.

Temporal integration of soil N2O fluxes: validation of IPNOA station automatic chamber prototype. The assessment of nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from agricultural soil surfaces still poses a major challenge to the scientific community. The evaluations of integrated soil fluxes of N2O are difficult owing to their lower emissions when compared with CO2. These emissions are also sporadic as environmental conditions act as a limiting factor. A station prototype was developed to integrate annual N2O andCO(2) emissions using an automatic chamber technique and infrared spectrometers within the LIFE project (IPNOA: LIFE11 ENV/IT/00032). It was installed from June 2014 to October 2015 in an experimental maize field in Tuscany. The detection limits for the fluxes were evaluated up to 1.6 ng N-N2O m(2) s(-1) and 0.3 mu g CCO2 m(2) s(-1). A cross-comparison carried out in September 2015 with the Bmobile IPNOA prototype<^>; a highsensibility transportable instrument already validated provided evidence of very similar values and highlighted flux assessment limitations according to the gas analyzers used. The permanent monitoring device showed that temporal distribution of N2O fluxes can be very large and discontinuous over short periods of less than 10 days and that N2O fluxes were below the detection limit of the instrumentation during approximately 70% of the measurement time. The N2O emission factors were estimated to 1.9% in 2014 and 1.7% in 2015, within the range of IPCC assessments. C1 [Laville, P.] INRA, UMR Ecosys, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.

Nitrous oxide emission and mitigation from maize-wheat rotation in the upper Indo-Gangetic Plains. Due to its lower water requirement, methane emission and soil degradation, a maize-wheat rotation (MWR) may be a more attractive alternative to rice-wheat rotation (RWR), in the upper Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) of India. However, N2O emission from MWR needs to be quantified to propose management practices for N2O mitigation. A field experiment was conducted at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-IARI), New Delhi, to assess the impacts of various N sources on N2O emission and its mitigation from the MWR. Six treatments -N0 (control), urea, urea + farmyard manure (FYM), FYM, urea + nitrification inhibitor (NI) and neem oil coated urea (NOCU) were investigated during 2012-2014. Results show ranges of N2O-N emissions from MWR of 0.59-0.69, 1.82-1.86, 1.81-1.85, 1.71-1.77, 1.38-1.52, 1.57-1.61 during 2012-2013, and of 0.62-0.68, 1.86-1.90, 1.78-1.84, 1.72-1.76, 1.40-1.46, 1.52-1.60 during 2013-2014, for N0, urea, urea + FYM, FYM, urea + NI and NOCU treatments, respectively. The 2-year pooled N2O-N emission of MWR decreased by 23% in urea + NI and by 16% in NOCU with higher grain yield as compared to conventional urea application. Application of FYM with urea and FYM alone also reduced N2O-N emission; however, the grain yields of these treatments were decreased. Thus, the study suggests that the application of NOCU and NI with urea can mitigate N2O-N emissions from the maize and wheat crops. Hence, the use of NOCU and application of NI with urea could be a better option to mitigate N2O-N emissions from MWR of the upper IGP of India.

Association of Earthworm-Denitrifier Interactions with Increased Emission of Nitrous Oxide from Soil Mesocosms Amended with Crop Residue. Earthworm activity is known to increase emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from arable soils. Earthworm gut, casts, and burrows have exhibited higher denitrification activities than the bulk soil, implicating priming of denitrifying organisms as a possible mechanism for this effect. Furthermore, the earthworm feeding strategy may drive N2O emissions, as it determines access to fresh organic matter for denitrification. Here, we determined whether interactions between earthworm feeding strategy and the soil denitrifier community can predict N2O emissions from the soil. We set up a 90-day mesocosm experiment in which N-15-labeled maize (Zea mays L.) was either mixed in or applied on top of the soil in the presence or absence of the epigeic earthworm Lumbricus rubellus and/or the endogeic earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa. We measured N2O fluxes and tested the bulk soil for denitrification enzyme activity and the abundance of 16S rRNA and denitrifier genes nirS and nosZ through real-time quantitative PCR. Compared to the control, L. rubellus increased denitrification enzyme activity and N2O emissions on days 21 and 90 (day 21, P = 0.034 and P = 0.002, respectively; day 90, P = 0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively), as well as cumulative N2O emissions (76%; P = 0.014). A. caliginosa activity led to a transient increase of N2O emissions on days 8 to 18 of the experiment. Abundance of nosZ was significantly increased (100%) on day 90 in the treatment mixture containing L. rubellus alone. We conclude that L. rubellus increased cumulative N2O emissions by affecting denitrifier community activity via incorporation of fresh residue into the soil and supplying a steady, labile carbon source.

Modeling impacts of farming management practices on greenhouse gas emissions in the oasis region of China. Agricultural ecosystems are major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). An important method of investigating GHG emissions in agricultural ecosystems is model simulation. Field measurements quantifying N2O and CO2 fluxes were taken in a summer maize ecosystem in Zhangye City, Gansu Province, in northwestern China in 2010. Observed N2O and CO2 fluxes were used for validating flux predictions by a DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model. Then sensitivity tests on the validated DNDC model were carried out on three variables: climatic factors, soil properties and agricultural management. Results indicated that: (1) the factors that N2O emissions were sensitive to included nitrogen fertilizer application rate, manure amendment and residue return rate; (2) CO2 emission increased with increasing manure amendment, residue return rate and initial soil organic carbon (SOC); and (3) net global warming potential (GWP) increased with increasing N fertilizer application rate and decreased with manure amendment, residue return rate and precipitation increase. Simulation of the long-term impact on SOC, N2O and net GWP emissions over 100 yr of management led to the conclusion that increasing residue return rate is a more efficient method of mitigating GHG emission than increasing fertilizer N application rate in the study area.

Oxygen Regulates Nitrous Oxide Production Directly in Agricultural Soils. Oxygen (O-2) plays a critical and yet poorly understood role in regulating nitrous oxide (N2O) production in well-structured agricultural soils. We investigated the effects of in situ O-2 dynamics on N2O production in a typical intensively managed Chinese cropping system under a range of environmental conditions (temperature, moisture, ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and so forth). Climate and management (fertilization, irrigation, precipitation, and temperature), and their interactions significantly affected soil O-2 and N2O concentrations (P < 0.05). Soil O-2 concentration was the most significant factor correlating with soil N2O concentration (r = -0.71) when compared with temperature, water-filled pore space, and ammonium concentration (r = 0.30, 0.25, and 0.26, respectively). Soil N2O concentration increased exponentially with decreasing soil O-2 concentrations. The exponential model of N treatments and fertilization with irrigation/precipitation events predicted 74-90% and 58% of the variance in soil N2O concentrations, respectively. Our results highlight that the soil O-2 status is the proximal, direct, and the most decisive environmental trigger for N2O production, outweighing the effects of other factors and could be a key variable integrating the aggregated effects of various complex interacting variables. This study offers new opportunities for developing more sensitive approaches to predicting and through appropriate management interventions mitigating N2O emissions from agricultural soils.

Turning point of direct N2O emissions in China's croplands dominated by reduced fertilizer usage since 2015. Large amounts of nitrogen fertilizers have been applied into China's croplands to ensure adequate crop production, leading to massive direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from cropland soils. Since 1980, the agricultural direct N2O emissions in China have shown sustained and impressive growth, associated with the expansion of croplands and intensified fertilization practices. However, it remains uncertain how direct N2O emissions have responded to recent agricultural policies characterized by reducing N fertilizer use and adjusting crop mix. This lack of clarity limits practical insights into the effectiveness of these policies. To fill this gap, we here provided a more detailed and timely assessment of crop-specific N2O emissions during 1980-2022 based on a comprehensive N2O-emission factor dataset and the random forest algorithm. The resulting estimation exhibited a longterm average of 174.7 Gg N2O-N yr-1, with 46 % of it contributed by staple crops (rice, maize and wheat) and 44 % from three cash crops (vegetables, fruit and tea). The temporal sequences revealed a noticeable increase over 1980-2015, peaking in 2015 at 259.9 Gg N2O-N yr-1, followed by a subsequent decline to 215.3 Gg N2O-N yr-1 by 2022. The divergent trends of N2O emissions were observed countrywide, with the turning point at 2015 recognized across more than three-quarter croplands. N application was identified as the fundamental driver for this temporal trajectory, especially the decline after 2015. This study affirms the great environmental benefits from the actions targeted at reducing fertilizer usage and enhancing efficiency since 2015. It also provides valuable insights for estimating and mitigating global N2O emissions from croplands.

Effect of Organic Fertilizer on N2O Emission in Yellow Cornfield. The experiment was conducted to explore the impact of different environmental factors on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission flux after application of fertilizer. An experiment was conducted in 2016 to determine the N2O emissions in maize yellow soil. There were four treatments: no fertilizer (CK); common fertilizer (CF); chemical fertilizer + organic fertilizer (OF); fertilizer + bio-organic fertilizer (BF). Therefore, the experiment was designed to study N2O emission characteristics and environmental factors after application of organic fertilizer. The results indicated that N2O emissions reached three peaks in corn-growing season. An average N2O emission flux of the four treatment process could be ranked as OF>BF>CF>CK, which was measured as 0.080, 0.069, 0.010 and 0.007 mg.m(-2) .h(-1) respectively; the total N2O emissions of soil after application of OF and BF were improved for 15 times and 11 times, respectively as compared with CK. According to relevant analysis, N2O emission flux of yellow cornfield was mainly related either to the carbon-nitrogen ratio (P<0.05) in the farmland or to the soil nitrate nitrogen (N) content (P<0.05) after application of organic fertilizer. Moreover, N2O emissions of yellow cornfield were increased after application of OF and BF, and relatively reduced after CF. As a result, the increased N2O emissions were mainly caused by carbon nitrogen ratio and soil nitrate content of cornfield. Therefore, an important way to reduce N2O emissions in cornfield is to control the application of organic fertilizer and carbon nitrogen ratio.

Incorporating straw into intensively farmed cropland soil can reduce N2O emission via inhibition of nitrification and denitrification pathways. Straw incorporation (SI) combined with N fertilizer has been shown to affect soil N2O emission and N-related functional microbes in agriculture. However, the responses of N2O emission, community structure of nitrifiers and denitrifiers and related microbial functional genes to straw management strategies in the winter wheat season in China remain unclear. Here, we conducted a two-season experiment in a winter wheat field in Ningjing County, northern China, to examine four treatments: no fertilizer with (N0S1) and without maize straw (N0S0); N fertilizer with (N1S1) and without maize straw (N1S0), and their effects on N2O emissions, soil chemical parameters, crop yield, as well as the dynamics of nitrifying and denitrifying microbial communities. We found that seasonal N2O emissions decreased by 7.1-11.1% (p < 0.05) in N1S1 as compared to N1S0, without significant difference between N0S1 and N0S0. In combination with N fertilization, SI increased the yield by 2.6-4.3%, altered the microbial community composition, increased Shannon and ACE indexes, and decreased the abundance of AOA (9.2%), AOB (32.2%; p < 0.05), nirS (35.2%; p < 0.05), nirK (21.6%; p < 0.05) and nosZ (19.2%). However, in the absence of N fertilizer, SI promoted the major genera of Nitrosavbrio (AOB), unclassifiied_Gammaproteobacteria, Rhodanobacter (nirS), Sinorhizobium (nirK), which strongly correlated positively with N2O emissions. Thereby, a negative interaction effect between SI and N fertilizer on AOB and nirS emphasized that SI could offset the increase of N2O emission caused by fertilization. Soil moisture and NO3- concentration were the major factors affecting N-related microbial community structure. Our study reveals that SI suppressed N2O emission significantly and simultaneously decreased the abundance of N-related functional genes and altered denitrifying bacterial community composition. We conclude that SI helps to enhance yield and alleviate fertilizer-induced environmental costs in intensively farmed fields in northern China.

Effects of the nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin and the plant growth regulator gibberellic acid on yield-scale nitrous oxide emission in maize fields under hot climatic conditions. Nitrification inhibitors are widely used in agriculture to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and increase crop yield. However, no concrete information on their mitigation of N2O emission is available under soil and environmental conditions as in Pakistan. A field experiment was established using a silt clay loam soil from Peshawar, Pakistan, to study the effect of urea applied in combination with a nitrification inhibitor, nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-tri-chloromethyl pyridine), and/or a plant growth regulator, gibberellic acid (GA(3)), on N2O emission and the nitrogen (N) uptake efficiency of maize. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with five treatments in four replicates: control with no N (CK), urea (200 kg N ha(-1)) alone, urea in combination with nitrapyrin (700 g ha(-1)), urea in combination with GA(3) (60 g ha(-1)), and urea in combination with nitrapyrin and GA(3). The N2O emission, yield, N response efficiency, and total N uptake were measured during the experimental period. The treatment with urea and nitrapyrin reduced total N2O emission by 39%-43% and decreased yield-scaled N2O emission by 47%-52%, relative to the treatment with urea alone. The maize plant biomass, grain yield, and total N uptake increased significantly by 23%, 17%, and 15%, respectively, in the treatment with urea and nitrapyrin, relative to the treatment with urea alone, which was possibly due to N saving, lower N loss, and increased N uptake in the form of ammonium; they were further enhanced in the treatment with urea, nitrapyrin, and GA(3) by 27%, 36%, and 25%, respectively, probably because of the stimulating effect of GA(3) on plant growth and development and the reduction in biotic and abiotic stresses. These results suggest that applying urea in combination with nitrapyrin and GA(3) has the potential to mitigate N2O emission, improve N response efficiency, and increase maize yield.

Long-term application of organic manure and nitrogen fertilizer on N2O emissions, soil quality and crop production in a sandy loam soil. A long-term field experiment was established to determine the influence of mineral fertilizer (NPK) or organic manure (composed of wheat straw, oil cake and cottonseed cake) on soil fertility. A tract of calcareous fluvo-aquic soil (aquic inceptisol) in the Fengqiu State Key Experimental Station for Ecological Agriculture (Fengqiu county, Henan province, China) was fertilized beginning in September 1989 and N2O emissions were examined during the maize and wheat growth seasons of 2002-2003. The study involved seven treatments: organic manure (OM), half-orgamic manure plus half-fertilizer N (1/2 OMN), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NP (NP), fertilizer NK (NK), fertilizer PK (PK) and control (CK). Manured soils had higher organic C and N contents, but lower pH and bulk densities than soils receiving the various mineralized fertilizers especially those lacking P, indicating that long-term application of manures could efficiently prevent the leaching of applied N from and increase N content in the plowed layer. The application of manures and fertilizers at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) year I significantly increased N2O emissions from 150 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the CK treatment soil to 856 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the OM treatment soil; however, there was no significant difference between the effect of fertilizer and manure on N2O emission. More N2O was released during the 102-day maize growth season than during the 236-day wheat growth season in the N-fertilized soils but not in N-unfertilized soils. N2O emission was significantly affected by soil moisture during the maize growth season and by soil temperature during the wheat growth season. In sum, this study showed that manure added to a soil tested did not result in greater N2O emission than treatment with a N-containing fertilizer, but did confer greater benefits for soil fertility and the environment.

Modeling impacts of mulching and climate change on crop production and N2O emission in the Loess Plateau of China. Covering soils using mulch can increase crop productivity in dryland agriculture. However, there remains large uncertainty regarding impacts of mulching on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, especially under climate change (increases in air temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration and changes in precipitation). In this study, we applied a biogeochemical model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), to predict impacts of different mulching practices on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) yields and N2O emissions under future climate scenarios in the South Loess Plateau of China. When tested against the observed crop yields and N(2)O( )emissions under no-mulching (NM), straw mulching (SM), and plastic film mulching (PM), DNDC successfully simulated crop yields and annual N2O emissions under all treatments. Simulations and observations both suggested that applying SM or PM increased crop yields and N2O emissions in comparison with NM. Sensitivity analyses of crop yields and N2O emissions indicated that the crop yields were primarily influenced by precipitation and N2O emissions were sensitive to changes in air temperature, precipitation, soil organic carbon, and nitrogen application rate. Application of SM or PM reduced the sensitivity of the crop yield and N2O emissions to precipitation change. Compared with historical climate conditions, future climate from 2017 to 2100 significantly increased crop yields except during the 2090s for NM or SM and during the 2070s to 2090s for PM under the high emission scenario (RCP8.5), while N2O emissions were increased under all treatments. The positive impacts of PM on crop yields could be reduced under the RCP8.5 scenario. The DNDC predictions suggest that straw mulching might be an optimum mulching method to improve crop productivity and mitigate increasing N2O under future climate conditions in semi-arid to sub-humid areas such as the South Loess Plateau of China.

This study aimed (1) to evaluate how fresh maize root litter affects N2O emissions compared to fresh maize shoot litter, (2) to assess whether N2O emissions are related to the interaction of C and N mineralization from soil and litter, and (3) to analyze changes in soil microbial community structures related to litter input and N2O emissions. To obtain root and shoot litter, maize plants (Zea mays L.) were cultivated with two N fertilizer levels in a greenhouse and harvested. A two-factorial 22 d laboratory incubation experiment was set up with soil from both N levels (N1, N2) and three litter addition treatments (control, root, root C shoot). We measured CO2 and N2O fluxes, analyzed soil mineral N and water-extractable organic C (WEOC) concentrations, and determined quality parameters of maize litter. Bacterial community structures were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Maize litter quality controlled NO3- and WEOC availability and decomposition-related CO2 emissions. Emissions induced by maize root litter remained low, while high bioavailability of maize shoot litter strongly increased CO2 and N2O emissions when both root and shoot litter were added. We identified a strong positive correlation between cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions, supporting our hypothesis that litter quality affects denitrification by creating plant-litter-associated anaerobic microsites. The interdependency of C and N availability was validated by analyses of regression. Moreover, there was a strong positive interaction between soil NO3- and WEOC concentration resulting in much higher N2O emissions, when both NO3- and WEOC were available. A significant correlation was observed between total CO2 and N2O emissions, the soil bacterial community composition, and the litter level, showing a clear separation of root + shoot samples of all remaining samples. Bacterial diversity decreased with higher N level and higher input of easily available C. Altogether, changes in bacterial community structure reflected degradability of maize litter with easily degradable C from maize shoot litter favoring fast-growing C-cycling and N-reducing bacteria of the phyla Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. In conclusion, litter quality is a major driver of N2O and CO2 emissions from crop residues, especially when soil mineral N is limited.

Effect of split application of nitrogen on nitrous oxide emissions from plastic mulching maize in the semiarid Loess Plateau. Applying nitrogen (N) using split application to improve temporal synchronicity between crop-N demand and soil-N availability is a key strategy for improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Its effect on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions has not been well evaluated, especially from plastic mulching maize (Zea mays L.) in semiarid farmland. We conducted a two-year experiment to investigate the effect of split fertilizer N application on N2O emissions. Three approaches each applying a total of 225 kg N ha(-1) were tested either as a single application at sowing (N1), N applied with two splits at a ratio of 4:6 (N2), and N applied with three splits at a ratio of 4:3:3 (N3), a no-N application treatment was also included as a control (NO). Compared with the single application, split application of N significantly increased the grain yields by 4.7-9.1%. The cumulative N2O emissions significantly increased by 18.1% under the three splits application in the 2014-2015 season compared with the single application but not in the growing season of 2015, which followed the same pattern with yield-scaled N2O emissions. Fertilizer application combined with precipitation was the main driving factor for N2O emissions. Therefore, the higher frequency (three times) of fertilizer application had a high risk for increasing N2O emissions due to the relatively strong and frequent precipitation in maize mid and late growth period in this region; applying N with two splits is more suitable for this region which could produce higher grain yields, and lower risk of N2O emissions.

Substituting Inorganic Fertilizers with Organic Amendment Reduced Nitrous Oxide Emissions by Affecting Nitrifiers' Microbial Community. Excessive inorganic fertilizers are one of the main causes of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Organic fertilizers can not only reduce the use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers by increasing soil organic matter but are also safe for the environment. The partial replacement of nitrogen (N) fertilizers with organic fertilizers can potentially reduce N2O emissions. To illuminate the best ratio for the nitrogen replacement of inorganic fertilizer, the present experiment was conducted in dryland areas of central Gansu Province and different portions of inorganic N fertilizers (200 kg ha(-1)); i.e., 0, 50, 37.5, 25, and 12.5% were replaced with commercial organic fertilizers to test their effects on soil physicochemical properties, the grain yield of maize, N2O emissions, and the diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacterial (AOB) communities. Results showed that the maximum N2O emission was obtained by 100% inorganic fertilizers and the lowest was obtained at the control (no fertilizer). Substituting inorganic fertilizers with organic manure not only reduced N2O emissions but also improved soil organic carbon content and soil moisture and typically improves grain yield and biomass. The highest reduction in N2O emissions was recorded by 50% substitution. Furthermore, 37.5% and 12.5% substitutions did not reduce the grain yield and biomass compared to 100% inorganic fertilizer, and a 37.5% substitution performed better in improving soil fertility. Organic fertilizer increased the amoA copy number of AOA but decreased that of AOB. Nitrososphaera (AOA) and Nitrosospira (AOB) were the most dominant ammonia-oxidizing communities. Structural equation modeling indicated that AOB contributes more N2O emissions than AOA and is more sensitive to changes in pH, moisture, and NO3--N, and the input of organic fertilizers may affect AOB by influencing soil physicochemical traits. In summary, replacing a reasonable proportion (37.5%) of inorganic fertilizers with organic manure improves soil fertility, reduces N2O emissions, and stabilizes production.

Soil Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Response to Corn Stover Removal and Tillage Management Across the US Corn Belt. In-field measurements of direct soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions provide critical data for quantifying the net energy efficiency and economic feasibility of crop residue-based bioenergy production systems. A major challenge to such assessments has been the paucity of field studies addressing the effects of crop residue removal and associated best practices for soil management (i.e., conservation tillage) on soil emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). This regional survey summarizes soil GHG emissions from nine maize production systems evaluating different levels of corn stover removal under conventional or conservation tillage management across the US Corn Belt. Cumulative growing season soil emissions of CO2, N2O, and/or CH4 were measured for 2-5 years (2008-2012) at these various sites using a standardized static vented chamber technique as part of the USDA-ARS's Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices (REAP) regional partnership. Cumulative soil GHG emissions during the growing season varied widely across sites, by management, and by year. Overall, corn stover removal decreased soil total CO2 and N2O emissions by -4 and -7 %, respectively, relative to no removal. No management treatments affected soil CH4 fluxes. When aggregated to total GHG emissions (Mg CO2 eq ha(-1)) across all sites and years, corn stover removal decreased growing season soil emissions by -5 +/- 1 % (mean +/- se) and ranged from -36 % to 54 % (n = 50). Lower GHG emissions in stover removal treatments were attributed to decreased C and N inputs into soils, as well as possible microclimatic differences associated with changes in soil cover. High levels of spatial and temporal variabilities in direct GHG emissions highlighted the importance of site-specific management and environmental conditions on the dynamics of GHG emissions from agricultural soils.

Increased expression of bacterial amoA during an N2O emission peak in an agricultural field. Levels of N-cycle gene transcripts (nirK, nirS, nosZ, amoA) were measured during an N2O emission peak in an agricultural soil. Automated dynamic closed chambers were used to monitor an N2O emission peak on a maize crop after a natural rainfall. The peak occurred rapidly after the rainfall began. Spatial and temporal variability in N2O emission was observed between chambers. An analysis of N-cycle gene transcript levels revealed an increase in bacterial amoA gene transcripts (but not in archaeal amoA transcripts), correlating strongly with N2O emission. This suggests the involvement of nitrification enzymes, despite a high water-filled pore space (80%). Reverse transcription of bacterial 16S rRNA followed by partial sequencing of the resulting cDNAs revealed few rainfall-induced changes in the potentially active bacterial community, and notably no significant change in the relative abundance of 16S rRNAs from the nitrifier genus Nitrosospira. Expression of the amoA gene appears as a possible proxy for monitoring the N2O emission peak. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment to evaluate the expression of N-cycle genes during an N2O emission peak on an agricultural field. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of nitrogen fertilizer application on methane and nitrous oxide emission/uptake in Chinese croplands. The application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer to increase crop yields has a significant influence on soil methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission/uptake. A meta-analysis was carried out on the effect of N application on (i) CH4 emissions in rice paddies, (ii) CH4 uptake in upland fields and (iii) N2O emissions. The responses of CH4 emissions to N application in rice paddies were highly variable and overall no effects were found. CH4 emissions were stimulated at low N application rates (<100 kg N ha(-1)) but inhibited at high N rates (>200 kg N ha(-1)) as compared to no N fertilizer (control). The response of CH4 uptake to N application in upland fields was 15% lower than control, with a mean CH4 uptake factor of 0.001 kg CH4-C kg(-1) N. The mean N2O emission factors were 1.00 and 0.94% for maize (Zea mays) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), respectively, but significantly lower for the rice (Oryza sativa) (0.51%). Compared with controls, N addition overall increased global warming potential of CH4 and N2O emissions by 78%. Our result revealed that response of CH4 emission to N input might depend on the CH4 concentration in rice paddy. The critical factors that affected CH4 uptake and N2O emission were N fertilizer application rate and the controls of CH4 uptake and N2O emission. The influences of application times, cropping systems and measurement frequency should all be considered when assessing CH4 and N2O emissions/uptake induced by N fertilizer.

Nutrient Management Drives the Direction and Magnitude of Nitrous Oxide Flux in Crop Residue-Returned Soil Under Different Soil Moisture. Crop residues as key organic carbon inputs have the potential for soil carbon sequestration. However, previous studies have shown an inconsistent effect of residue return on the direction and magnitude of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. We used a laboratory-based soil incubation study to test the response of N2O emission to crop residue type, soil moisture, and how nutrient management modulates these responses. In this study, we incorporated crop residues with different qualities (wheat, rice, soybean, and maize) at two soil moisture contents {80% field capacity (FC) and 60% FC} and under seven nutrient levels: N0P0K0 (no nutrients), N0PK, N100PK, N150PK, N100PK + manure@ 5 Mg ha(-1), N100PK + biochar@ 5 Mg ha(-1), and N150PK + biochar@ 5 Mg ha(-1). The results demonstrated significant (p < 0.01) differences in the magnitude of N2O emissions among treatments. However, only the interaction effect of residue x nutrient and nutrient x moisture was significant (p < 0.05). N100PK and N150PK at 80% FC mitigated N2O emission by approximately 20% in wheat residue-amended soil (cf. control soil without residue). In contrast, maize residue amendment (cf. control soil) increased N2O emission by 130% under N0P0K0 and 80% FC. Residue effects were negatively correlated with the C:N ratio, and a strong positive correlation (p < 0.01) was obtained between N2O emission and CO2 respiration, labile carbon, mineral N, and residue total nitrogen (TN). When no nutrients were added, N2O emission was higher in residue returned soil. However, cumulative fluxes of N2O decreased by 6-17% when maize and wheat residues (cf. control soil) were applied with nutrients. Negative fluxes of N2O indicating consumption were observed in every treatment after 57 days of incubation and were most pronounced in control soil without residue and nutrients. Decreasing the soil moisture from 80% FC to 60% FC, the N2O consumption rate increased by 6.6 times across residue types and nutrient management. The regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) results showed that residue TN, soil CO2 emission, NO3-N, and labile SOC were the key predictor variables and could explain 82% variability in the soil N2O emission in the Vertisols of Central India. The results suggested that nutrient addition (NPK) could alter the magnitude and direction of soil N2O flux by residue type and soil moisture by influencing the underlying soil microbial processes of the C and N cycle in the Vertisol of subtropical India.

Carbon limits non-linear response of nitrous oxide (N2O) to increasing N inputs in a highly-weathered tropical soil in Sri Lanka. There is growing evidence for a positive non-linear response in N2O emissions where increasing N fertilizer rates critically exceed crop requirements from a range of cropping systems. However, the majority of these studies have been conducted in temperate regions, and it remains unclear if the non-linear response hypothesis can be transferred to tropical regions due to their inherently lower carbon (C) content and fertility. This study assessed the impact of different nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rates in combination with a carbon source (green-waste compost) on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and crop productivity from a maize-soybean rotation in tropical Sri Lanka. Low cation exchange capacity and extremely high rainfall promoted higher annual cumulative N2O emissions than reported from other cropping systems, ranging from 2.4-9.16 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the different fertilizer rates (0 N, 100 N, 220 N, 300 N). The Delta N2O emitted for every additional kilogram of fertilizer N applied (i.e. the marginal N2O emission), declined from similar to 24 g kg(-1) for the first 0-100 kg N applied to 7 g kg(-1) at 300 kg N. This resulted in declining Emission Factors with increasing N rate, as factors other than N limited denitrification. The addition of compost removed this limitation, resulting in constant Delta N2O production rates and Emission Factors with increasing N inputs, suggesting low C availability limited N2O production at high N rates. The study shows that the non-linear response hypothesis might not hold for highly weathered tropical soils, where C availability limits N2O emissions at high N inputs. While the use of compost can be a viable option to increase soil fertility in these highly weathered tropical soils, it needs to be balanced with reduced N fertilizer application rates to avoid elevated losses of N2O.

Optimum fertilizer application rate to ensure yield and decrease greenhouse gas emissions in rain-fed agriculture system of the Loess Plateau. Application of nitrogen (N) can increase the supply of N in soil and, in turn, can lead to higher yield-but also to large increase in emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) if applied in excess. To determine the optimum dose of N for maize planting system, we analysed the relationship between yield and emissions of GHGs at seven levels of N, namely 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 kg ha(-1), using the DNDC (denitrification decomposition) model and maize grown with and without mulching. The model simulated the following variables: maize production; emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4); global warming potential (GWP); and GHG intensity (GHGI). We used data from 1980 to 2013 for a rain-fed region of the Loess Plateau in north-western China and validated the DNDC model against data from field experiments. The model performed well in simulating yield and GHG emissions (Adj.R-2 > 0.61). Under mulching, the average yield of maize was 3.6-12.2 t ha(-1) and the partial factor productivity was 73.1-35.0 kg kg(-1); and both of these were significantly higher 78%-236% than those in the crop without mulching. The emissions of CO2, N2O, and the GWP increased with the increase in the dose of N whereas CH4 emissions remained unaffected by the dose. Mulching increased yields significantly in the north-western region, and the GWP and GHGI were higher mainly in the central and north-western regions. The optimum dose of N for maize grown with mulching ranged between 150 kg ha(-1) and 200 kg ha(-1) and offers the best balance between higher yield and lower emissions. The optimum dose may promote the development of mulched maize and provide a reference standard for dryland agriculture in zones with similar climates elsewhere in the world.

Strategies for nitrogen management to mitigate nitrous oxide and ammonia emissions from maize field while maintaining yields in China: findings from a field experiment and a national meta-analysis. BACKGROUNDScientific fertilization plays a crucial role in addressing food security and mitigating environmental costs. We conducted a two-season field experiment in northwest China and synthesized 151 national studies to quantitatively assess the potentials of N rate, source (controlled-release urea, nitrification inhibitors, urease inhibitors, and manure) and deep placement to simultaneously reduce ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions while maintaining yields.RESULTSField results showed that reducing N rate from 300 to 200 kg N ha-1 resulted in a marginal yield penalty (5.3%) but decreased N2O by 28.2% and NH3 by 17.3%. Literature synthesis identified 180 kg ha-1 as the optimal N rate for 95% yield potential. Deep placement, compared to surface broadcasting, enhanced yield by 2.6% and reduced N2O by 15.3% in field trials, with meta-analysis showing substantial suppression of NH3 (80.5%) and N2O (12.5%). Manure substitution exhibited limited benefits for yield enhancement and N2O mitigation but demonstrated specific efficacy in medium- and coarse-textured soils with low soil organic carbon. Urea plus controlled-release urea performed best from meta-analysis yet its benefit diminished under high rainfall. Urea-nitrification inhibitor blends led to 5.9% higher NH3 and urea-urease inhibitors exerted limited mitigation efficacy on N2O production from field data, with meta-results confirming the risk of urease inhibitors in stimulating NH3. Dual inhibitors worked synergistically to sustain yields and alleviate N losses, especially in alkaline and coarse soils.CONCLUSIONThe combination of using controlled-release fertilizer plus traditional urea mixed with dual inhibitors and deep placement would be an enhanced approach across Chinese maize croplands under all conditions.

Effects of afforestation on soil nitrous oxide emissions in a subtropical montane agricultural landscape: A 3-year field experiment. Afforestation, through the conversion of upland cropland to forest, is of great significance to land use change in montane (hilly) agricultural landscapes worldwide. Such afforestation is Implemented to improve soil and water conservation and facilitate terrestrial carbon sequestration. However, particularly for subtropical and tropical regions, the effects of afforestation on soil N2O emissions have not been well investigated. Therefore, a three-year field experiment was conducted to simultaneously monitor N2O emissions from three paired sites of afforestation with cypress (Cypressus funebris) and adjacent cropland under a wheat-maize rotation system. The experiment was carried out in a subtropical montane agricultural landscape in southwest China. In both forest and cropland ecosystems, the N2O emissions exhibited a pronounced spatial and temporal variability. These variations in N2O emissions can be well explained by the spatiotemporal dynamics of environmental variables, such as soil temperature, WFPS, soil NH4+ or NO3- availability, because these environmental variables correlated significantly with the N 2 0 emissions across different experimental sites and years. The average annual N2O fluxes were 2.69 kg N ha(-1) for cropland and 0.13 kg N ha(-1) for afforestation. It is noteworthy that the annual N2O fluxes for afforestation found in the present study constitute one of the lowest recorded N2O fluxes for unfertilized forest ecosystems globally. Overall, across all experimental sites and years, afforestation with cypress (Cypressus funebris) stands significantly decreased N2O fluxes by over twenty times relative to the adjacent cropland. This outcome suggests that afforestation could be an effective mitigation strategy for soil N2O emissions in a subtropical montane agricultural landscape.

Combining no-till with rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop mitigates nitrous oxide emissions without decreasing yield. No-till (NT) often increases soil carbon (C) sequestration compared with conventional tillage (CT), yet its net effect on N2O emissions is controversial. Cover crops (CCs) adoption is promoted in NT systems because CCs growth curbs nitrate losses via leaching. However, incorporating CC residues into the soil may have positive or negative effects on N2O emissions depending on CC species and agro-ecosystem management. A better understanding of how tillage practices and CC species affect N2O emissions is therefore needed for the development of productive agroecosystems that contribute to climate change mitigation. The objectives of this three-year (2015-2017) field experiment on a Udertic Haplustalf soil in the Po Valley were to compare N2O emissions and crop yield of soybean under NT and CT, and to examine how contrasting residues from two CCs (rye, Secale cereale L. vs hairy vetch, Vicia villosa Roth) affect N2O emissions in NT soybean and maize. We hypothesized that N2O emissions would be lower with NT than with CT and with rye residues than with vetch ones. Nitrous oxide was continuously sampled using automatic chambers during three periods (emergence, N-fixation and maturity) over the soybean-cropping season in 2015 and during the entire cropping maize season in 2017. The DNDC model was calibrated (2015 data) and validated (2017 data), and then used to estimate the annual cumulative N2O emissions in different treatments. Overall, N2O emissions in NT were 40-55% lower than in CT, for both in situ measurements (Period I) and modelled estimations. These differences could be ascribed to the higher water-filled pore space (WFPS) and soil nitrate availability in CT than in NT. No-till also increased SOC content (28%; 0-5 cm) and earthworm abundance (5 times) compared with CT. Within NT systems, N2O emissions were 20-36% lower with rye CC than with vetch CC (P < 0.05), which was a consequence of the lower availability of soil mineral N under rye than under vetch due to the high C/N ratio of rye residues. Yield of soybean and maize under NT was higher with rye CC than with vetch CC. The combination of NT and rye CC that led to the lowest N2O emissions and highest yields should be recommended in the Po Valley region.

A field-scale experiment was conducted in two adjacent grain farms in upstate New York that have both undergone the same management for 20 years. In the conventional field (CNV), inorganic fertilizer was the only nitrogen (N) source, but in the organic fields (ORG), a legume cover crop, red clover (Thfoliutn pratense), was frost-seeded into a winter grain (spelt, Triticum spelta), and then incorporated in spring as a N source for the subsequent maize plants (Zea mays). Measurements of soil properties and N2O emissions were conducted at shoulder and toeslope positions on both CNV and ORG fields in 2012. Based on Principal Component Analysis, landscape position, management regime, and rotation phases explained 67% of the variation in the soil properties; these three major sources of variation in soil properties (principal components) were correlated significantly with seasonal average N2O emissions. Comparable N2O emissions were found from the clover-maize (ORG Cl-M) phase in the ORG field and the bare fallow-maize phase in the CNV field. The spelt-clover phase in the ORG field had the lowest N2O emissions due to low N availability. In the CNV field, seasonal average N2O emissions were driven mainly by the elevated gas fluxes after fertilizer application. High soil moisture and inorganic N pools towards the end of the growing season probably resulted in increased denitrification rates. The impact of landscape position on N2O emissions was mainly found in the CNV field, probably because greater moisture and pH drove greater rates of complete denitrification at toeslope positions. In the ORG Cl-M phase, the seasonal average N2O emissions were dominated by the emission peaks that immediately followed incorporation of clover. Greater clover biomass at shoulder slope positions resulted in greater N2O peaks there, but the position effect was not statistically significant. Our study suggests that ecosystem state factors, such as landscape characteristics, interacted with management practices to impact soil properties, crop growth, and microbial communities and, therefore, had interactive effects on N dynamics, including N2O emissions.

Soybean in rotation with cereals attenuates nitrous oxide emissions as compared with soybean monoculture in the Pampas region. Nitrous oxide (N-N2O) emissions in the agricultural sector represent ca. 25% of total N-N2O emissions on a global scale. In Argentina, information on agricultural emissions is scarce, and thus, N-N2O emissions are estimated by IPCC equations. Most reports in Argentina have estimated N-N2O emissions at crop scale, while few studies estimated emissions at the cropping system scale. Soybean in Argentina is mainly planted as monoculture, though, the inclusion of cereals in crop rotations may modify soil properties associated with N-N2O emissions such as water-filled pore space (%WFPS), soil temperature, or nitrate content. The objectives of this work were to: i) compare N-N2O emissions in crop sequences that include soybean in different proportions; ii) evaluate the impact of these emissions in relation with N inputs (fertilizer + BNF) at the cropping sequence level, and iii) compare these observations with emissions as estimated by the IPCC equation (tier 1). During two years, N-N2O emissions, soil N-NO3-, soil WFPS, and soil temperature were measured biweekly in a long-term experiment under no-tillage in four sequences: i) full-season soybean monoculture (S-S); ii) winter cover crop/soybean (CC/S); iii) double-cropped wheat/soybean - maize (W/S-M), and vi) double-cropped wheat/soybean - winter cover crop/maize (W/S-CC/M). Aboveground biomass, yield (expressed in glucose equivalents), and nitrogen (N) uptake were determined for each crop at harvest. For soybean, additionally to these variables, N derived from biological N fixation (BNF) was determined, as well. N-N2O emissions were scaled to yield and to vegetative biomass. During the two years of this study, cumulated biomass (expressed in glucose equivalents) was significantly lower in S-S and CC/S (29.5 and 36.8 Mg GluEq ha(-1), respectively) than in W/S-M and W/S-CC/M (48.6 and 54.6 Mg GluEq ha 1, respectively). In the same period, exported cumulated N with grains was similar among sequences averaging 277 kg N ha(-1), while the largest cumulated N input (N fertilizer + BNF) was 392 kg N ha(-1) in W/SCC/M, surpassing the other sequences by 100%. N-N2O flux rates were the lowest in W/S-M (7.8 mu g N-N2O m(2)h 1) and the highest in CC/S (19.0 mu g N-N2O m(-2)h(-1)). Therefore, at the cropping sequence level, N-N2O emissions represented on average 0.62% of cumulated N inputs. A multiple regression model indicated that NN2O emissions were more related to soil %WFPS (0-20 cm) and soil temperature (at 10 cm). IPCC direct emission equation (tier 1) overestimated N-N2O emissions for W/S-M and W/S-CC-M. In absolute terms, sequences including cereals showed similar cumulated emissions to S-S, however, when emission were scaled to unit yield or vegetative biomass, sequences that included cereals in the rotation attenuated N-N2O losses.

Arbuscular Mycorrhizae Affect Soil Nitrogen Fertilizer Utilization, Denitrification Functional Genes, and N2O Emissions During Biochar Amendment. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can form symbionts with plant roots, acquire soil nitrogen, and affect nitrous oxide (N2O) production. Biochar, as a soil additive for the management of agricultural soil, affects soil nitrogen (N) utilization and plant growth. However, how AMF regulates soil N unitization, the denitrification process, and N2O emissions in plant-soil systems remains largely unknown, particularly under the biochar amendment. In this study, a microcosm experiment was conducted to investigate the impacts of different mycorrhizal treatments (CK: neither AMF hyphae nor plant roots; AMF: only AMF hyphae; AMF + R: AMF hyphae and plant roots) on plant growth, soil N fertilizer utilization, N2O production and consumption, functional gene abundance, and N2O emission at two biochar addition levels (B0: no biochar; B1: biochar addition rate of 10 g<middle dot>kg-1 soil) in a maize planting soil system. The results revealed that AMF alone and AMF with plant root treatments enhanced the fresh weight of maize plants by 10.15% and 19.23% and decreased soil inorganic N contents by 33.28% and 75.56%, respectively. The combination of biochar, AMF, and plant roots showed the largest increase in maize plant biomass. The AMF and AMF with root treatments all significantly decreased the nirS + nirK/nosZ ratio and N2O emissions at two biochar levels. The presence of AMF and plant roots during biochar amendment showed the smallest nirS + nirK/nosZ ratio and N2O emissions. The AMF combined with biochar and AMF and plant roots combined with biochar treatments increased nirS + nirK/nosZ by 24.32% and 26.90% and decreased N2O accumulation emission by 21.12% and 38.13%, respectively. The results imply that biochar, AMF, and plant roots reduced N2O emissions directly by reducing soil N and increasing soil N unitization efficiency and indirectly by shifting the N2O production and consumption gene abundance in agroecosystems. These findings suggest that the addition of biochar and AMF and/or the presence of plant roots can interact to alleviate soil N2O emissions by manipulating plant inorganic N acquisition and the soil denitrification process.

Effect of cover crops on greenhouse gas emissions in an irrigated field under integrated soil fertility management. Agronomical and environmental benefits are associated with replacing winter fallow by cover crops (CCs). Yet, the effect of this practice on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remains poorly understood. In this context, a field experiment was carried out under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effect of replacing the traditional winter fallow (F) by vetch (Vicia sativa L.; V) or barley (Hordeum vulgare L.; B) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the intercrop and the maize (Zea mays L.) cropping period. The maize was fertilized following integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) criteria. Maize nitrogen (N) uptake, soil mineral N concentrations, soil temperature and moisture, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and GHG fluxes were measured during the experiment. Our management (adjusted N synthetic rates due to ISFM) and pedo-climatic conditions resulted in low cumulative N2O emissions (0.57 to 0.75 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) , yield-scaled N2O emissions (36 gN(2)O-N kg aboveground N uptake(-1)) and N surplus (31 to 56 kg N ha(-1)) for all treatments. Although CCs increased N2O emissions during the intercrop period compared to F (1.6 and 2.6 times in B and V, respectively), the ISFM resulted in similar cumulative emissions for the CCs and F at the end of the maize cropping period. The higher C : N ratio of the B residue led to a greater proportion of N2O losses from the synthetic fertilizer in these plots when compared to V. No significant differences were observed in CH4 and CO2 fluxes at the end of the experiment. This study shows that the use of both legume and nonlegume CCs combined with ISFM could provide, in addition to the advantages reported in previous studies, an opportunity to maximize agronomic efficiency (lowering synthetic N requirements for the subsequent cash crop) without increasing cumulative or yield-scaled N2O losses.

How Tillage and Fertilization Influence Soil N2O Emissions after Forestland Conversion to Cropland. Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are influenced by land use adjustment and management practices. To meet the increasing socioeconomic development and sustainable demands for food supply, forestland conversion to cropland occurs around the world. However, the effects of forestland conversion to cropland as well as of tillage and fertilization practices on soil N2O emissions are still not well understood, especially in subtropical regions. Therefore, field experiments were carried out to continuously monitor soil N2O emissions after the conversion of forestland to cropland in a subtropical region in Southwest China. One forestland site and four cropland sites were selected: forestland (CK), short-term croplands (tillage with and without fertilization, NC-TF and NC-T), and long-term croplands (tillage with and without fertilization, LC-TF and LC-T). The annual cumulative N2O flux was 0.21 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in forestland. After forestland conversion to cropland, the annual cumulative N2O flux significantly increased by 76-491%. In the short-term and long-term croplands, tillage with fertilization induced cumulative soil N2O emissions that were 94% and 235% higher than those from tillage without fertilization. Fertilization contributed 63% and 84% to increased N2O emissions in the short-term and long-term croplands, respectively. A stepwise regression analysis showed that soil N2O emissions from croplands were mainly influenced by soil NO3- and NH4+ availability and WFPS (water-filled pore space). Fertilization led to higher soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, which thus resulted in larger N2O fluxes. Thus, to reduce soil N2O emissions and promote the sustainable development of the eco-environment, we recommend limiting the conversion of forestland to cropland, and meanwhile intensifying the shift from grain to green or applying advanced agricultural management practices as much as possible.

Partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer improves soil fertility and crop yields while mitigating N2O emissions in wheat-maize rotation system. Excessive synthetic N fertilization has resulted in severe soil degradation and high greenhouse gas emissions in agroecosystems. As a promising approach for achieving sustainable agriculture, partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer can affect the stoichiometric balance between organic C and inorganic N, thereby regulating nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. However, the responses of soil N2O emissions and crop productivity to different ratios of organic fertilizer (OF) to synthetic fertilizer (SF) are still unclear, making the optimal fertilization scheme less accurate. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to measure soil properties, N2O emissions, and crop yields in a wheat-maize rotation system. Six fertilization managements were included: no fertilization (CK); total SF; and 15%, 30%, 45%, and 100% of organic substitution for synthetic fertilizers (LO, MO, HO, and OF), respectively. Compared to SF, soil annual cumulative N2O emissions in LO, MO, HO, and OF were significantly reduced by 16.2-20.5%, 28.9-33.9%, 33.2-42.2%, and 70.2-74.9% in two years, respectively. The mitigation of N2O emission with organic substitution was mainly attributed to the decreasing NO3 - and NH4+ contents and increasing soil pH. Meanwhile, soil organic C and total N were considerably higher in HO and OF than other treatments, with the lowest in CK in wheat season and in SF in maize season. Synthetic fertilizer and partial organic substitution increased the annual yield of wheat and maize compared with OF and CK in the first year, and HO increased the annual yield by 9.7% and 37.6% compared with SF and OF in the second year, respectively. The beneficial yield effects were mainly due to the enhanced synchronization of nutrient availability and soil fertility with partial organic substitution. Finally, the yield-scaled N2O emissions were reduced with increasing ratios of organic substitution in two years. Our study suggested that partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer, especially 45% organic substitution would be feasible fertilization strategy to improve soil fertility and crop productivity while mitigating N2O emissions in wheat-maize rotation systems.

Calibration and validation of the DNDC model to estimate nitrous oxide emissions and crop productivity for a summer maize-winter wheat double cropping system in Hebei, China. The main aim of this paper was to calibrate and evaluate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model for estimating N2O emissions and crop productivity for a summer maize-winter wheat double cropping system with different N fertilizer rates in Hebei, China. The model's performance was assessed before and after calibration and model sensitivity was investigated. The calibrated and validated DNDC performed effectively in estimating cumulative N2O emissions (coefficient of determination (1:1 relationship; r(2)) = 0.91; relative deviation (RD) = -13 to 16%) and grain yields for both crops (r(2) = 0.91; RD = -21 to 7%) from all fertilized treatments, but poorly estimated daily N2O patterns. Observed and simulated results showed that optimal N fertilizer treatment decreased cumulative N2O flux, compared to conventional N fertilizer, without a significant impact on grain yields of the summer maize-winter wheat double cropping system. The high sensitivity of the DNDC model to rainfall, soil organic carbon and temperature resulted in significant overestimation of N2O peaks during the warm wet season. The model also satisfactorily estimated daily patterns/average soil temperature (degrees C; 0-5 cm depth) (r(2) = 0.88 to 0.89; root mean square error (RMSE) = 4 degrees C; normalized RMSE (nRMSE) = 25% and index of agreement (d) = 0.89-0.97) but under-predicted water filled pore space (WFPS; %; 0-20 cm depth) (r(2) = 0.3 to 0.4) and soil ammonium and nitrate (exchangeable NH4+& NO3-; kg N ha(-1); r(2) == 0.97). With reference to the control treatment (no N fertilizer), DNDC was weak in simulating both N2O emissions and crop productivity. To be further improved for use under pedo-climatic conditions of the summer maize-winter wheat double cropping system we suggest future studies to identify and resolve the existing problems with the DNDC, especially with the control treatment.

Nitrogen fertilizer management for nitrous oxide (N2O) mitigation in intensive corn (Maize) production: an emissions reduction protocol for US Midwest agriculture. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a major greenhouse gas (GHG) product of intensive agriculture. Fertilizer nitrogen (N) rate is the best single predictor of N2O emissions in row-crop agriculture in the US Midwest. We use this relationship to propose a transparent, scientifically robust protocol that can be utilized by developers of agricultural offset projects for generating fungible GHG emission reduction credits for the emerging US carbon cap and trade market. By coupling predicted N2O flux with the recently developed maximum return to N (MRTN) approach for determining economically profitable N input rates for optimized crop yield, we provide the basis for incentivizing N2O reductions without affecting yields. The protocol, if widely adopted, could reduce N2O from fertilized row-crop agriculture by more than 50%. Although other management and environmental factors can influence N2O emissions, fertilizer N rate can be viewed as a single unambiguous proxy-a transparent, tangible, and readily manageable commodity. Our protocol addresses baseline establishment, additionality, permanence, variability, and leakage, and provides for producers and other stakeholders the economic and environmental incentives necessary for adoption of agricultural N2O reduction offset projects.

Seasonal nitrous oxide emissions from different land uses and their controlling factors in a tropical riparian ecosystem. An important ecological service provided by tropical riparian ecosystems is the mitigation of nutrient pollution (e.g. nitrate) from surrounding agricultural areas. However, a negative impact of this nutrient remediation may be that the ecozone also functions as a major emitter of nitrous oxide (N2O). We hypothesized that the high inorganic nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil water content in tropical riparian ecosystems enhances N2O production through rapid nitrification and denitrification processes. This study was therefore designed to quantify the variability in N2O emissions in such an ecosystem in northern Thailand with specific emphasis on (1) different land uses (comparing replicate leguminous reforestation areas with conventional maize agriculture with high rates of nitrogen fertilizer addition), and (2) temporal aspects (comparing wet and dry seasons). Our aim was to quantify N2O emissions and to identify the major drivers controlling these emissions. Using in situ closed chambers the annual average emissions of N2O from the leguminous reforestation area (3.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1)) was significantly higher than agricultural areas with maize (2.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1))). The seasonal variation results indicated that the rate of N2O flux in the wet season was higher than in the dry season. The variations of N2O emission rates were strongly correlated with water filled pore space (WFPS), denitrification, and microbial biomass C, but not with nitrification. This study indicates that when inorganic N and soil organic C are sufficient, WFPS plays an important role in controlling N2O emissions from denitrification. Comparatively, annual N2O emissions from the tropical riparian reforestation were similar to that reported for temperate riparian forests and other ecosystems. Although the annual N2O emissions from the maize agricultural area were comparable to other crops cultivated in riparian ecosystems, it was higher than the N2O fluxes from crops grown in non-riparian zones. We conclude that agricultural lands located in tropical riparian zones do not represent a major hotspot of N2O emissions and that this does not diminish the positive benefits they provide in relation to other aspects of ecosystem service provision.

Negative pressure irrigation as a potential technique for increasing vegetable yields and decreasing nitrous oxide emissions. Irrigation is a common practice used to promote vegetable yields through high agricultural inputs, which potentially increases nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, it is still unclear how an effective irrigation strategy could increase yield by regulating soil water conditions, ultimately mitigating N2O emissions. In this study, negative pressure irrigation (NPI) and furrow irrigation (FI) were applied to control two different soil conditions (i.e., the stable soil water content and the dry-wet cycles) in a vegetable greenhouse growing amaranth (Amaranthus hybridus L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The key objective was to assess the effect of irrigation on vegetable yields and N2O emissions and further reveal their controlling factors. Compared to FI, NPI increased the seasonal stability of soil moisture, NH4+-N, and NO3-N by 11.4%, 26.4%, and 21.2%, respectively. NPI also increased vegetable yields by 16.6%20.3%, whereas the average area-scaled and yield-scaled N2O emissions under NPI were 15.1% and 29.2% lower than FI, respectively. Notably, the N2O emissions could be affected by soil moisture, temperature, NH4+-N, NO3-N, and soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, but the relative importance of these factors was different under the two irrigation systems due to different soil water conditions. The random forest (RF) model showed that soil moisture was the most crucial factor driving N2O flux under FI, whereas soil NO3-N and NH4+-N were the key governing factors under NPI. Overall, this study highlights the importance of increasing seasonal soil water stability for improving the sustainability of irrigation and NPI was a promising irrigation strategy to promote vegetable yields while mitigating N2O emissions.

Impacts of Fertilization Alternatives and Crop Straw Incorporation on N2O Emissions from a Spring Maize Field in Northeastern China. Spring maize is one of the most popular crops planted in northeastern China. The cropping systems involving spring maize have been maintaining high production through intensive management practices. However, the high rates of nitrogen (N) fertilizers application could have introduced a great amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. It is crucial for sustaining the maize production systems to reduce N2O emissions meanwhile maintaining the optimum yields by adopting alternative farming management practices. The goal of this study was to evaluate effects of alternative fertilization and crop residue management practices on N2O emission as well as crop yield for a typical maize field in northeastern China. Field experiments were conducted during the 2010-2011 maize growing seasons (from early May to late September) in Liaoning Province, northeastern China. N2O fluxes were measured at the field plots with six different treatments including no N fertilizer use (CK), farmers' conventional N fertilizer application rate (FP), reduced N fertilizer rate (OPT), reduced N fertilizer rate combined with crop straw amendment (OPTS), slow-release N fertilizer (CRF), and reduced N fertilizer rate combined with nitrification inhibitor (OPT+DCD). The static chamber method combined with gas chromatography technique was employed to conduct the measurements of N2O fluxes. The field data showed that N2O emissions varied across the treatments. During the maize growing season in 2010, the total N2O emissions under the treatments of CK, FP, OPT, OPTS, and CRF were 0.63, 1.11, 1.03, 1.26, and 0.98 kg N ha(-1), respectively. The seasonal cumulative N2O emissions were 0.54, 1.07, 0.96, 1.12, and 0.84 kg N ha(-1), respectively, under CK, FP, OPT, OPTS, and OPT+DCD in 2011. In comparison with FP, CRF or OPT+DCD reduced the N2O emissions by 12 or 21%, respectively, while the crop yields remained unchanged. The results indicate that the reduction of N-fertilizer application rate in combination with the slow-release fertilizer type or nitrification inhibitor could effectively mitigate N2O emissions from the tested field. The incorporation of crop residue didn't show positive effect on mitigating N2O emissions from the tested cropping system. The field study can provide useful information for the on-going debate on alternative N fertilization strategies and crop straw management in China. However, further studies would be needed to explore the long-term impacts of the alternative management practices on a wide range of environmental services.

Short-term emissions of CO2 and N2O in response to periodic flood irrigation with waste water in the Mezquital Valley of Mexico. Irrigation with waste water adds labile carbon and nitrogen compounds to the soil, and when applied by flooding it rapidly changes the soil's atmosphere and redox potential. In the Mezquital Valley more than 90 000 ha is irrigated with waste water from Mexico City, and enhanced emissions of CO2 and N2O follow each flooding. We measured the emissions of these two gases from a field irrigated periodically with waste water and under three crops, namely alfalfa, rye-grass and maize, using static chambers for 21 months. We also measured emissions from a field growing rain-fed maize before and shortly after two rain events. The data from repeated measurements from the same chambers are correlated in time, and so we modelled the ante-dependence and fitted the models by residual maximum likelihood (REML). The emissions of both CO2 and N2O increased rapidly in response to flood irrigation with peaks up to 448 mg C m(-2) hour(-1) for CO2 and 2.98 mg N m(-2) hour(-1) for N2O under maize. Emissions peaked in particular irrigation events either as the infiltrating water replaced the gas from air-filled pores or several days after irrigation as excess nitrogen and fresh sources of carbon were mineralized. Processes operating during the few days during and immediately after irrigation seem to determine the dynamics of gaseous production in this agricultural ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrous oxide emissions from a New Zealand cropped soil: tillage effects, spatial and seasonal variability. Agricultural practices are believed to be the major anthropogenic source of enhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) gas emissions in New Zealand. Studies conducted in New Zealand generally suggest low N2O emission from pasture; however, there is little information for arable farming systems. This paper evaluates tillage and land use effects on N2O emissions using a closed chamber technique at an Ohakea silt loam (Gleyic luvisol) where winter oats (Avena sativa L.)/fodder maize (Zea mays L.) was double-cropped for 5 years. The tillage types included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, and a permanent pasture (PP) was used as a control. Spatial variability in all treatments showed large inherent variations in N2O fluxes (a mean CV = 119%), which reflected natural soil heterogeneity, and perhaps the measurement technique used rather than the real differences due to the tillage and cropping systems evaluated. On an annualised basis, N2O emissions measured from December 1998 to September 1999 from the PP (1.66 kg N2O-N/ha per year or 19 mug N2O-N/(m(2) h)) were significantly lower than the CT and NT fields averaging at 9.20 (or 105) and 12.0 (or 137) kg N2O-N/ha per year (or mug N2O-N/(m(2) h)), respectively. However, there were no differences in N2O emission rates between the CT and NT treatments. Seedbed preparation using a power harrow which followed within a few days of first ploughing the CT field reduced N2O emissions by 65% within the first hour after power harrowing. However, N2O emission rates returned to the pre-power harrowing levels at the next sampling period, which was 1 month later. There was a strong relationship between log-transformed data of soil water content (SWC) and N2O emissions in all treatments with r = 0.73, 0.75 and 0.86 for the PP, CT and NT treatments, respectively. Seasonal variations in N2O emission from the PP were in the order of winter = autumn > summer. Although fluxes in the CT were higher in winter than in the autumn season, there were no differences between the summer and autumn data. The seasonal variations in N2O emission in the NT treatment were in the order of winter > autumn = summer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Crop residue effect on crop performance, soil N2O and CO2 emissions in alley cropping systems in subtropical China. Land management practices that simultaneously improve soil properties are crucial to high crop production and minimize detrimental impact on the environment. We examined the effects of crop residues on crop performance, the fluxes of soil N2O and CO2 under wheat-maize (WM) and/or faba bean-maize (FM) rotations in Amorpha fruticosa (A) and Vetiveria zizanioides (V) intercropping systems on a loamy clay soil, in subtropical China. Crop performance, soil N2O and CO2 as well as some potential factors such as soil water content, soil carbon, soil nitrogen, microbial biomass and N mineralization were recorded during 2006 maize crop cultivation. Soil N2O and CO2 fluxes are determined using a closed-based chamber. Maize yield was greater after faba bean than after wheat may be due to differences in supply of N from residues. The presence of hedgerow significantly improved maize grain yields. N2O emissions from soils with maize were considerably greater after faba bean (345 g N2O-N ha(-1)) than after wheat (289 g N2O-N ha(-1)). However, the cumulated N2O emissions did not differ significantly between WM and FM. The difference in N2O emissions between WM and FM was mostly due to the amounts of crop residues. Hedgerow alley cropping tended to emit more N2O than WM and FM, in particular A. fruticosa intercropping systems. Over the entire 118 days of measurement, the N2O fluxes represented 534 g N2O-N ha(-1) (AWM) and 512 g N2O-N ha(-1) (AFM) under A. fruticosa species, 403 g N2O-N ha(-1) (VWM) and 423 g N2O-N ha(-1) (VFM) under Vetiver grass. We observed significantly higher CO2 emission in AFM (5,335 kg CO2-C ha(-1)) from June to October, whereas no significant difference was observed among WM (3,480 kg CO2-C ha(-1)), FM (3,302 kg CO2-C ha(-1)), AWM (3,877 kg CO2-C ha(-1)), VWM (3,124 kg CO2-C ha(-1)) and VFM (3,309 kg CO2-C ha(-1)), indicating the importance of A. fruticosa along with faba bean residue on CO2 fluxes. As a result, crop residues and land conversion from agricultural to agroforestry can, in turn, influence microbial biomass, N mineralization, soil C and N content, which can further alter the magnitude of crop growth, soil N2O and CO2 emissions in the present environmental conditions.

Mineralization Patterns of Maize Straw in Fluvio-Aquatic Soil as Determined by Isotopic Traces. The mineralization of plant residues results in changes in soil C and N. However, it is difficult to determine the origins of C and N from either soil organic matter mineralization or residue decomposition using traditional methods. An incubation experiment containing two treatments (blank soil (BS) and soil with 6% maize straw (MS)) was conducted to assess the contributions of maize straw to gas emissions, and to soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) using isotopic tracers. About 11.5% of maize straw C was sequestered in soil, the cumulative amount of C emitted from MS was 2.5-fold higher than that in BS treatment. A positive priming effect of maize straw on native SOC in the first 14 days was observed, and then became negative, indicating the potential for a positive balance of SOC storage. Cumulative N2O emissions in MS markedly decreased by 22.4% compared with BS, and the loss of N via N2O in MS was approximately 3.3%. Maize straw significantly increased soil TN and contributed 15.8% to TN at day 120. Our study clearly demonstrated that the different dynamics of C-13 and N-15 in the soils and gases indicated differences of maize straw C and N during decomposition. Maize straw C preferred to contribute to CO2 emissions, while maize straw N contributed more to soil TN.

Soil pH differently affects N2O emissions from soils amended with chemical fertilizer and manure by modifying nitrification and denitrification in wheat-maize rotation system. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, from farmland have been recognized to be affected by soil pH and nitrogen (N) fertilizer application. However, the interactive effects of soil pH and N fertilizer type on N2O emissions and their influencing mechanism are poorly understood. A field experiment was conducted to elucidate the impacts of synthetic fertilizer and manure on soil properties and N2O fluxes along a soil acidity gradient (soil pH = 6.8, 6.1, 5.2, and 4.2) in the Huai River Basin, and a lab incubation experiment was performed to understand the underlying mechanisms of changed N2O flux. Low soil pH inhibited the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria abundance and thereby reduced the N2O production by nitrification under both synthetic fertilizer and manure application. The N2O production by denitrification was also reduced with declining soil pH, likely due to the decreased nirS and nirK abundances, and lower NO3-. However, low soil pH reduced the nosZ abundance and increased (nirS + nirK)/nosZ ratio, resulting in the increased N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratio. Finally, with the decreased nitrification and denitrification, soil N2O emission was significantly reduced with declining soil pH regardless of fertilizer types. Compared with synthetic fertilizer, manure application increased soil nutrients (total N, dissolved organic C, and NO3-), nirK abundance, and (nirS + nirK)/nosZ ratio in the soils with pH of 5.2 and 4.2, thereby promoting N2O production by denitrification and N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio in acidic soils. Consequently, soil N2O emission was increased with manure application in acidic soils. This study provides novel insight and improves our understanding of how soil pH regulates nitrification, denitrification, and N2O emissions from soils amended with chemical fertilizer and manure, which gives guidance on developing N management strategies for sustainable production and N2O mitigation in acid soils.

Direct N2O emission factors for synthetic N-fertilizer and organic residues applied on sugarcane for bioethanol production in Central-Southern Brazil. The production and use of biofuels have increased rapidly in recent decades. Bioethanol derived from sugarcane has become a promising alternative to fossil fuel for use in automotive vehicles. The savings' calculated from the carbon footprint of this energy source still generates many questions related to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from sugarcane cultivation. We quantified N2O emissions from soil covered with different amounts of sugarcane straw and determined the direct N2O emission factors of nitrogen fertilizers (applied at the planting furrows and in the topdressing) and the by-products of sugarcane processing (filter cake and vinasse) applied to sugarcane fields. The results showed that the presence of different amounts of sugarcane straw did not change N2O emissions relative to bare soil (control). N-fertilizer increased N2O emissions from the soil, especially when urea was used, both at the planting furrow (plant cane) and during the regrowth process (ratoon cane) in relation to ammonium nitrate. The emission factor for N-fertilizer was 0.46 +/- 0.33%. The field application of filter cake and vinasse favored N2O emissions from the soil, the emission factor for vinasse was 0.65 +/- 0.29%, while filter cake had a lower emission factor of 0.13 +/- 0.04%. The experimentally obtained N2O emission factors associated with sugarcane cultivation, specific to the major sugarcane production region of the Brazil, were lower than those considered by the IPCC. Thus, the results of this study should contribute to bioethanol carbon footprint calculations.

Long-term tillage, residue management and crop rotation impacts on N2O and CH4 emissions from two contrasting soils in sub-humid Zimbabwe. The respective contribution of conservation agriculture (CA) principles (no-tillage, permanent soil cover/mulch and crop rotations) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is still unclear. This study was conducted at two long-term experimental sites established in 2013 in Zimbabwe, on an abruptic Lixisol at Domboshava Training Center (DTC) and on a xanthic Ferralsol at the University of Zimbabwe Farm (UZF). The purpose of the study was to unravel the individual and combined effects of tillage, mulching and rotation on N2O and CH4 emissions in low nitrogen (N) input maize-based cropping systems (< 60 kg N ha -1) and to compare emissions within maize rows and between maize rows. We hypothesised that integrating no tillage, mulch and cereal-legume rotation would enhance N2O emissions. Six treatments, replicated four times were investigated: conventional tillage, conven-tional tillage with rotation, no-tillage, no-tillage with mulch, no-tillage with rotation, no-tillage with mulch and rotation. The main crop was maize (Zea mays L.) and treatments with rotation included cowpea (Vigna unguiculate L. Walp.). Gas samples were regularly collected using the static chamber method in the maize row and inter-row spaces during the 2019/20 and 2020/21 cropping seasons and during the 2020/21 dry season. Soil moisture and mineral N were measured in the 0-20 cm soil depth. In 2019/20, cumulative total N2O emissions were signif-icantly higher in mulch treatments at DTC, while at UZF N2O emissions were higher with cowpea rotation. Cumulative total N2O emissions ranged from 215 to 496 g N2O-N ha- 1 yr- 1 and from 226 to 395 g N2O-N ha- 1 yr -1, at DTC and UZF, respectively. In 2020/21, N2O emissions were much lower and no differences were found between treatments on both sites (145 to 179 g N2O-N ha- 1 yr- 1 and 83 to 136 g N2O-N ha- 1 yr- 1 at DTC and UZF, respectively). A significant relationship was found between soil nitrate and daily N2O emissions. At UZF, highest N2O emissions were observed at a water-filled pore space of 60-70%. There were no significant differ-ences in yield-scaled N2O emissions between treatments at both sites for the two seasons. DTC was a net source of CH4 (694 g CH4-C ha- 1 yr- 1 on average), while UZF was a net sink of CH4 (-494 g CH4-C ha- 1 yr- 1 on average). No evidence was found for in situ CH4 production at DTC, and an external source is most likely. Our study in-dicates that for low N input cropping systems in the sub-humid tropics, N loss through N2O is low.

Increased N2O emissions during soil drying after waterlogging and spring thaw in a record wet year. Global climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events, which can dramatically alter soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, our ability to predict this effect is limited due to the lack of studies under real-world conditions. We conducted a field experiment in a maize-cultivated black soil in northeast China with six treatments: control without nitrogen (N) application (CK) and N-fertilized treatments with the ratio of urea N to manure N at 100:0 (NPK), 75:25 (OM1), 50:50 (OM2), 25:75 (OM3) and 0:100 (OM4). The experimental year was the wettest on record with an extreme rainfall event of 178 mm occurring in summer 2013. Annual N2O emissions from CK and NPK were increased by 168% and 171%, respectively, relative to normal wet years. Extreme rainfall saturated soils, resulted in low N2O fluxes (<20 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) lasting for 25 d. However, N2O flux peaked (169-264 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) in all treatments as the soil dried. Total N2O emissions were 0.43 -0.74 kg N ha(-1) over the drying period, accounting for 47.5-51.2% of the annual budget. High N2O fluxes occurred when the ratio of soil nitrate (NO3-) to dissolved organic carbon was 0.07-0.10 mg N mg(-1) C, NOT concentration was >3 mg N kg(-1) and water-filled pore space was 67-76%. Distinctly higher N2O fluxes were also identified during the spring thaw period, accumulating to 20.1-49.4% of the non growing season emissions. Emissions upon thawing were likely related to denitrification induced by high moisture conditions as a result of lag effect of the extreme rainfall. Annual N2O emissions progressively reduced as the ratio, of urea N:manure N shifted towards manure, which was also the case during soil drying after waterlogging. Total N2O emissions were reduced by 25.6% for OM4 than NPK. Overall, our results suggest that soil N2O emissions were increased in the record wet year but a shift from urea towards manure with more N applied as starter N can minimize the N2O losses.

Effects of Conservation Tillage and Nitrogen Inhibitors on Yield and N2O Emissions for Spring Maize in Northeast China. Conservation tillage can improve soil health and carbon sequestration and is helpful for sustainable agricultural development. However, its effect on crop yields and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is still controversial. In this study, a two-year field experiment of spring maize was conducted from 2019 to 2020 in the Phaeozems region of Northeast China, involving two tillage practices (strip tillage and conventional tillage) and two nitrogen inhibitors (N-butylthiophosphorotriamine, NBPT and 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate, DMPP). The WHCNS (Soil Water Heat Carbon Nitrogen Simulator) model was calibrated and validated with field observations, and the effects of different tillage practices and nitrification inhibitors on spring maize yield, N2O emissions, water use efficiency (WUE), and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were simulated using the WHCNS model. Precipitation scenarios were set up to simulate and analyze the changes in patterns of crop yield and N2O emissions under long-term conservation tillage for 30 years (1991-2020). The results showed that concerning maize yield, under conservation tillage, the type of straw and nitrogen fertilizer inhibitor could explain 72.1% and 7.1%, respectively, of the total variance in maize yield, while precipitation explained only 14.1% of the total variance, with a 28.5% increase in crop yield in a humid year compared to a dry year. N2O emissions were principally influenced by precipitation, which could explain 46.4% of the total variance in N2O emissions. Furthermore, N2O emissions were 385% higher in humid years than in dry years. Straw under conservation tillage and inhibitor type explained 8.1% and 19.4% of the total variance in N2O emissions, respectively. Conservation tillage with nitrification inhibitors is recommended to increase crop yields, improve soil quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Phaeozems region of Northeast China, thus ensuring sustainable agricultural development in the region.

Stover Harvest did not Change Nitrous Oxide Emissions in Two Minnesota Fields. Corn (Zea mays L.) is grown across vast acreages producing massive quantities of stover making corn a desirable cellulosic bioenergy feedstock. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) so small changes in direct soil N2O emissions may have substantial influence on global warming potential (GWP) from the agricultural sector. Harvesting stover alters soil properties such as soil moisture, oxygen availability, temperature, and substrate availability (C and N). Thus, harvesting stover might reduce soil N2O emissions by reducing substrate and by warming and drying the soil. The goal of the study was to determine how harvesting corn stover altered soil N2O emissions. Therefore, soil N2O emissions were measured for four crop-years (planting to planting) in two independent studies, one in a field managed without tillage (NT1995) and the other was in a field tilled annually with a chisel plow (Chisel). Each field was in a cornsoybean (Glycine max L. [Merr.]) rotation, with (i) corn grain (Grain) only, (ii) grain plus about 50% of the stover harvested (Grain+ Moderate), and (iii) grain plus harvesting as much stover as possible (Grain+ Aggressive) treatments. Cumulative soil N2O emissions did not differ among treatments in either field during any of the crop-years monitored. Flux events occurred corresponding to fertilizer applications and to spring freeze-thaw events. Cumulative fertilizer stimulated emissions tended to be greater for corn than soybean because of N-fertilizer application. These results are valuable to modelers for enhancing estimates of the N2O component of the stover management C-footprint. C1 [Johnson, Jane M.

Nitrous oxide fluxes from a fertilised maize crop using micrometeorological and chamber methods. Emissions of N2O from maize fields irrigated and fertilised with 200 kg N ha(-1) were measured using several chamber and micrometeorological techniques at a single site in the Landes de Gascogne (France). The methods were compared over similar periods, but the sampling areas covered range from 0.18 m(2) for the chamber methods to 10(4)-10(5) m(2) for the micrometeorological methods. Nitrous oxide concentration was measured using electron capture gas chromatography (GC) for the chamber technique. Micrometeorological fluxes were determined by eddy covariance and gradient methods with N2O mixing ratios measured using fast-response tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. The spatial heterogeneity of N2O emissions was studied with a set of 30 closed chambers. This study showed an anisotropic distribution of N2O emissions which was attributed to the pattern of fertiliser application. A sensitivity analysis of the micrometeorological techniques indicated that uncertainties on Aux assessment are mainly due to spatial heterogeneity of N2O emissions. Fluxes measured using chamber and micrometeorological techniques were compared over a 2 h period. Depending on the precision of the techniques, good agreement between the magnitude of the fluxes measured by chamber and micrometeorological methods was observed. For micrometeorological methods, the Aux ranged from 20 to 400 ng N-N2O m(-2) s(-1) and from 25 to 275 ng N-N2O m(-2) s(-1) for chamber method. Average relative variations of the Aux were similar in both methods, and were mainly dependent on the soil water content. Using micrometeorological measurements, large variations of the flux were observed from 1 h to the next related to variations in the wind direction combined with spatial heterogeneity.

Dynamics of nitrous oxide emissions from two cropping systems in southwestern France over 5 years: Cross impact analysis of heterogeneous agricultural practices and local climate variability. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were measured and compared on 2 typical crop rotations of a grain farm and a dairy farm with feed cropping, over 5 years (from 2012 to 2016) in southwestern France. The annual N2O emissions of the 5 typical rotational crops of the region (summer crops: irrigated maize and sunflower; winter crops: winter wheat, rapeseed and barley) varied from 0.95 +/- 0.88 to 7.96 +/- 1.73 kgN ha-1, with the highest values observed on the dairy farm plot and for summer crops. N2O emissions were analysed on a daily, monthly, seasonal and annual basis, and correlated with their main direct or indirect drivers, i. e. water and nitrogen (mineral or organic) supply amount, rotational crops, vegetation covering and tillage. We observed a marked seasonal pattern of N2O emission peaks. On average, more than 50% of N2O emissions occurred during spring for summer crops, and more than 40% occurred in winter for winter crops. We have identified agricultural practices that increase N2O emissions. In particular, our results show that when the soil is left bare or with limited crop development, spring mineralization of organic N residues (from previous crop or winter cover crop) results in N losses, partly as emissions of N2O, which are detrimental to agronomic performance (low NUE).We also conducted an agronomic assessment of annual N2O emissions versus nitrogen surplus and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), which lead us to discuss agricultural practices that may mitigate N2O emissions while optimizing agronomic and economic performance of crops. Indeed, we point out that N surplus and N fate may be controlled through the right timing of sowing, cover crop, irrigation and fertilization.

Impact of different soil erosion levels on gross N transformation processes and gaseous N losses: An incubation study. Erosion is a key driver of topsoil removal in agriculture, resulting in nutrient losses and leaving truncated soil profiles on shoulder slopes, where subsoil material can be incorporated into topsoil by the plough, changing soil properties and, thus, altering biogeochemical cycling and associated nitrogen (N) losses. To date, the effects of topsoil erosion on N cycling have rarely been investigated. We conducted a short-term mesocosm experiment, integrating N-15 tracing techniques to quantify N transformation processes, focusing on N availability and N losses in three artificially eroded agricultural topsoils. Nitrogen transformation pathways were simulated using the numerical model Ntrace, considering N uptake by maize (Zea mays L.) at early development stages. The N-15 label also allows the quantification of nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N-2) losses by applying the N-15 gas flux method ((15)NGF). Erosion induced topsoil dilution significantly reduced gross N turnover and consequently N2O and N-2 emissions in both treatments with and without plants. The oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3-) was by far the dominating N pathway across all investigated topsoils, followed by N-org mineralization > NH4+ immobilization. However, more than 90 % of total N2O losses derived from the NO3- pool, with coupled nitrification-denitrification assumed to be the dominant process at water contents of similar to 40 % water-filled pore space (WFPS). Although maize more than doubled N2O + N-2 emissions in some treatments, the overall effect of topsoil dilution on gaseous N losses was considerably greater, independent of maize presence. Our study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of N cycling in erosion-affected agricultural soils, which is essential for enhancing N fertilizer use efficiencies and reducing N pollution.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining yield in the croplands of Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, China. Agroecosystems face double pressures of producing more food to feed growing global population and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate climate change. The Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) plain produces similar to 1/3 wheat and maize of China with very high resource inputs, particularly synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers since the 1980 s. Although fertilizer input has substantially increased crop yield and enhanced biomass carbon (C) input to the soil and thus stimulating soil C sequestration, GHG emissions (e.g., nitrous oxide (N2O)) relating to the fertilizers have been also dramatically increased. Yet, a systematic regional assessment on the trade-offs between crop yield, soil C sequestration and N2O emissions as impacted by management practices and environmental conditions is lacking. Here we calibrated a fanning system model to conduct comprehensive assessment on crop yield and GHG emissions (soil CO2 and N2O emissions) during the period 1981-2010 across the HHH plain at the resolution of 10 km. We found that soil in HHH plain was a C sink with an annual C sequestration rate of 1.53 CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (0-30 cm soil layer) during the period under current typical agricultural practices, but this sink could only offset about 68% of global warming potential from contemporary N2O emissions. By reducing the annual N input rate (from current more than 300 to similar to 250 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and enhancing crop residue retention rate (from current 30% to 100%), the HHH plain could act as a net sink of GHG without sacrificing grain yield. Apart from management, the effects of three key environmental factors, i.e., mean annual rainfall and temperature and initial soil organic carbon stock on dynamics of crop yield, soil CO2 and N2O emissions were also studied. The results will have important implications for the development of management strategies to maintain yield while reducing GHG emissions.

Soil respiration and N2O emission in croplands under different ploughing practices: a case study in south-east China. Studies on the CO2 and N2O emission patterns of agricultural soils under different ploughing practices may provide an insight into the potential and magnitude of CO2 and N2O mitigation in highly managed farmland soils. In this study, field measurements of soil respiration and N2O flux with different ploughing depths were performed in the 2003-04 wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), 2004 maize (Zea mays L.), and 2004-05 wheat seasons. Soil temperature and moisture were simultaneously measured. Results showed that, in each cropping season, the seasonal variation in soil respiration developed with a similar pattern for different treatments, which was primarily regulated by soil temperature. This work demonstrates that ploughing depth can influence long-term loss of carbon from soil, but this was contingent on preceding cropping types. Given the same preceding cropping practice, no significant difference in N2O emission was found among different ploughing depths in each cropping season.

Estimation of net gain of soil carbon in a nitrogen-fixing tree and crop intercropping system in sub-Saharan Africa: results from re-examining a study. Nitrogen (N)-fixing tree and crop intercropping systems can be a sustainable agricultural practice in sub-Saharan Africa and can also contribute to resolving climate change through enhancing soil carbon (C) sequestration. A study conducted by Makumba et al. (Agric Ecosyst Environ 118:237-243, 2007) on the N-fixing tree gliricidia and maize intercropping system in southern Malawi provides a rare dataset of both sequestered soil C and C loss as soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, no soil C gain and loss estimates were made so the study failed to show the net gain of soil C. Also absent from this study was potential benefit or negative impact related to the other greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from the intercropping system. Using the data provided in Makumba et al. (Agric Ecosyst Environ 118:237-243, 2007) a C loss as soil CO2 emissions (51.2 +/- A 0.4 Mg C ha(-1)) was estimated, amounting to 67.4% of the sequestered soil C (76 +/- A 8.6 Mg C ha(-1) in 0-2 m soil depth) for the first 7 years in the intercropping system. An annual net gain of soil C of 3.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) was estimated from soil C sequestered and lost. Inclusion of the potential for N2O mitigation [0.12-1.97 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1), 0.036-0.59 Mg CO2 equivalents (eq.) ha(-1) year(-1)] within this intercropping system mitigation as CO2 eq. basis was estimated to be 3.5-4.1 Mg CO2 eq. ha(-1) year(-1). These results suggest that reducing N2O emission can significantly increase the overall mitigation benefit from the intercropping system. However, significant uncertainties are associated with estimating the effect of intercropping on soil N2O and CH4 emissions. These results stress the importance of including consideration of quantifying soil CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions when quantifying the C sequestration potential in intercropping system.

Winter wheat yield and nitrous oxide emissions in response to cowpea-based green manure and nitrogen fertilization. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of cowpea green manure and inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizers on yields of winter wheat and soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). The comparisons included cowpea grown solely as green manure where all biomass was terminated at maturity by tillage, summer fallow treatments with 90 kg N ha(-1)as urea (90-N), and no fertilization (control) at planting of winter wheat. Fluxes of N2O were measured by closed chamber methods after soil incorporation of cowpea in autumn (October-November) and harvesting of winter wheat in summer (June-August). Growth and yields of winter wheat and N concentrations in grain and straw were also measured. Cowpea produced 9.5 Mg ha(-1)shoot biomass with 253 kg N ha(-1)at termination. Although soil moisture was favorable for denitrification after soil incorporation of cowpea biomass, low concentrations of soil mineral N restricted emissions of N2O from cowpea treatment. However, increased concentrations of soil mineral N and large rainfall-induced emissions were recorded from the cowpea treatment during summer. Growth of winter wheat, yield, and grain N concentrations were lowest in response to cowpea treatment and highest in 90-N treatment. In conclusion, late terminated cowpea may reduce yield of winter wheat and increase emissions of N2O outside of wheat growing seasons due to poor synchronization of N mineralization from cowpea biomass with N-demand of winter wheat.

Nitrous oxide emission and sweet potato yield in upland soil: Effects of different type and application rate of composted animal manures. The aims of this study were to determine type and application rate of composted animal manure to optimize sweet potato yield relative to N2O emissions from upland soils. To this end, the study was conducted on upland soils amended with different types and rates of composted animal manure and located at two geographically different regions of South Korea. Field trials were established at Miryang and Yesan in South Korea during the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) growing season over 2 years: 2017 (Year 1) and 2018 (Year 2). Three composted animal manures (chicken, cow, and pig) were applied at the rates of 0,10, and 20 Mg ha(-1) to upland soils in both locations. In both Years and locations, manure type did not affected significantly cumulative N2O emissions from soil during the sweet potato growing season or the belowground biomass of sweet potato. However, application rate of animal manures affected significantly the cumulative N2O emission, nitrogen (N) in soil, and belowground biomass of sweet potato. An increase in cumulative N2O emission with application rates of animal manures was related to total N and inorganic N concentration in soil. The belowground biomass yield of sweet potato but also the cumulative N2O emission increased with increasing application rate of composted animal manures up to 7.6 and 16.0 Mg ha(-1) in Miryang and Yesan, respectively. To reduce N2O emission from arable soil while increasing crop yield, composted animal manures should be applied at less than application rate that produce the maximum belowground biomass of sweet potato.

The global potential for mitigating nitrous oxide emissions from croplands. Agricultural activities contribute almost half of the total anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) 2 O) emissions, but proper assessment of mitigation measures is hampered by large uncertainties during the quantification of cropland N2O 2 O emissions and mitigation potentials. This review summarizes the up-to-date datasets and approaches to provide spatially explicit and crop-specific assessment of the global mitigation potentials. Here, we show that global cropland N2O 2 O emissions have quadrupled to 1.2 Tg N2O-N 2 O-N year- 1 over 1961-2020. The mitigation potential is 0.7 Tg N2O-N 2 O-N without compromising the crop production, with 86% from optimizing nitrogen fertilization, three-quarters (78%) from maize (22%), vegetables, and fruits (16%), other crops (15%), wheat (13%), and rice (12%), and over 80% from South Asia, China, the European Union, other American countries, the United States, and Southeast Asia. More accurate estimation of cropland N2O 2 O mitigation potentials requires extending the N2O 2 O observation network, improving modeling capacity, quantifying the feasibility of mitigation measures, and seeking additional mitigation measures.

Irrigation System, Rather than Nitrogen Fertilizer Application, Affects the Quantities of Functional Genes Related to N2O Production in Potato Cropping. The spatial and temporal distribution of water and nitrogen supply affects soil-borne nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. In this study, the effects of different irrigation technologies (no irrigation, sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation) and nitrogen (N) application types (no fertilizer, broadcasted and within irrigation water) on N2O flux rates and the quantities of functional genes involved in the N cycle in potato cropping were investigated over an entire season. The volume of irrigation water affected microbial N2O production, with the highest N2O flux rates found under sprinkler irrigation conditions, followed by drip and no irrigation. Nitrifier denitrification was identified as the potential pre-dominant pathway stimulated by fluctuations in aerobic-anaerobic soil conditions, especially under sprinkler irrigation. Regarding the different N application types, increased N use efficiency under fertigation was expected. However, N2O flux rates were not significantly reduced compared to broadcasted N application under drip irrigation. On average, the N2O fluxes were higher during the first half of the season, which was accompanied by a low N use efficiency of the potato crops. Potato crops mainly require N at later growth stages. Due to the different water and nutrient demand of potatoes, an adjusted application of fertilizer and water based on crop demand could reduce N2O emissions.

A 4-year field measurement of N2O emissions from a maize-wheat rotation system as influenced by partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer. Soil N2O emissions depend on the status of stoichiometric balance between organic C and inorganic N. As a beneficial management practice to sustain soil fertility and crop productivity, partial substitution of organic fertilizers (OFs) for synthetic fertilizers (SFs) can directly affect this balance status and regulate N2O emissions. However, no multi-year field studies of N2O emissions under different ratios of OFs to SFs have been performed. We conducted a 4-year experiment to measure N2O emissions in a maize-wheat rotation in central China. Six treatments were included: total SF (TS), total OF, no N fertilizer, and ratios of to SF with 1: 2 (LO), 1: 1 (MO), and 2: 1 (HO), based on N content. Two incubation experiments were performed to further interpret the field data. In the first year, cumulative N2O emissions (kg N ha(-1)) in LO, MO, and HO were 4.59, 4.68, and 3.59, respectively, significantly lower than in TS (6.67). However, from the second year onwards, organic substitution did not reduce N2O emissions and even significantly enhanced them in the fourth year relative to TS. Soil respiration under OF-amended soils increased over the course of the experiment. From the second year onwards, there was no marked difference in mineral N concentrations between OF- and SF-amended soils. OF caused a drop in soil pH. Cumulative N2O was negatively correlated with pH. Long-term organic substitution enhanced N2O emissions produced via denitrification rather than nitrification and resulted in higher temperature sensitivity of N2O emissions than TS. The enhanced N2O emissions from the OF-treated soils were mainly attributable to accelerated OF decomposition, increased denitrification-N2O emissions, and lessened N2O reduction due to lower pH and greater NO3-. These results indicate that OF substitution can reduce N2O emissions in the first year, but in the long-term it can increase emissions, especially as soils warm.

Quantifying On-Farm Nitrous Oxide Emission Reductions in Food Supply Chains. Reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agriculture is critical to limiting future global warming. In response, a growing number of food retailers and manufacturers have committed to reducing N2O emissions from their vast networks of farmer suppliers by providing technical assistance and financial incentives. A key challenge for such companies is demonstrating that their efforts are leading to meaningful progress toward their climate mitigation commitments. We show that a simplified version of soil surface nitrogen (N) balance-or partial N balance-the difference between N inputs to and outputs from a farm field (fertilizer N minus crop N), is a robust indicator of direct N2O emissions from fields with maize and other major rainfed temperate-region crops. Furthermore, we present a generalized environmental model that will allow food-supply-chain companies to translate aggregated and anonymized changes in average N balance across their supplying farms into aggregated changes in N2O emissions. This research is an important first step, based on currently available science, in helping companies demonstrate the impact of their sustainability efforts. C1 [Eagle, A. J.; McLellan, E.

Daytime, temporal, and seasonal variations of N2O emissions in an upland cropping system of the humid tropics. Nitrous oxide (N2O) contributes to global climate change, and its emission from soil-crop systems depend on soil, environmental, and anthropogenic factors. Thus, we evaluated the variability of N2O emissions measured by microchambers (cross section: 184 cm(2)) from a groundnut-fallow-maize-fallow cropping system of the humid tropics. The crops received inorganic nitrogen (N) plus crop residues (NC), inorganic N alone as ammonium sulfate (RN), and half of the inorganic N along with crop residues and chicken manure (N1/2CM), amounting for the crop rotation to 322, 180, and 400 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The N2O fluxes during the groundnut-maize crop rotation were log-normally distributed, and the frequency distributions were positively skewed. Daytime changes in N2O fluxes were inconsistent, and the 50% of total N2O emission during the 12 h measurement periods was attained earlier under maize (-11 : 00 h) than groundnut covers (- 13: 00 h). Spatial variability in each treatment with eight gas chambers was large but smaller during the cropping periods than the fallow, indicating masking efficiency of crop covers for the soil heterogeneity that was accelerated presumably by antecedent climatic variables. The temporal variability of N2O emissions was also large (coefficients of variation, CV, ranged from 60 to 81%), involving both input differences between treatments and measurement periods. As such, the relative deviation from the annual mean of total N2O emission was high during the period after a large N application with a maximum of +480%, due to addition of chicken manure. The seasonal contribution of summer and monsoon to N2O emissions was insignificant. However, intensive rainfall negatively (-0.65**) and the amount of added N from either source positively (0.83***) correlated with the integrated N2O emissions, and those were exponential. Results suggest that around noon (12: 00 h) gas collection could represent well the daily N2O fluxes, increasing the number or size of the gas chambers could minimize the large variability, and mainly the rainfall and N inputs regulated its emissions in the humid tropics of Malaysia.

Soil greenhouse gas fluxes and global warming potential in four high-yielding maize systems. Crop intensification is often thought to increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but studies in which crop management is optimized to exploit crop yield potential are rare. We conducted a field study in eastern Nebraska, USA to quantify GHG emissions, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and the net global warming potential (GWP) in four irrigated systems: continuous maize with recommended best management practices (CC-rec) or intensive management (CC-int) and maize-soybean rotation with recommended (CS-rec) or intensive management (CS-int). Grain yields of maize and soybean were generally within 80-100% of the estimated site yield potential. Large soil surface carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were mostly associated with rapid crop growth, high temperature and high soil water content. Within each crop rotation, soil CO2 efflux under intensive management was not consistently higher than with recommended management. Owing to differences in residue inputs, SOC increased in the two continuous maize systems, but decreased in CS-rec or remained unchanged in CS-int. N2O emission peaks were mainly associated with high temperature and high soil water content resulting from rainfall or irrigation events, but less clearly related to soil NO3-N levels. N2O fluxes in intensively managed systems were only occasionally greater than those measured in the CC-rec and CS-rec systems. Fertilizer-induced N2O emissions ranged from 1.9% to 3.5% in 2003, from 0.8% to 1.5% in 2004 and from 0.4% to 0.5% in 2005, with no consistent differences among the four systems. All four cropping systems where net sources of GHG. However, due to increased soil C sequestration continuous maize systems had lower GWP than maize-soybean systems and intensive management did not cause a significant increase in GWP. Converting maize grain to ethanol in the two continuous maize systems resulted in a net reduction in life cycle GHG emissions of maize ethanol relative to petrol-based gasoline by 33-38%. Our study provided evidence that net GHG emissions from agricultural systems can be kept low when management is optimized toward better exploitation of the yield potential. Major components for this included (i) choosing the right combination of adopted varieties, planting date and plant population to maximize crop biomass productivity, (ii) tactical water and nitrogen (N) management decisions that contributed to high N use efficiency and avoided extreme N2O emissions, and (iii) a deep tillage and residue management approach that favored the build-up of soil organic matter from large amounts of crop residues returned.

Spatial variability of nitrous oxide emissions from croplands and unmanaged natural ecosystems across a large environmental gradient. Atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, with long atmospheric residence time and a global warming potential 273 times higher than CO2. N2O emissions are mainly produced from soils and are influenced by biotic and abiotic factors that can be substantially altered by anthropogenic activities, such as land uses, especially when unmanaged natural ecosystems are replaced by croplands or other uses. In this study, we evaluated the spatial variability of N2O emissions from croplands (maize, soybean, wheat, and sugar cane crops), paired with the natural grasslands or forests that they replaced across a wide environmental gradient in Argentina, and identified the key drivers governing the spatial variability of N2O emissions using structural equation modeling. We conducted on-farm field measurements over 2 years at nine different sites, including a wide environmental gradient (mean rainfall from 679 to 1090 mm year-1 and mean temperatures from 13.8 degrees C to 21.3 degrees C), with diverse plant species life forms, and ecosystems, from the Semiarid Chaco forests in the Northwest of Argentina to the Pampas grasslands in the Southeast. On average, agricultural systems emitted more than twice N2O (+120%), had higher soil water content (+9%), higher soil temperatures (+3%), higher soil nitrate content (+19%) but lower ammonium (-33%) than natural ecosystems. We found that land use was the main driver of N2O emissions by directly affecting soil NO3- contents in both natural ecosystems and croplands. Urgent management practices aimed at reducing N2O emissions from croplands are needed to mitigate their contributions to global climate change.

N2O emission and the N2O/(N2O + N2) product ratio of denitrification as controlled by available carbon substrates and nitrate concentrations. Amending agricultural soils with organic residues is frequently recommended to improve soil fertility and to sequester carbon for counteracting global warming. However, such amendments will enhance microbial respiration, hence denitrification. Therefore, the assessment of effects on global warming must take N2O emission and the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio of denitrification into account. There are some indications that the product ratio of denitrification is positively correlated with the ratio of available NO3- and available organic C in soils, but more research is needed to unravel quantitative relationships in well defined experiments. We conducted two laboratory incubation experiments, with the objective (i) to test the impact of the application of various N containing organic substrates including biogas residue on the denitrification rate and on N2O emission, and (ii) to investigate the effect of various NO3- concentrations on the denitrification rate and the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio under standardized anoxic conditions in soils collected from long-term organic or inorganic fertilizer plots. In experiment 1, we found that biogas residue was more recalcitrant than maize straw, despite a high concentration of soluble organic C. High respiration (treatments with maize straw and sucrose) resulted in a transient peak in N2O emission, declining rapidly towards zero as nitrate concentrations reached less than 20 mg NO3--N kg(-1) dry soil. Application of biogas residue had a more moderate effect on soil respiration and denitrification, and resulted in a more long lasting peak in N2O emission. The results were interpreted as a result of a gradual increase in the relative activity of N2O reductase (thus lowering of the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio of denitrification) throughout the incubation, most likely controlled by concentration of available NO3- in soil. In the second experiment, we found low N2O/(N2O N-2) product ratios for the treatment where NO3- concentrations were <= 2 mM, and the ratios were clearly lower in manure fertilized than in mineral fertilizer treated soil. Much higher N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratios were found for the treatments with >= 10 mM NO3-, and the ratios were remarkably independent of the soil's fertilizer history. We conclude that (i) in N-fertilized agricultural soils, application of organic matter with high contents of labile C may trigger denitrification-derived N2O emission whereas (ii) in soils with low NO3- contents such application may substantially lower the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio and hence N2O emission.

How does straw returning combined with nitrogen fertilizer drive N2O emission in wheat-maize rotation system. Straw returning not only improves carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools but also increases soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which poses a threat to the sustainable development of agriculture. To investigate the effect of straw return combined with nitrogen fertilizer on labile C and N pools in the soil and short-term response to soil N2O emissions in wheat-maize rotation system. The consecutive field experiment was conducted from 2019 to 2021. Single factor randomized block design was used in the experiment design, with no straw returning and no fertilizer (CK), no straw returning and nitrogen fertilizer (S0N) and straw returning combined with nitrogen fertilizer (SN). The results indicated that the SN and S0N treatments significantly (p < .05) increased N2O emissions by 170.45% (2.43 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and 119.5% (1.70 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), soil organic carbon (SOC) by 17.23% and 14.50% and soil total nitrogen (STN) by 58.50% and 31.50% respectively. In the 2020-2021 growing season, The soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) content of the SN and S0N treatments were higher than those of CK in the winter wheat seedling, winter wheat jointing, winter wheat booting, summer maize seedling and summer maize bell-mouth stages. The structural equation model (SEM) indicated that C:N and NO3--N were the major drivers that increased soil N2O emissions, but SMBN was the main driver that decreased soil N2O emissions. The SN and S0N treatments significantly increased soil N2O emissions by increasing the NO3--N content. However, compared with the CK and S0N treatments, the SN treatment mitigated soil N2O emissions by increasing the SMBN content. More importantly, compared with CK treatment, SN treatment increased annual yield by 48.41% and 34.52%, the SN treatment could effectively improve the soil C and N pools. Therefore, straw return combined with nitrogen fertilizer (SN) may be the best choice of the treatments tested for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving green and sustainable development.

Characterizing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Global Warming Potential of Wheat-Maize Cropping Systems in Response to Organic Amendments in Eutric Regosols, China. Characterizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global warming potential (GWP) has become a key step in the estimation of atmospheric GHG concentrations and their potential mitigation by cropland management. However, the impacts of organic amendments on GHG, GWP, and yield-scaled GWP on cropland have not been well documented. Here, we investigate four amendment treatments (no amendment, mineral fertilizers, and pig slurry or crop residue combined with mineral fertilizers) during a two-year field experiment in rain-fed wheat-maize cropping systems. The results show that the average annual cumulative methane (CH4) flux ranged from -2.60 to -2.97 kg center dot C center dot ha(-1)while nitrous oxide (N2O) flux ranged from 0.44 to 4.58 kg center dot N center dot ha(-1)across all four treatments. N2O emissions were significantly correlated with soil inorganic nitrogen (i.e., NH4+-N and NO3--N), and soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during both the winter wheat and summer maize seasons. On average, organic amendments combined with mineral fertilizers increased the annual GWP by 26-74% and yield-scaled GWP by 19-71% compared to those under only mineral fertilizers application. This study indicates that the fertilization strategy for Eutric Regosols can shift from only mineral fertilizers to organic amendments combined with mineral fertilizers, which can help mitigate GHG emissions and GWP while maintaining crop yields.

Effect of Fertilization on Methane and Nitrous Oxide Emissions and Global Warming Potential on Agricultural Land in China: A Meta-Analysis. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from croplands are primarily attributed to nitrogen (N) fertilization in agricultural production. However, the interactive effects of various agricultural management practices, climatic conditions, soil properties, and fertilization on non-CO2 GHG emissions (specifically methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)) and gross global warming potential (GGWP) have been scarcely discussed. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of 326 agricultural treatments in China from 76 literature sources to elucidate the relationship between the response ratio (RR) of GGWP (GGWP RR), CH4 (CH4 RR), and N2O emissions (N2O RR) and various explanatory variables using redundancy analysis. Generally, nitrogen fertilizer application increased the N2O and CH4 emissions and GGWP by 120.0%, 32.5%, and 107.9%, respectively. We found that the GGWP RR was closely related to the rate of organic fertilizer application and initial bulk density, while it showed a negative association with the initial total soil nitrogen content. We found that CH4-RR was positively associated with the rate of synthetic fertilizer application, and N2O-RR exhibited a positive association with initial soil organic carbon and annual mean precipitation. Notably, the total fertilizer application rate had the most significant impact on both the GGWP RR and the N2O RR, while mean annual precipitation contributed the most to CH4-RR. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis using a machine learning model suggested that the GGWP RR was more sensitive to synthetic fertilizer than to straw application, and reducing synthetic fertilizer by 30% from the current condition is likely to be the most effective way to alleviate the effect of fertilization on GGWP.

Effect of soil tillage and N fertilization on N2O mitigation in maize in the Brazilian Cerrado. The management system of soils and nitrogen application can cause impacts on the N2O emissions produced by the agricultural sector. In the establishment of practices of greenhouse gas mitigation for this sector, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil tillage, with and without N fertilization, on N2O emissions from Oxisols under rainfed maize in the Brazilian Cerrado region. The managements were of monoculture maize under conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), with (1) and without (0) application of N fertilizer (0 and 257 kg N ha(-1)). From November 2014 to October 2015, gas emissions were measured. The soil and climate variables were measured and related to the N2O fluxes. In the N-fertilized treatments, N2O fluxes were higher (P < 0.01), ranging from -21 mu g m(-2) h(-1) to 548 mu g m(-2) h(-1) N2O under conventional tillage and from -21 mu g m(-2) h(-1) to 380 mu g m(-2) h(-1) N2O under no-tillage, compared with -6 to 93 mu g m(-2) h(-1) N2O from systems without N application. There was a combined effect of mineral N and water-filled pore space for most N2O fluxes. The emission factors of N2O during maize cultivation were lower than the standard factor (1%) established by the International Panel of Climate Change. During the plant crop cycle, 30% less N2O was emitted from the N-fertilized no-tillage than from the conventional tillage. For the total cumulative N2O (crop cycle + fallow), the N2O emissions from NT1 and CT1 were not different, but 10x higher than those from the respective crops without N fertilization. To the emissions per unit of grain yield, CT1 and NT1 emitted 769 and 391 mg N2O kg(-1) grain produced, respectively, and NT1 was most efficient in fertilizer-into-product conversion. Under maize cultivation, the soil acted as N2O source, regardless of the management. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Quantifying soil nitrous oxide emissions in spring freezing-thawing period over different vegetation types in Northeast China. Environmental changes significantly alter the structure, diversity and activity of soil microbial communities during spring freezing-thawing period, leading to changes in the soil microbial nitrogen cycle. Changes in N2O fluxes after land use conversion from primary forest to secondary forest, Korean pine plantation and cropland in northeast China have not been quantified. Field experiments were conducted to measure soil N2O fluxes in a primary forest, two secondary forests, a Korean pine plantation, and one maize field in a temperate region in northeast China from 2017-03-06 to 2017-05-28. During the experimental period, the soil was exclusively a nitrogen source for all land uses. We found that N2O emissions ranged from 15.63 to 68.74 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.33 to 2.10 kg ha(-1) during the period. Cumulative (NO)-O-2 emissions from the maize field were significantly higher than that from primary forest, Korean pine plantation, hardwood forest, and Betula platyphylla forest by 262.1% to 536.4%. Compared with other ecosystems in similar studies, the N2O emission rates of all ecosystem types in this study were low during the spring thaw period. Stepwise multiple linear regression indicated that there were significant correlations between N2O emissions and environmental factors (air temperature and soil temperature, soil water content, soil pH, NH4+-N, NO3--N, and soil organic carbon). The results showed that conversion of land use from primary forest to hardwood forest, Korean pine plantation or maize field greatly increased soil N2O emissions during spring freezing-thawing period, and N2O emissions from primary forest were almost the same as those from Betula platyphylla forest.

Estimating N2O processes during grassland renewal and grassland conversion to maize cropping using N2O isotopocules. RationaleEnhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions can occur following grassland break-up for renewal or conversion to maize cropping, but knowledge about N2O production pathways and N2O reduction to N-2 is very limited. A promising tool to address this is the combination of mass spectrometric analysis of N2O isotopocules and an enhanced approach for data interpretation. MethodsThe isotopocule mapping approach was applied to field data using a N-15(N2O)sp and O-18(N2O) map to simultaneously determine N2O production pathways contribution and N2O reduction for the first time. Based on the isotopic composition of N2O produced and literature values for specific N2O pathways, it was possible to distinguish: (i) heterotrophic bacterial denitrification and/or nitrifier denitrification and (ii) nitrification and/or fungal denitrification and the contribution of N2O reduction. ResultsThe isotopic composition of soil-emitted N2O largely resembled the known end-member values for bacterial denitrification. The isotopocule mapping approach indicated different effects of N2O reduction on the isotopic composition of soil-emitted N2O for the two soils under study. Differing N2O production pathways in different seasons were not observed, but management events and soil conditions had a significant impact on pathway contribution and N2O reduction. N2O reduction data were compared with a parallel N-15-labelling experiment. ConclusionsThe field application of the isotopocule mapping approach opens up new prospects for studying N2O production and consumption of N2O in soil simultaneously based on mass spectrometric analysis of natural abundance N2O. However, further studies are needed in order to properly validate the isotopocule mapping approach.

Short-Term Assessment of Nitrous Oxide and Methane Emissions on a Crop Yield Basis in Response to Different Organic Amendment Types in Sichuan Basin. Agriculture's goal to meet the needs of the increasing world population while reducing the environmental impacts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer use without compromising output has proven to be a challenge. Manure and composts have displayed the potential to increase soil fertility. However, their potential effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions have not been properly understood. Using field-scaled lysimeter experiments, we conducted a one-year study to investigate N2O and CH4 emissions, their combined global warming potential (GWP: N2O + CH4) and yield-scaled GWP in a wheat-maize system. One control and six different organic fertilizer treatments receiving different types but equal amounts of N fertilization were used: synthetic N fertilizer (NPK), 30% pig manure + 70% synthetic N fertilizer (PM30), 50% pig manure + 50% synthetic N fertilizer (PM50), 70% pig manure + 30% synthetic N fertilizer (PM70), 100% pig manure (PM100), 50% cow manure-crop residue compost + 50% synthetic N fertilizer (CMRC), and 50% pig manure-crop residue compost + 50% synthetic N fertilizer (PMRC). Seasonal cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.39 kg N ha(-1) for the PMRC treatment to 0.93 kg N ha(-1) for the NPK treatment. Similar CH4 uptakes were recorded across all treatments, with values ranging from -0.68 kg C ha(-1) for the PM50 treatment to -0.52 kg C ha(-1) for the PM30 treatment. Compared to the NPK treatment, all the organic-amended treatments significantly decreased N2O emission by 32-58% and GWP by 30-61%. However, among the manure-amended treatments, only treatments that consisted of inorganic N with lower or equal proportions of organic manure N treatments were found to reduce N2O emissions while maintaining crop yields at high levels. Moreover, of all the organic-amended treatments, PMRC had the lowest yield-scaled GWP, owing to its ability to significantly reduce N2O emissions while maintaining high crop yields, highlighting it as the most suitable organic fertilization treatment in Sichuan basin wheat-maize systems.

Fate of synthetic fertilizer nitrogen in a maize system depends on dairy manure type: insights from an isotopic tracing field study. Understanding the fate of fertilizer nitrogen (N) in cropping systems is critical to improving agricultural sustainability and minimizing environmental losses. However, efforts to trace fertilizer N are often complicated by manure application in dairy cropping systems. We used a stable isotope tracing approach to investigate how different manure products influence the fate of synthetic fertilizer N in a Midwestern maize silage system by tracking N-15-labled ammonium sulfate into crop biomass, soil organic matter fractions (particulate (POM) and mineral associated (MAOM)), and gaseous loss as nitrous oxide (N2O). Treatments included unprocessed liquid manure (LM), solid manure derived through chemical (CS) or physical (PS) separation, and a no-manure control (NM), combined with fertilizer rates of 90, 180, and 270 kg N ha(-1). Cumulative N2O emissions increased significantly with both manure application and higher fertilizer rates, with PS having lower emissions than LM following fertilizer application. Fertilizer contributed similar proportions to cumulative N2O emissions regardless of manure treatment. Total fertilizer N uptake by crops did not differ among manure treatments, but crops took up more fertilizer N at higher fertilizer application rates. Notably, application of CS and PS enhanced fertilizer N retention in the 0-15 cm soil MAOM pool compared to LM and NM. These findings highlight that although manure type does not significantly affect fertilizer N uptake by crops or fertilizer-derived N2O emissions, solid manures (i.e., CS and PS) can significantly increase fertilizer N retention in soils, offering potential benefits for long-term soil fertility and reduced N losses.

Soil Compaction, Both an Environmental and Agronomic Culprit: Increased Nitrous Oxide Emissions and Reduced Plant Nitrogen Uptake. With a burgeoning world population and growing demand for agricultural products, it will be necessary to strike a judicious balance between maintaining adequate N inputs and minimizing gaseous N losses in farming systems. Our objective in this study was to quantify the effects of soil compaction, N fertilization, and clay content on N2O emission from soil. Soil cropped to maize (Zea mays L.) was compacted by tractor wheel traffic or not compacted for consecutive years, and N fertilizer was applied at 0, 75, 150, and 300 kg N ha(-1) to both compaction treatments. Variability in clay content across the experimental plots allowed us to assess of the effects of texture on N2O response to compaction and N fertilization. Compaction, increasing N fertilization, and their interaction all significantly increased cumulative emissions of N2O during the growing season. There was a significant carryover effect, with higher N2O emissions observed in previously compacted soils in a subsequent year when soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was grown and no compaction or N fertilizer was applied. Nitrous oxide emissions scaled against plant N uptake showed significant positive response to both compaction and N fertilizer. Clay content did not significantly affect N2O emissions, but its role became apparent when the emissions were scaled by N uptake. This scaling amplified the deleterious effects of compaction on gaseous N losses from soil because compaction both increased N2O emissions and decreased yield and plant N uptake. In contrast, increasing N fertilizer increased both and therefore did not have as large an effect on the scaled N2O emissions. C1 [Gregorich, E. G.; McLaughlin, N. B.; Lapen, D. R.; Ma, B.

High-Resolution Estimation of Cropland N2O Emissions in China Based on Machine Learning Algorithms. Over the past two decades, agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions have increased significantly, further intensifying their impact on global warming. Accurate emission estimates are essential for developing effective N2O-mitigation strategies. However, the high-resolution, dynamic simulations of emissions and comprehensive analysis of their driving mechanisms in China remain unclear. In this study, we constructed a city-level agricultural N2O emission inventory covering 336 cities in China from 2000 to 2022 based on multi-source data and machine learning algorithms. Results demonstrate that China's cropland N2O emissions averaged 390 Gg year(-1) during 2000 and 2022, exhibiting sustained growth until 2016, followed by a 13% reduction driven by the nationwide Fertilizer Reduction Policy implementation. Maize, wheat, and rice are identified as the main sources of cropland N2O emissions. Spatially, higher N2O emission intensities were concentrated in eastern China, and hotspots were identified in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain (5.23 kg ha(-1)) and the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Plain (2.95 kg ha(-1)). These emission patterns are primarily influenced by soil organic carbon, crop type, and fertilizer-management practices. This study provides robust data support and methodological basis for formulating agricultural mitigation policies.

Agricultural management could reduce soil N2O emissions while increasing grain yields via enhancing soil moisture harvesting and improving soil nutrient status. Intercropping can improve system productivity, but the effect of intercropping integrated with conservation tillage practices on soil N2O emissions remains unclear at the present stage. A 4-yr field experiment was performed in northwest China to examine soil moisture harvesting, soil nutrient status, and soil N2O emissions of wheat-maize intercropping with stubble residues and films management. We found that intercropping increased crop yields and reduced soil N2O emissions over monocultures. Across the intercropping treatments, NTSMFI (no-tillage with mulching stubbles and re-using residual films) and NTSSFI (no-tillage with standing stubbles and re-using residual films) boosted grain-yields by 13.8-17.1 % and 12.9-15.4 % over CTFI (conventional tillage without returning stubbles and mulching new films). NTSMFI and NTSSFI reduced soil N2O emissions by 18.4-28.7 % and 15.5-24.9 % compared to CTFI, respectively. So, NTSMFI and NTSSFI obtained a higher soil N2O emission efficiency than CTFI. The greater effect on soil N2O emissions reduction was detected in NTSMFI, and decreased by 5.1-5.4 % over NTSSFI. The main reason for NTSMFI to improve grain-yields and reduce soil N2O emissions was to enhance soil moisture harvesting and optimize the soil nutrient status. Compared to CTFI, NTSMFI increased the ratio of transpiration to evaporation by 14.4-32.0 %, improved soil organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations, and soil C:N ratio of 0 to 60 cm soil depth by 14.1 %, 7.1 %, and 6.5 %, respectively. Adopting an environmentally clean strategy exemplified by NTSMFI was recommended as an effective technique for increasing-yields and reducing soil N2O emissions in arid irrigated regions.

Utilizing brackish water for irrigation is a key strategy for mitigating water-use conflicts across industries and promoting sustainable agriculture. Understanding the emission patterns and underlying mechanisms of carbon dioxide (CO2) 2 ) and nitrous oxide (N2O) 2 O) under saline conditions is of great practical significance for developing optimized water and salt management strategies that promote water conservation and emission reduction. Therefore, we conducted an indoor incubation experiment using five different salinity gradients (0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 7.0 g/L) to analyze the effects of salinity gradients on soil microorganisms and related enzyme activities and explain the mechanisms of the impact on soil COQ emissions. Additionally, we performed an acetylene inhibition experiment to analyze the effects of salinity on soil NQO production pathways (autotrophic nitrification, heterotrophic nitrification, and denitrification). Our findings indicated that higher salinity levels inhibited the growth of soil bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes and reduced microbial carbon metabolism. This led to decreased activities of key soil enzymes, such as cellulase, sucrase, and alpha-glucosidase, thus suppressing soil CO2 2 emissions. Higher salinity levels were associated with increased soil N2O 2 O emissions. As salinity intensified, the contribution of autotrophic nitrification to N2O 2 O emissions decreased from 89.79 % to 64.95 %, whereas that of denitrification significantly increased from 8.61 % to 33.29 % during the 2nd to 4th days of cultivation. When the irrigation water salinity was lower than 3.0 g/L, its effect on the soil microbial community and enzyme activity was relatively minor and did not cause excessive soil CO2 2 and N2O 2 O emissions. These insights will be instrumental in shaping water and salt management practices that align with sustainable agriculture and greenhouse gas reduction goals.

Potential role of compost and green manure amendment to mitigate soil GHGs emissions in Mediterranean drip irrigated maize production systems. Organic fertilization can preserve soil organic matter (SOM) and is foreseen as an effective strategy to reduce green house gases (GHGs) emissions in agriculture. However, its effectiveness needs to be clarified under specific climate, crop management and soil characteristics. A field experiment was carried out in a Mediterranean drip irrigated maize system to assess the pattern of soil CO2 and N2O fluxes in response to the replacement of a typical bare fallow-maize cycle under urea fertilization (130 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) (CONV) with: (i) bare fallow-maize cycles under two doses of compost (COM1 and COM2, 130 and 260 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively) and (ii) a vetch-maize cycle, with vetch incorporation as green manure (130 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) (GMAN). Along the maize period (MP), reduced daily N2O emissions were detected in organic treated soils compared to CONV, mainly in the first stages of the cultivation, thanks to the slow release of available nitrogen from the organic substrates. Cumulative N2O fluxes (kg N2O-N ha(-1)) in MP scored to 0.24, 0.14, 0.12 and 0.085 for CONV, COM1, COM2 and GMAN, respectively, with significantly lower emissions in GMAN respect to CONV. CO2 fluxes partially reflected the ranking observed for maize yields, with cumulated values (Mg CO2-C ha(-1)) of 2.2, 1.5, 2.1, 2.1 for CONV, COM1, COM2 and GMAN, respectively, and significantly lower in COM1 respect to the other treatments. During the fallow period (FP), compared to CONV (0.77 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) and 0.25 kg N2O -N ha(-1)), enhanced GHG fluxes were detected in COM treatments (about 0.90 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) and 0.37 kg N2O N- ha(-1), as averaged values from COM1 and COM2), likely driven by the slow prolonged mineralization of the added organic matter. GMAN showed comparable CO2 (0.82 Mg CO2-C ha(-1)) and N2O emissions (0.30 kg N2O-N ha(-1)), in consequence of restrained post-harvest residual N coupled with the counteracting effect of vetch uptake. Respect to the total yearly GHG emissions in CONV (about 194 kg CO2 eq ha(-1) y(-1)), the overall results showed commensurate slightly higher GWP in COM treatments (+11% as averaged value from COM1 and COM2). The yield -scaled global warming potential (GWP) resulted 60% higher and nearly doubled for COM2 and COM1 respectively, according to the lower COM yields, markedly dampening at halved compost dose. GMAN appeared the best performing organic treatment, with lower GWP (-27%) and competitive yields respect to CONV. All treatments showed N2O emission factors consistently lower compared with the default IPCC 1% value. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Towards efficient N cycling in intensive maize: role of cover crops and application methods of digestate liquid fraction. Digestate, a by-product of biogas production, is widely recognized as a promising renewable nitrogen (N) source with high potential to replace synthetic fertilizers. Yet, inefficient digestate use can lead to pollutant N losses as ammonia (NH3) volatilization, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO - 3) leaching. Cover crops (CCs) may reduce some of these losses and recycle the N back into the soil after incorporation, but the effect on the N balance depends on the CC species. In a one--year field study, we tested two application methods (i.e., surface broadcasting, BDC; and shallow injection, INJ) of the liquid fraction of separated co-digested cattle slurry (digestate liquid fraction [DLF]), combined with different winter cover crop (CC) options (i.e., rye, white mustard or bare fallow), as starter fertilizer for maize. Later, side--dressing with urea was required to fulfil maize N--requirements. We tested treatment effects on yield, N--uptake, N--use efficiency parameters, and N--losses in the form of N2O emissions and NO - 3 leaching. CC development and biomass production were strongly affected by their contrasting frost tolerance, with spring--regrowth for rye, while mustard was winter killed. After the CCs, injection of DLF increased N2O emissions significantly compared with BDC (emission factor of 2.69% vs. 1.66%). Nitrous oxide emissions accounted for a small part (11%-13%) of the overall yield-scaled N losses (0.46-0.97 kg N Mg grain-1). The adoption of CCs reduced fall NO - 3 leaching, being 51% and 64% lower for mustard and rye than under bare soil. In addition, rye reduced NO - 3 leaching during spring and summer after termination by promoting N immobilization, thus leading to -57% lower annual leaching losses compared with mustard. DLF application method modified N-loss pathways, but not the cumulative yield-scaled N losses. Overall, these insights contribute to inform an evidence-based design of cropping systems in which nutrients are recycled more efficiently.

Plastic-shed vegetable cultivation alters soil gross nitrogen transformation rates and nitrous oxide production pathways. Plastic-shed vegetable cultivation is characterized by high nitrogen (N) application rates, frequent irrigation and multiple cropping, probably leading to different soil N transformation rates compared to open-field cultivation. However, how continuous cultivation of vegetables under plastic sheds affects soil N transformation rates and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remains unclear. Here, a 15N-tracing experiment in combination with the qPCR technique was used to investigate the effects of conversion from conventional open-field cultivation to plastic-shed vegetable cultivation, as well as the age of this shift, on soil gross N transformation rates, N2O emission pathways and associated microbial abundances. Five typical fields, including a wheat-maize rotation system field and four adjacent plastic-shed vegetable fields under cultivation for 2, 5, 12 and 20 years, were selected. Soil gross N mineralization rates increased significantly after two years after conversion from a wheat-maize rotation system to a plastic-shed vegetable system, and then decreased with an increase in plan-tation age, which could be attributed to decreased soil total phosphorus availability. Long-term vegetable plantation under plastic-shed decreased soil gross autotrophic nitrification rates significantly by decreasing ammonia-oxidizing bacteria abundance probably due to decreasing soil pH. Such decreased rates of autotrophic nitrification further led to decreased N2O emissions under plastic-shed cultivation. Under long-term plastic-shed cultivation (> 2 years), negligible gross nitrate-N (NO3--N) immobilization rates were observed due to the pref-erential use of ammonium-N by soil microbes, which was probably responsible for rapid NO3--N accumulation in soils. Overall, these results could be of help to elucidate the mechanisms of soil N2O emission and NO3--N accumulation in plastic-shed vegetable fields.

Carbon Dioxide and Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Naturally Occurring Sulfate-Based Saline Soils at Different Moisture Contents. Soil salinization may negatively affect microbial processes related to carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. A short-term laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of soil electrical conductivity (EC) and moisture content on CO2 and N2O emissions from sulfate-based natural saline soils. Three separate 100-m long transects were established along the salinity gradient on a salt-affected agricultural field at Mooreton, North Dakota, USA. Surface soils were collected from four equally spaced sampling positions within each transect, at the depths of 0-15 and 15-30 cm. In the laboratory, artificial soil cores were formed combining soils from both the depths in each transect, and incubated at 60% and 90% water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 25 degrees C. The measured depth-weighted EC of the saturated paste extract (ECe). across the sampling positions ranged from 0.43 to 4.65 dS m(-1). Potential nitrogen (N) mineralization rate and CO2 emissions decreased with increasing soil ECe, but the relative decline in soil CO2 emissions with increasing ECe was smaller at 60% WFPS than at 90% WFPS. At 60% WFPS, soil N2O emissions decreased from 133 mu g N2O-N kg(-1) soil at ECe < 0.50 dS m(-1) to 72 ug N2O-N kg(-1) soil at ECe = 4.65 dS m(-1). In contrast, at 90% WFPS, soil N2O emissions increased from 262 mu g N2O-N kg(-1) soil at ECe = 0.81 dS m(-1) to 849 sg N2O-N kg(-1) soil at ECe = 4.65 dS m(-1), suggesting that N2O emissions were linked to both soil ECe and moisture content. Therefore, spatial variability in soil ECe and pattern of rainfall over the season need to be considered when up-scaling N2O and CO2 emissions from field to landscape scales.

Nitrous oxide fluxes and mineral nitrogen. Soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics following application of pig slurry for the 19th consecutive year: II. Nitrous oxide fluxes and mineral nitrogen. Agricultural soils often receive annual applications of manure for long periods. Our objective was to quantify the effects of 19 consecutive years of pig (Sus scrofa) slurry (PS) application to a loamy soil (loamy, mixed, frigid Aeric Haplaquept) on N2O emissions. Soil surface N2O fluxes (F-N2O) were measured 36 times in 1 yr. Nitrous oxide concentration profiles, soil NH4+- and NO3--N contents, denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA), and denitrification rate (DR) in soil were also determined to explain the variation in F-N2O. Long-term (19 Jr) treatments on continuous silage maize (Zea mays L.) were 60 (PS60) and 120 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (PS120) of pig slurry and a control receiving mineral fertilizer at a dose of 150 kg ha(-1) each of N, P2O5, and K2O. Denitrifying enzyme activity, soil N2O concentrations, and F-N2O (<25 ng m(-2) s(-1)) were low in the control plots receiving mineral fertilizer. Annual applications of PS to the soil for 18 Jr had positive residual effects on the DEA compared with the long-term fertilized control plots. Following PS application, there was a strong and rapid increase of F-N2O (np to 350 ng m(-2) s(-1)) on manured plots. The PS-induced F-N2O increased with increasing quantity of PS, probably as the result of a greater availability of NO3--N for denitrification. The effects of PS on F-N2O were mostly limited to the 30 d following application, with low nuxes (<10 ng m(-2) s(-1)) during the rest of the measurement period. Total N2O-N emissions represented 0.62, 1.23, and 1.65% of total N applied in control, PS60, and PS120 plots, respectively. These emission factors for the PS plots agreed with values previously suggested for N-fertilized soils (1.25%). C1 Agr & Agri Food Canada, Soils & Crops Res & Dev Ctr, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 2J3, Canada.

Consequences of field N2O emissions for the environmental sustainability of plant-based biofuels produced within an organic farming system. One way of reducing the emissions of fossil fuel-derived carbon dioxide (CO2) is to replace fossil fuels with biofuels produced from agricultural biomasses or residuals. However, cultivation of soils results in emission of other greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially nitrous oxide (N2O). Previous studies on biofuel production systems showed that emissions of N2O may counterbalance a substantial part of the global warming reduction, which is achieved by fossil fuel displacement. In this study, we related measured field emissions of N2O to the reduction in fossil fuel-derived CO2, which was obtained when agricultural biomasses were used for biofuel production. The analysis included five organically managed feedstocks (viz. dried straw of sole cropped rye, sole cropped vetch and intercropped ryevetch, as well as fresh grassclover and whole crop maize) and three scenarios for conversion of biomass into biofuel. The scenarios were (i) bioethanol, (ii) biogas and (iii) coproduction of bioethanol and biogas. In the last scenario, the biomass was first used for bioethanol fermentation and subsequently the effluent from this process was utilized for biogas production. The net GHG reduction was calculated as the avoided fossil fuel-derived CO2, where the N2O emission was subtracted. This value did not account for fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions from farm machinery and during conversion processes that turn biomass into biofuel. The greatest net GHG reduction, corresponding to 700800 g CO2 m(-2), was obtained by biogas production or coproduction of bioethanol and biogas on either fresh grassclover or whole crop maize. In contrast, biofuel production based on lignocellulosic crop residues (i.e. rye and vetch straw) provided considerably lower net GHG reductions (=215 g CO2 m(-2)), and even negative numbers sometimes. No GHG benefit was achieved by fertilizing the maize crop because the extra crop yield, and thereby increased biofuel production, was offset by enhanced N2O emissions.

Nitrous oxide emissions from cropping systems producing biomass for future bio-refineries. A growing bioeconomy demands high, but sustainable production of biomass. In contrast to annual crops, perennial crops may combine high biomass yields with low nitrogen (N) leaching losses despite intensive management. However, there is an important trade-off between N fertilization to increase biomass production and the associated nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions when estimated with the IPCC default emission factor (EF) of 1% of applied N. Actual N2O emissions may vary with crop species and site conditions, and a field experiment was therefore conducted to determine N2O emissions and biomass yields from selected perennial crops. Three perennial crops were established five years prior to this study, including festulolium (x Festulolium braunii) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), both receiving 425 kg N ha(-1) in NPK fertilizer with 60% ammonium-N and 40% nitrate-N, and grass-clover (Lolium perenne-Trifolium pretense) receiving PK fertilizer only. Maize (Zea mays) receiving 140 kg N ha(-1) in NPK was included as a reference annual crop; all treatments had unfertilized subplots. The total biomass yields of fertilized maize (14.3 Mg DM ha(-1)), festulolium (15.3 Mg DM ha(-1)) and tall fescue (16.2 Mg DM ha(-1)) were similar, and higher than grass-clover yield (8.4 Mg DM ha(-1)). There were three cuts in perennial crops, and peak emissions of N2O occurred after cutting and fertilization. Unexpectedly, PK fertilization increased N2O emissions by 89% compared to unfertilized grass-clover. A mixed-effect model examining drivers of N2O emissions after each fertilization indicated that temperature and nitrate were more important for N2O emissions than soil wetness, whether this was expressed as water-filled pore space or relative gas diffusivity, D-p/D-0. The overall highest emissions of N2O, which occurred in festulolium and tall fescue after the 1st cut and 2nd fertilization, coincided with rainfall after a dry period. Measurements of soil respiration indicated that these high N2O emissions were triggered by a release of labile carbon after the rapid wetting, and hence that denitrification of nitrate in the fertilizer applied was a significant source. Fertilization increased N2O emissions two- to three-fold compared to treatments without fertilization, but the annual emission factors for fertilizer N were consistently below the default IPCC emission factor of 1% with 0.23 +/- 0.04, 0.32 +/- 0.03 and 0.54 +/- 0.13% for, respectively, festulolium, tall fescue and maize. Hence, this study suggests that intensively managed perennial crops can be used for biomass production on sandy loam soil without excessive N2O emissions compared to annual crops.

N2O flux dynamics and production pathways modulated by soil organic matter and litter turnover. Addition of organic material, such as plant litter, can strongly alter C and N turnover in soils and promote CO2 and N2O formation. This study aimed to elucidate the role of C availability on N turnover processes leading to N2O formation under moderately dry conditions. We measured CO2, NO, and N2O fluxes and contributing processes from an arable and a grassland soil with four different treatments: 50% water-filled pore space (WFPS), 50% WFPS + Maize litter, 60% WFPS, 60% WFPS + Maize litter. CO2 fluxes were partitioned into SOM- and litter-derived, and N2O-forming processes were esti-mated applying a Bayesian mixing and fractionation model to infer source contributions and N2O reduction rates. Further, we quantified bacterial and fungal population size, as well as genes involved in nitrification and denitrification at the end of the experiment. N2O flux dynamics and contributing processes strongly differed between the C-limited arable soil and the C-rich grassland soil. In the arable soil, bacterial denitrification was consistently the main source of N2O and strongly increased with addition of maize litter. In contrast, nitrification accounted for 51% of N2O formation in the grassland soil without litter, while litter addition promoted fungal denitrification. We found higher N2O emissions with higher total and SOM-derived CO2 emissions confirming that availability of organic C from SOM and litter are important controls of N2O losses. However, neither soil organic C content, nor litter addition, nor soil moisture alone were appropriate to predict the main N2O-forming process. Therefore, our study emphasizes the need to disentangle and quantify N2O-forming processes to develop successful mitigation strategies C1 [Rummel, Pauline Sophie; Englert, Paulina] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Sect Plant Nutr & Crop Physiol, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.

Combining organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilisation reduces N2O emissions from cereal crops: a comparative analysis of China and Zimbabwe. Agriculture is one of the major sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) whose atmospheric concentrations are estimated to increase with efforts to increase food production through increasing nitrogen (N) inputs. The objective of this study was to quantify N2O emissions from maize (Zea mays L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields amended with inorganic, organic N and a combination of both sources (integrated management), in tropical (Zimbabwe) and temperate (China) climatic conditions. In Zimbabwe N2O emissions were measured from maize plots, while in China emissions were measured from maize and winter wheat plots. In Zimbabwe the treatments were; (i) Control, (ii) 60 kg N ha(-1) ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), (iii) 120 kg N ha(-1) NH4NO3, (iv) 60 kg ha(-1) cattle (Bos primigenius) manure-N, plus 60 kg N ha(-1) NH4NO3, (v) 60 kg N ha(-1) cattle manure-N, and (vi) 120 kg N ha(-1) cattle manure-N. In China, treatments were; (i) Control, (ii) 300 kg N ha(-1) Urea, (iii) 92 kg N ha(-1) Urea plus 65 kg ha(-1) chicken (Gallus domesticus) manure-N, (iv) 100 kg N ha(-1) Urea and (v) 100 kg N ha(-1) control release Urea. Our results showed that under both temperate and tropical conditions, integrated nutrient management resulted in lower N2O emissions compared to inorganic fertilizers which had higher total and yield-scale N2O emissions. We conclude that by combining organic and inorganic N sources, smallholder farmers in both China and Zimbabwe, and other countries with similar climatic conditions, can mitigate agricultural emissions without compromising productivity.

Nitrous oxide emissions from cultivated black soil: A case study in Northeast China and global estimates using empirical model. Manure application is effective in promoting soil carbon sequestration, but its impact on N2O emission is not well understood. A field experiment was conducted in a maize-cultivated black soil in Northeast China with six treatments: inorganic fertilizer (NPK), 75% inorganic fertilizer N plus 25% pig (PM1) or chicken (CM1) manure N, 50% inorganic fertilizer N plus 50% pig (PM2) or chicken (CM2) manure N, and no N fertilizer (CK). Annual N2O emission significantly increased from 0.34kgNha(-1) for CK to 0.86kgNha(-1) for NPK and further to 1.65, 1.02, 1.17, and 0.93kgNha(-1) for PM1, CM1, PM2, and CM2, respectively. A N-15 tracing study showed that 71-79% of total N2O was related to nitrification at 30-70% water-filled pore space (WFPS), and heterotrophic nitrification contributed 49% and 25% to total N2O at 30% and 70% WFPS, respectively. In an incubation, N2O emission was only stimulated when nitrate and glucose were applied together at 60% WFPS, indicating that denitrification was carbon limited. PM had a stronger effect on denitrification than CM due to higher decomposability, and the lower N2O emission at higher manure application rate was associated with decreased mineral N supply. After compiling a worldwide database and establishing an empirical model that related N2O emissions (kgNha(-1)) to precipitation (P-r, m) and fertilizer N application rate (N-r, kg N ha(-1)) (N2O = 1.533P(r) + 0.0238P(r)N(r)), annual N2O emission from global-cultivated black soil applied with inorganic fertilizer N was estimated as 347 Gg N. Our results suggested that N2O emission from cultivated black soils in China was low primarily due to low precipitation and labile organic carbon availability, and would be stimulated by manure application; thus, increased N2O emission should be taken into consideration as applying manure increases soil organic carbon sequestration.

The study involved five treatments: organic manure (NPKM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NP (NP), fertilizer NK (NK), and control (CK). Manured soils had higher crop biomass, organic C, and pH than soils receiving the various mineralized fertilizers indicating that long-term application of manures could efficiently prevent red soil acidification and increase crop productivity. The application of manures and fertilizers at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) obviously increased N2O and CO2 emissions from 0.58 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 10 565 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the CK treatment soil to 3.01 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 28 663 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the NPKM treatment. There were also obvious different effects on N2O and CO, emissions between applying fertilizer and manure. More N2O and CO2 released during the 184-d maize growing season than the 125-d wheat growth season in the manure fertilized soils but not in mineral fertilizer treatments. N2O emission was significantly affected by soil moisture only during the wheat growing season, and CO, emission was affected by soil temperature only in CK and NP treatment during the wheat and maize growing season. In sum, this study indicates the application of organic manure may be a preferred strategy for maintaining red soil productivity, but may result in greater N2O and CO2 emissions than treatments only with mineral fertilizer.

Nitrous oxide emissions from China's croplands based on regional and crop-specific emission factors deviate from IPCC 2006 estimates. Calculated N2O emission factors (EFs) of applied nitrogen (N) fertilizer are currently based upon a single, universal value advocated by the IPCC (Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change) even though EFs are thought to vary with climate and soil types. Here, we compiled and analyzed 151 N2O EF values from agricultural fields across China. The EF of synthetic N applied to these croplands was 0.60%, on average, but differed significantly among six climatic zones across the country, with the highest EF found in the north subtropical zone for upland fields (0.93%) and the lowest in the middle subtropical zone for paddy fields (0.20%). Precipitation and soil pH, which showed non-linear relationships with EF, are among the factors governing it, explaining 7.0% and 8.0% of the regional variation in EFs, respectively. Annual precipitation was the key factor regulating N2O emissions from synthetic N fertilizers. Among crop types, legume crops had the highest EFs, which were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those of cereals. Total soil N2O emissions from fertilized croplands with maize, rice, wheat, and vegetables in China, calculated using the climatic zone (regional) EFs, were estimated to be 239 Gg N yr(-1) with an uncertainty of 21%. Importantly, this value was substantially (33%) lower than that (357 Gg N yr(-1)) derived from the IPCC default EF but close to the 253 Gg N yr(-1) estimated using crop-specific EFs. N2O emissions from applied synthetic N fertilizer accounted for 66.5% of the total annual N2O emissions from China's maize, rice, wheat and vegetable fields. Taken together, our study's results strongly suggest that regional EFs should be included for accurate N2O inventories from croplands across China. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nitrous oxide and methane emissions from soil under integrated farming systems in southern Brazil. This study aimed at evaluating soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from integrated farming systems. Soil N2O and CH4 fluxes were assessed in a subtropical Cambisol in southern Brazil, using manual static chambers, over two years, in five farming systems (cropland, livestock, integrated crop-livestock, integrated livestock-forestry, and integrated crop-livestock-forestry). The study was conducted in four growing seasons: summer-1, winter-1, summer-2, winter-2. Integrated farming systems had lower soil N2O emissions than livestock. The observed reduction was possibly due to lower water-filled pore space (WFPS) in soils under integrated systems (average 59.5-64.7%, vs 70.4% in livestock) as indicated by correlation (r = 0.74). Cropland, including cover-crops and maize, also had lower N2O emission (by 40%) relative to livestock, of levels similar to those observed in integrated systems. Methane was consumed in soil, but it was not affected by farming systems, and offset only similar to 1.4% of the N2O emissions. In the rainiest season of summer-2, the soil had the highest WFPS (on average 71.4%) and thus the highest N2O emission (on average 9.79 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1)) and the lowest CH4 consumption (on average - 0.40 kg CH4-C ha(-1) season(-1)); while the opposite trend occurred in the driest season of winter-2 (on average 57.3% WFPS; 0.64 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1) and -0.90 kg CH4-C ha(-1) season(-1)). Integrated farming systems including crop-livestock, livestock-forestry and crop-livestock-forestry reduced soil N2O emissions relative to sole livestock by 27-40%, but did not affect CH4 emissions. Seasonal variations of precipitation, and therefore WFPS were driving factors of the N2O and CH4 emissions. Overall, integrated farming systems show the potential to mitigate soil N2O emission compared to livestock system.

Simulation of Nitrous Oxide Emission and Mineralized Nitrogen under Different Straw Retention Conditions Using a Denitrification-Decomposition Model. Straw retention has been adopted worldwide to increase crop production and it has also been shown to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from agricultural soils. However, it is difficult to accurately predict N2O emission under different straw retention methods without a long-term experiment. This study used data from the maize planting season in the Griffith region, Australia, to test whether the denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model can simulate the rate, annual amount, and pattern of N2O emission. The sensitivity to several important factors which may affect N2O emission was analyzed. The research investigated whether the DNDC model can be used to determine the best straw retention method to reduce N2O emission. The results were as follows: (1) The DNDC model could be used to simulate soil and climate conditions of Griffith region. The correlation coefficients of simulated and observed water-filled pore space and temperature were 0.9532 (n = 126) and 0.9781 (n = 365), respectively; (2) the simulation values of 300N-burn and 300N-incorporate for a year were 12.96 and 8.08 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and the emission factors were 3.31 and 1.77, respectively; (3) the emission reduction effect and mineralized N accumulation of straw incorporation were better compared to burnt straw, using the DNDC model. The correlation coefficients of simulated and observed daily values of 300N-burn and 300N-incorporate were 0.8743 and 0.8023, respectively; (4) the amount and frequency of nitrogen fertilizer application, irrigation frequency, and soil texture could affect N2O emission, whereas soil pH and soil bulk density did not.

The greenhouse gas cost of agricultural intensification with groundwater irrigation in a Midwest US row cropping system. Groundwater irrigation of cropland is expanding worldwide with poorly known implications for climate change. This study compares experimental measurements of the net global warming impact of a rainfed versus a groundwater-irrigated corn (maize)-soybean-wheat, no-till cropping system in the Midwest US, the region that produces the majority of U.S. corn and soybean. Irrigation significantly increased soil organic carbon (C) storage in the upper 25 cm, but not by enough to make up for the CO2-equivalent (CO(2)e) costs of fossil fuel power, soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), and degassing of supersaturated CO2 and N2O from the groundwater. A rainfed reference system had a net mitigating effect of -13.9 (+/- 31) g CO(2)e m(-2) year(-1), but with irrigation at an average rate for the region, the irrigated system contributed to global warming with net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 27.1 (+/- 32) g CO(2)e m(-2) year(-1). Compared to the rainfed system, the irrigated system had 45% more GHG emissions and 7% more C sequestration. The irrigation-associated increase in soil N2O and fossil fuel emissions contributed 18% and 9%, respectively, to the system's total emissions in an average irrigation year. Groundwater degassing of CO2 and N2O are missing components of previous assessments of the GHG cost of groundwater irrigation; together they were 4% of the irrigated system's total emissions. The irrigated system's net impact normalized by crop yield (GHG intensity) was +0.04 (+/- 0.006) kg CO(2)e kg(-1) yield, close to that of the rainfed system, which was -0.03 (+/- 0.002) kg CO(2)e kg(-1) yield. Thus, the increased crop yield resulting from irrigation can ameliorate overall GHG emissions if intensification by irrigation prevents land conversion emissions elsewhere, although the expansion of irrigation risks depletion of local water resources.

Soil nitrogen dynamics in irrigated maize systems as impacted on by nitrogen and stubble management. The soil nitrogen (N) dynamics of an irrigated maize system in which stubble retention and stubble burned treatments were superimposed over treatments of varying N fertiliser rate were studied. The field site was near Whitton, New South Wales, Australia, and the work described here is part a life cycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from maize project. The objective of this part of the work was to quantify the fate of fertiliser N applied at the site. Field measurements of denitrification, mineral N content and recovery of N-15-labelled urea from microplots with and without ammonium thiosulfate were complimented with laboratory studies of denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux. Significantly (P < 0.05) more fertiliser N was recovered in the grain from the stubble incorporated treatment than the stubble burned treatment and there was greater recovery of fertiliser N in the soil at the end of the experiment in the stubble burned treatment. This may indicate that fertiliser N applied to the stubble burned system may be more exposed to soil-N transformations. The reason for the difference in uptake and soil residual is not clear but may be related to soil structure differences leading to less plant accessibility of N in the burned treatment. This difference may lead to more nitrous oxide emission from soil in the stubble burned treatments. Short-term (1 h) static chamber measurements in the field found a strong N-rate dependence of N2O emission rate for fertiliser rates between 0 and 300 kg N/ha. Inclusion of ammonium thiosulfate in the fertiliser formulation did not appear to have a significant impact on fertiliser N recovery. C1 [Edis, R. B.; Chen, D.; Wang, G.; Turner, D.

Nitrogen fertilization but not soil tillage affects nitrous oxide emissions from a clay loam soil under a maize-soybean rotation. Conversion of agricultural systems from conventional to no tillage practices usually increases soil carbon storage. However, adoption of no tillage may increase emissions of N2O, a very potent greenhouse gas. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of tillage (mouldboard plough [MP] and no-tillage [NT]) and three mineral N application rates (0,80 and 160 kg N ha(-1)) on annual and biennial (2004-2005) N2O fluxes. The experiment was organized using a split-plot design using tillage as the main plots and fertilizer rates as the sub-plot. The site was an artificially drained and therefore well structured humic gleysol near Montreal QC, on a maize (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation. Emissions (April-November) ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Throughout both years tillage had no effect (P > 0.05) on N2O emissions. During 2004, under maize cultivation, N2O emissions increased with the N fertilization rate (P < 0.001). Between 0.9 and 1.3% of applied fertilizer N was lost as N2O-N, similar to the IPCC estimate of 1%. There was also no significant interaction between tillage and N fertilization rate on N2O emissions during either year (P = 0.79). During the second year, under soybean cultivation, no N fertilizer was applied. As N2O emissions from the different fertilizer treatments were similar (P = 0.99), we concluded that there was no carry-over effect of the fertilization applied to maize in the previous year. Yield-based N2O emissions were similar between the different tillage types (P = 0.63 and 0.12 for 2004 and 2005, respectively) and fertilization rates (P = 0.30 and 0.84 for 2004 and 2005, respectively) and ranged from 17.0 to 22.7 g N2O-N kg(-1) N export in 2004 and 6.6 to 12.8 g N2O-N kg(-1) N export in 2005. Overall our results indicate that for this well-drained soil: (i) N fertilizer applications increased N2O emissions, supporting the use of IPCC-type emission factors; and (ii) soil tillage and the tillage-fertilization interaction had no measurable effect, consistent with previous reports that tillage of well-aerated agricultural soils has little effect on N2O emissions.

Greenhouse gas emissions associated to sprinkler-irrigated alfalfa under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions. Aim of the study: Alfalfa is one the most important forage legume crop worldwide but little information is available regarding to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) under Mediterranean sprinkler-irrigated conditions. Area of study: Middle Ebro valley, Spain Materials and methods: The GHG emissions during two alfalfa growing periods (4th and 5th stands) were evaluated using both the static method chambers and two automatic chambers coupled with a photoacoustic equipment that measured short-term gas emissions. Main results: Year-average CH4 fluxes were -0.71 g C ha(-1) day(-1), generally no significantly different from zero. Year-average N2O flux was 3.96 g N ha(-1) day(-1) with higher fluxes associated to some specific large rainfall or irrigation events. Average cumulative emissions of 865 g N ha(-1) year(-1) were found. We found short-term peaks of N2O (up to 160 g N ha(-1) day(-1)) associated with high values of soil water filled pore space (WFPS) that can go unnoticed using the static chamber procedure. In spite of the higher soil NO3- concentration in the alfalfa-precedent field compared to the maize-precedent field, no significant differences in cumulative N2O emissions were observed in the two-month period after alfalfa or maize residues incorporation. Research highlights: Low GHG emissions were found in an irrigated alfalfa crop compared to N-fertilized crops but a deeper knowledge of the limiting factors of denitrification observed during some anoxic events (WFPS>90%) is necessary to properly quantify N2O emissions in irrigated alfalfa.

Nitrous oxide emissions and N-cycling gene abundances in a drip-fertigated (surface versus subsurface) maize crop with different N sources. Surface drip fertigation has demonstrated promising results regarding the mitigation of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The use of subsurface irrigation may offer the possibility of reducing these emissions further due to the modification of the soil moisture profile and N allocation, both of which affect the biochemical processes leading to N2O fluxes. However, the mitigation potential of subsurface irrigation combined with different mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizers (ammonium or nitrate-based, use of nitrification inhibitors) still needs to be evaluated. To respond to this need, a 2-year field experiment was set up in central Spain to test two different drip-fertigation systems (surface and subsurface at 30 cm depth) and four N fertilization treatments (control, calcium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate with or without the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate, DMPP) in an irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) crop. Nitrous oxide emissions, mineral N concentrations (ammonium, NH4+, and nitrate, NO3-), and abundance of key N genes involved in nitrification and denitrification processes were measured in two soil layers (0-20 and 20-40 cm). Regardless of the irrigation system, ammonium sulfate gave the highest cumulative N2O losses in both campaigns, while calcium nitrate and the use of DMPP were the most effective strategies to abate N2O fluxes in the first and second years, respectively. Differences between irrigation systems were not statistically significant for cumulative N2O emissions, despite the clear effect on topsoil mineral N (higher NH4+ and NO3- concentrations in surface and subsurface drip, respectively). Nitrous oxide emissions were positively correlated with soil NH4+ concentrations. Gene abundances were not a trustworthy predictor of N2O losses in the 1st year, although a clear inhibitory effect of fertilization on microbial communities (i.e., ammonia oxidizers, nitrite reducers, and N2O reducers) was observed during this campaign. During the second year, nitrifying and denitrifying genes were affected by irrigation (with higher abundances in the 20-40 cm layer in subsurface than in surface drip) and by the addition of DMPP (which had a detrimental effect on gene abundances in both irrigation systems that disappeared after the fertigation period). In conclusion, the use of DMPP or calcium nitrate instead of ammonium sulfate may enhance the chances for an additional mitigation in both surface and subsurface irrigation systems.

Nitrous oxide emissions from grain production systems across a wide range of environmental conditions in eastern Australia. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from Australian grain cropping systems are highly variable due to the large variations in soil and climate conditions and management practices under which crops are grown. Agricultural soils contribute 55% of national N2O emissions, and therefore mitigation of these emissions is important. In the present study, we explored N2O emissions, yield and emissions intensity in a range of management practices in grain crops across eastern Australia with the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). The model was initially evaluated against experiments conducted at six field sites across major grain-growing regions in eastern Australia. Measured yields for all crops used in the experiments (wheat, barley, sorghum, maize, cotton, canola and chickpea) and seasonal N2O emissions were satisfactorily predicted with R-2 = 0.93 and R-2 = 0.91 respectively. As expected, N2O emissions and emissions intensity increased with increasing nitrogen (N) fertiliser input, whereas crop yields increased until a yield plateau was reached at a site-and crop-specific N rate. The mitigation potential of splitting N fertiliser application depended on the climate conditions and was found to be relevant only in the southern grain-growing region, where most rainfall occurs during the cropping season. Growing grain legumes in rotation with cereal crops has great potential to reduce mineral N fertiliser requirements and so N2O emissions. In general, N management strategies that maximise yields and increase N use efficiency showed the greatest promise for N2O mitigation.

Nitrous oxide emissions during the non-rice growing seasons of two subtropical rice-based rotation systems in southwest China. High nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions may occur during the non-rice growing season of Chinese rice-upland crop rotation systems. However, our understanding of N2O emission during this season is poor due to a scarcity of available field N2O measurements. Using the static manual chamber-GC technique, seasonal N2O emissions during the non-rice growing season were simultaneously measured at two adjacent rice-wheat and rice-rapeseed fields in southwest China for three consecutive annual rotation cycles (May 2005 to May 2008). Compared to the control, N fertilizer applications significantly enhanced soil N2O emissions from both wheat and rapeseed systems. Seasonal cumulative N2O fluxes from wheat systems were on average 2.6 kg N ha(-1) for the recommended practice (RP [150 kg N ha(-1)]) and 5.0 kg N ha(-1) for the conventional practice (CP [250 kg N ha(-1)]). Lower N2O emissions were observed from the adjacent rapeseed systems. Average cumulative seasonal N2O fluxes from rapeseed were 1.5 and 2.2 kg N ha(-1) for the RP and CP treatments, respectively. The first 3 weeks after N fertilization were the \"hot moment\" of N2O emissions for both the wheat and rapeseed systems. The lowest yield-scaled N2O fluxes for wheat were obtained at the RP treatment (mean: 0.81 kg N Mg-1) while for rapeseed the CP treatment produced the lowest yield-scaled fluxes (mean: 0.79 kg N Mg-1). On average, the direct N2O emission factors (EFd) for the wheat system (1.76 %) were over two times higher than for the rapeseed system (0.73 %). Intercropping of rapeseed tends to result in lower N2O emissions than wheat for rice-upland crop rotation systems of southwest China, indicating that either the N fertilization or the cropping system need to be considered not only for improving the estimate of regional and/or national N2O fluxes but also for proposing the climate-smart agricultural management practice to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils.

Soil N2O emissions following cover-crop residues application under two soil moisture conditions. Cover crops in rotation or intercropped with annual crops are important strategies to increase C and N input in agricultural soils. However, these practices may also enhance soil N2O emissions. The effect on N2O emissions may be dependent upon the biochemical composition of cover crop residues. A 47-d incubation study was conducted to determine soil N2O emissions following the addition of residues from three summer legume species [pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.), lablab bean (Lablab purpureus)], one winter legume [vetch (Vicia sativa L.)], one winter monocotyledon [black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.)], and maize (Zea mays L.) under two water-filled pore space levels (40 and 70% WFPS). Short-term peaks of N2O fluxes were observed after the addition of all crop residues, but were much greater under 70 than 40% WFPS (5.2 and 5133 mu g N-N2O kg(-1) soil for 40 and 70% WFPS, respectively). Under both WFPS, significantly higher peaks were detected after the application of N-rich legume residues (7.7 and 3,356 mu g N-N2O kg(-1) soil under 40 and 70% WFPS, respectively) than after the application of grass residues (2.8 and 1,777 mu g N-N2O kg(-1) soil under 40 and 70% WFPS, respectively). Cumulative soil N2O produced under 70% WFPS was approx. 110 times greater than under 40% WFPS. Soil N2O emissions increased linearly as residue N content increased. Soil N2O emissions also increased linearly as the content of the recalcitrant compounds lignin and polyphenols increased, because residues with high N content also had high lignin and polyphenols content. When the content of C and recalcitrant compounds were expressed on an N basis, soil N2O emission decreased linearly as residue C/N, lignin/N, polyphenol/N, and (lignin + polyphenols)/N ratios increased. Indices that include recalcitrant compounds on N basis may beuseful for the selection of cover-crop species withthe least impact on soil N2O emissions. However, our results show that these ratio indices had similar correlation coefficients compared to C/N ratio, indicating that C/N ratio is an efficient index to predict soil N2O emission following cover crop application.

The impact of fertilization on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and comammox Nitrospira communities and the subsequent effect on N2O emission and maize yield in a semi-arid region. The control of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions through nitrification and the optimization of maize yield are important in agricultural systems. However, within the semi-arid region, the impact of fertilization on the function of nitrification communities and its connection with N2O emissions in the rhizosphere soil is still unclear. Our study investigates the influence of fertilization treatments on the communities of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and the complete ammonia oxidizers of the Nitrospira known as comammox (CAOB) in a maize agroecosystem. Nitrous oxide production, potential nitrification activity (PNA), maize yield, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were determined for the same samples. The fertilizer treatments included a control group without fertilization (NA), inorganic fertilizer (CF), organic fertilizer (SM), combined inorganic and organic fertilizer (SC), and maize straw (MS). The SC treatment indicated a lower cumulative N2O emission than the CF treatment in the 2020 and 2021 cropping seasons. The AOB community under the CF, MS, and SM treatments was predominantly composed of Nitrosospira cluster 3b, while the SC treatment was associated with the comammox Nitrospira clade A.1 lineage, related to key species such as Ca. Nitrospira inopinata and Ca. Nitrospira nitrificans. Network analysis demonstrated a positive potential for competitive interaction between hub taxonomy and distinct keystone taxa among AOB and comammox Nitrospira nitrifiers. The structural equation model further revealed a significant positive association between AOB nitrifiers and N2O emission, PNA, soil pH, SOC, NO3--N, and DON under organic fertilization. The keystone taxa in the comammox Nitrospira nitrifier and network Module II exhibited a positive correlation with maize productivity and NUE, likely due to their functional activities stimulated by the SC treatment. It is noteworthy that the AOB community played a more significant role in driving nitrification compared to the composition of comammox Nitrospira. Collectively, combined inorganic and organic fertilizer (SC) treatment exhibits high potential for reducing N2O emissions, enhancing maize productivity, increasing NUE, and increasing the sustainability of the nitrogen dynamics of maize agroecosystems in the semi-arid Loess Plateau.

What is the most relevant soil structure parameter to describe field-measured N2O emissions?. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil are partly controlled by aeration and gas transfer in soil, and thus by soil structure. The intensity of N2O emissions is usually expressed according to the water filled pore space (WFPS), calculated using the soil bulk density. These factors, even if they describe the soil structure and the water proportion in the porous network, do not inform about porous network characteristics among scales and their connectivity. The aim of this work was therefore to determine (1) to what extent the soil structure of an agricultural soil controlled N2O emissions during a snap-shot campaign and (2) which metric of gas transfer or soil structure was the most appropriate to describe the N2O emission variability at field scale. N2O emissions were measured with a mobile chamber on a maize crop after fertilization with several soil management practices resulting in four soil states (strip-till versus tillage, compacted soil versus uncompacted) with contrasting soil structure. Soil cylinders and bulk soil were sampled from 24 plots exhibiting a strong gradient in N2O emissions. Classical soil physical and chemical properties were measured, including soil bulk density and water filled pore space. Soil structure also was characterized quantitatively by X-ray tomography at meso and macro scales, and indirectly by gas transfer parameters. Clear differences were observed between low and high emission plots in terms of soil structure, soil temperature and nitrate concentration. However, soil structure appeared more strongly connected to N2O emissions, and some thresholds on soil structural indicators were relevant to disentangle high and low N2O fluxes. Some structural indicators at both scales (e.g. porosity, surface density) and gas transfer parameters (relative gas diffusivity, air permeability) were good descriptors of the observed N2O fluxes. Nevertheless, the gas transfer parameters can be easily measured over a short period of time, whereas the soil structure indicators determined from 3D images require an acquisition and a processing phase that can be time consuming. A good compromise to evaluate the field N2O flux potential from an easy measure would be to evaluate the relative gas diffusivity, which directly controls the diffusion of oxygen in soil and thereby the microbial processes of N2O production.

Contribution of the postharvest period to soil N2O emissions from arable Mediterranean crops. Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are a relevant contributor to the global warming potential of Mediterranean agro-ecosystems and therefore should be accurately quantified. Here, we investigated the quantitative relevance of considering postharvest N2O measurements when calculating annual soil N2O emissions from herbaceous crops (excluding rice). Data from 25 studies conducted in Mediterranean climates were compiled from a variety of crops and cropping systems, soil types, tillage practices, and nitrogen (N) fertilizer management practices. The differences between cumulative N2O emissions in the cropping period (preharvest emissions) and in the postharvest period were evaluated through a meta-analysis, as were the maximum N2O peaks in both periods and the resultant N2O emission factors (EFs). The relative contribution of the postharvest period to total cumulative N2O emissions was a mean 26%, but showed high variability. The average N2O EFs in the field experiments included in this study were 0.21% and 0.27% when not considering and when considering the postharvest period, respectively. The relative and absolute contribution of postharvest emissions was significantly greater for winter cereals than for either horticultural crops or maize. The maximum preharvest fluxes were higher than the maximum postharvest fluxes in 72% of the observations, but notable postharvest N2O peaks after soil rewetting were obtained in some studies. On average, postharvest emissions in nonfertilized plots were similar to those in fertilized winter crops. Other factors such as N source (greater relevance for organic fertilizers, particularly in summer crops), N rate, tillage intensity and soil texture significantly affected the amount of postharvest emissions. Taking measurements during the postharvest period in Mediterranean cropping systems are encouraged in studies that include winter crops, use of organic fertilizers or have unbalanced N rates. Our results may contribute to improving N2O measurement protocols and to re-evaluating N2O EFs in Mediterranean and semiarid areas.

Non-native Brachiaria humidicola with biological nitrification inhibition capacity stimulates in situ grassland N2O emissions. IntroductionBrachiaria humidicola, a tropical grass, could release root exudates with biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) capacity and reduce soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from grasslands. However, evidence of the reduction effect in situ in tropical grasslands in China is lacking. MethodsTo evaluate the potential effects of B. humidicola on soil N2O emissions, a 2-year (2015-2017) field experiment was established in a Latosol and included eight treatments, consisting of two pastures, non-native B. humidicola and a native grass, Eremochloa ophiuroide, with four nitrogen (N) application rates. The annual urea application rates were 0, 150, 300, and 450 kg N ha(-1). ResultsThe average 2-year E. ophiuroides biomass with and without N fertilization were 9.07-11.45 and 7.34 t ha(-1), respectively, and corresponding values for B. humidicola increased to 31.97-39.07 and 29.54 t ha(-1), respectively. The N-use efficiencies under E. ophiuroide and B. humidicola cultivation were 9.3-12.0 and 35.5-39.4%, respectively. Annual N2O emissions in the E. ophiuroides and B. humidicola fields were 1.37 and 2.83 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively, under no N fertilization, and 1.54-3.46 and 4.30-7.19 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively, under N fertilization. DiscussionsAccording to the results, B. humidicola cultivation increased soil N2O emissions, especially under N fertilization. This is because B. humidicola exhibited the more effective stimulation effect on N2O production via denitrification primarily due to increased soil organic carbon and exudates than the inhibition effect on N2O production via autotrophic nitrification. Annual yield-scaled N2O emissions in the B. humidicola treatment were 93.02-183.12 mg N2O-N kg(-1) biomass, which were significantly lower than those in the E. ophiuroides treatment. Overall, our results suggest that cultivation of the non-native grass, B. humidicola with BNI capacity, increased soil N2O emissions, while decreasing yield-scaled N2O emissions, when compared with native grass cultivation.

Successive straw biochar amendments reduce nitrous oxide emissions but do not improve the net ecosystem economic benefit in an alkaline sandy loam under a wheat-maize cropping system. Crop straw is converted to biochar with subsequent applications to soils as a multi-benefit strategy for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation, carbon sequestration, and straw disposal and utilization in intensive agriculture. However, tradeoffs between agronomic, economic, and environmental performance of long-term agricultural biochar use remain unclear. Using a case study of biochar-amended alkaline sandy loamy soil, we investigated the effects of field application of straw biochar at 0, 2.25, 6.75, and 11.25 Mg ha(-1) to 10 successive wheat and maize crop seasons over five rotation years on crop yield, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, soil total organic carbon (TOC), and soil carbon pool (SCP). The net global warming potential (net GWP) and net ecosystem economic benefit (NEEB) were assessed to examine the tension between balancing economic returns and environmental benefits. Results indicated that biochar treatments slightly increased total crop grain yields and greatly reduced the total N2O emissions over five rotation years. The soil total organic carbon content was enhanced while the CO2 emissions during biochar production almost offset the increase in the soil carbon pool. Economic assessment showed that the net ecosystem economic benefit was lowered with enhanced costs of the increasing biochar use under the current low C trade market. These results highlight the promotion of the use of straw biochar in successive applications as a strategy to effectively offset greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture requires optimization of the straw pyrolysis system to reduce the energy consumption and overall biochar costs, and price enhancement of C trade.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission characteristics of farmland (rice, wheat, and maize) based on different fertilization strategies. Fertilizer application is the basis for ensuring high yield, high quality and high efficiency of farmland. In order to meet the demand for food with the increasing of population, the application of nitrogen fertilizer will be further increased, which will lead to problems such as N2O emission and nitrogen loss from farmland, it will easily deteriorate the soil and water environment of farmland, and will not conducive to the sustainable development of modern agriculture. However, optimizing fertilizer management is an important way to solve this problem. While, due to the differences in the study conditions (geographical location, environmental conditions, experimental design, etc.), leading to the results obtained in the literatures about the N2O emission with different nitrogen fertilizer application strategies have significant differences, which requiring further comprehensive quantitative analysis. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of nitrogen fertilizer application strategies (different fertilizer types and fertilizer application rates) on N2O emissions from the fields (rice, wheat and maize) based on the Meta-analysis using 67 published studies (including 1289 comparisons). For the three crops, inorganic fertilizer application significantly increased on-farm N2O emissions by 19.7-101.05% for all three; and organic fertilizer increased N2O emissions by 28.16% and 69.44% in wheat and maize fields, respectively, but the application of organic fertilizer in rice field significantly reduced N2O emissions by 58.1%. The results showed that overall, the application of inorganic fertilizers resulted in higher N2O emissions from farmland compared to the application of organic fertilizers. In addition, in this study, the average annual temperature, annual precipitation, soil type, pH, soil total nitrogen content, soil organic carbon content, and soil bulk weight were used as the main influencing factors of N2O emission under nitrogen fertilizer strategies, and the results of the study can provide a reference for the development of integrated management measures to control greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soils.

An Evaluation of Methods for Identifying Hot Moments of Nitrous Oxide Emissions From Soils. Effectively quantifying hot moments of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils is critical for managing this potent greenhouse gas. However, we are challenged by a lack of standard approaches for identifying hot moments, including (a) determining thresholds above which emissions are considered hot moments, and (b) considering seasonal variation in the magnitude and frequency distribution of net N2O fluxes. We used one year of hourly N2O flux measurements from 16 autochambers that varied in flux magnitude and frequency distribution in a conventionally tilled maize field in central Illinois, USA, to compare three approaches to identify hot moment thresholds: standard deviations (SD) above the mean, 1.5x the interquartile range (IQR), and isolation forest (IF) identification of anomalous values. We also compared these approaches on seasonally subdivided data (early, late, and non-growing seasons) versus the whole year. Our analyses revealed that 1.5x IQR method best identified N2O hot moments. In contrast, using 2 or 4 SD both yielded hot moment threshold values too high, and IF yielded threshold values too low, leading to missed N2O hot moments or low net N2O fluxes mischaracterized as hot moments, respectively. Furthermore, seasonally subdividing the data set not only facilitated identification of smaller hot moments in the late- and non-growing seasons when N2O hot moments were generally smaller but it also increased hot moment threshold values in the early growing season when N2O hot moments were larger. Consequently, of the methods evaluated here, we recommend using the 1.5x IQR method on whole year data sets to identify N2O hot moments.

Nitrous oxide production and potential denitrification in soils from riparian buffer strips: Influence of earthworms and plant litter. Vegetated riparian buffer strips have been established in Southern Quebec (Canada) in order to intercept nutrients such as nitrate (NO3-) and protect water quality near agricultural fields. Buffer strips may also favour denitrification through a combination of high soil moisture, NO3- and carbon supply, which could lead to the production of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas. Denitrification could be further amplified by the presence of earthworms, or by plant species that promote earthworm and bacterial activity in soils. Soils from four farms, comprising maize fields and adjacent buffer strips, were sampled in the fall of 2008. A total of six earthworm species were found, but average earthworm biomass did not differ between buffer strips and maize agroecoecosystems. Nitrate concentrations and net nitrification rates were higher in the maize fields than in the buffer strips: there was no difference in N2O production in soils collected from the two sampling locations. Potential denitrification, measured by acetylene inhibition, varied by two orders of magnitude, depending on experimental conditions: when amended with H2O or with H2O + NO3-, potential denitrification was higher (P < 0.05) in soils from buffer strips than from maize fields. Potential denitrification was highest in soils amended with H2O+glucose, or with H2O+ NO3- + glucose. Using microcosms, we tested the effect of litter-soil mixtures on earthworm growth, and the effect of earthworm-litter-soil mixtures on potential denitrification. Based on four categories of chemical assays, litters of woody species (oak, apple, Rhododendron) were generally of lower nutritional quality than litter from agronomic species (alfalfa, switchgrass, corn stover). Alfalfa litter had the most positive effect, whereas apple litter had the most negative effect, on earthworm growth. Potential denitrification was 2-4 times higher in earthworm-litter-soil mixtures than in plain soil. Litter treatments that included corn stover had lower potential denitrification than those that included alfalfa or switchgrass, whereas litter treatments that included oak had lower potential denitrification than those that included apple or Rhododendron. Results suggest that potential N2O emissions may be higher in riparian buffer strips than in adjacent maize fields, that N2O emissions in buffer strips may be amplified by comminuting earthworms, and that plant litters that reduce earthworm growth may not be best at mitigating N2O emissions.

N2O Emissions From Two Agroecosystems: High Spatial Variability and Long Pulses Observed Using Static Chambers and the Flux-Gradient Technique. With the addition of nitrogen (N), agricultural soils are the main anthropogenic source of N2O, but high spatial and temporal variabilities make N2O emissions difficult to characterize at the field scale. This study used flux-gradient measurements to continuously monitor N2O emissions at two agricultural fields under different management regimes in the inland Pacific Northwest of Washington State, USA. Automated 16-chamber arrays were also deployed at each site; chamber monitoring results aided the interpretation of the flux gradient results. The cumulative emissions over the six-month (1 April-30 September) monitoring period were 2.4 +/- 0.7 and 2.1 +/- 2 kg N2O-N/ha at the no-till and conventional till sites, respectively. At both sites, maximum N2O emissions occurred following the first rainfall event after N fertilization, and both sites had monthlong emission pulses. The no-till site had a larger N2O emission factor than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 emission factor of 1% of the N input, while the conventional-till site's emission factor was close to 1% of the N input. However, these emission factors are likely conservative. We estimate that the global warming potential of the N2O emissions at these sites is larger than that of the no-till conversion carbon uptake. We recommend the use of chambers to investigate spatiotemporal controls as a complementary method to micrometeorological monitoring, especially in systems with high variability. Continued monitoring coupled with the use of models is necessary to investigate how changing management and environmental conditions will affect N2O emissions. Plain Language Summary Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas and stratospheric ozone depleting substance that is emitted by soils. Agricultural soils tend to emit more N2O than natural soils due to the addition of nitrogen fertilizers. N2O emissions are not well understood on the scale of individual farms, as emissions are difficult to measure at this resolution because they are irregular over time and space. This variability is due to the dependence of N2O production and emission on soil properties, that is, moisture, nitrogen, and the microbiome. In this study we monitored N2O emissions from two agricultural fields under different tillage regimes using two complementary methods: the flux-gradient technique and automated chambers. The flux-gradient technique measures N2O emissions at the field scale, which is relevant to agronomic management. Using both techniques together improves confidence in our results, which give us information on total N2O emissions from these fields, as well as the relationships between N2O emissions and rainfall, temperature, and carbon dioxide respiration.

Higher Available Soil Water Storage at Sowing and Frequency of Rainfall Events During the First Month Enhanced the Inhibitory Effect of Nitrification Inhibitor on Nitrous Oxide Emissions. PurposeUrea combined with nitrification inhibitors (NI) can significantly reduce nitrous oxide emissions (N2O) compared to urea. However, there is a lack of evidence for higher agronomic benefits and better environmental benefits, i.e., the ability to minimize N2O emissions and improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) while maintaining high yield under N application rates lower than conventional N application rates.MethodsA 3-year in situ fertilization experiment was conducted under film mulching conditions in the Loess Plateau region with low rainfall. Three treatments of conventional N fertilization (CK), reduced N fertilization (RN), and RN with NI (RN + NI) were used to quantify soil N2O emissions, plant N uptake, NUE, and grain yield.ResultsRN and RN + NI treatments significantly reduced N2O emissions by 17.29-29.15% and 56.00-60.51%, respectively, and significantly increased NUE by 10.79-21.27% and 17.11-25.70%, respectively, compared with CK treatment. However, there was no significant difference in average plant N uptake (178.96-191.37 kg N ha-1) and grain yield (7.84-8.14 t ha-1) among CK, RN, and RN + NI treatments. Furthermore, higher available soil water storage at sowing and large rainfall events during the first month after fertilization would enhance the effect of NI on inhibiting N2O emissions, since the efficiency of NI in reducing N2O emissions depends on the level of water-filled pore space.ConclusionsTherefore, reducing N application combined with NI can be used as an effective N fertilizer management measure, which is helpful to achieve agriculture sustainable development in areas similar to the climate model of the Loess Plateau.

In silico assessment of the potential of basalt amendments to reduce N2O emissions from bioenergy crops. The potential of large-scale deployment of basalt to reduce N2O emissions from cultivated soils may contribute to climate stabilization beyond the CO2-removal effect from enhanced weathering. We used 3 years of field observations from maize (Zea mays) and miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) to improve the nitrogen (N) module of the DayCent model and evaluate the potential of basalt amendments to reduce N losses and increase yields from two bioenergy crops. We found 20%-60% improvement in our N2O flux estimates over previous model descriptions. Model results predict that the application of basalt would reduce N2O emissions by 16% in maize and 9% in miscanthus. Lower N2O emissions responded to increases in the N-2:N2O ratio of denitrification with basalt-induced increases in soil pH, with minor contributions from the impact of P additions (a minor component of some basalts) on N immobilization. The larger reduction of N2O emissions in maize than in miscanthus was likely explained by a synergistic effect between soil pH and N content, leading to a higher sensitivity of the N-2:N2O ratio to changes in pH in heavily fertilized maize. Basalt amendments led to modest increases in modeled yields and the nitrogen use efficiency (i.e., fertilizer-N recover in crop production) of maize but did not affect the productivity of miscanthus. However, enhanced soil P availability maintained the long-term productivity of crops with high nutrient requirements. The alleviation of plant P limitation led to enhanced plant N uptake, thereby contributing to lower microbial N availability and N2O emissions from crops with high nutrient requirements. Our results from the improved model suggest that the large-scale deployment of basalt, by reducing N2O fluxes of cropping systems, could contribute to the sustainable intensification of agriculture and enhance the climate mitigation potential of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage strategies.

Nitrous oxide emission, global warming potential, and denitrifier abundances as affected by long-term fertilization on Mollisols of Northeastern China. A long-term field experiment was performed to assess the effects of fertilization regimes on greenhouse gas emissions, soil properties, soil denitrifies, and maize (Zea mays) grain yield on Mollisols of Northeastern China. Chemical nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers plus pig manure (MNPK) treatment significantly increased soil N2O emissions by 29.9-226.4% and global warming potential (GWP) by 29.8-230.7% compared to unfertilized control (CK), chemical N fertilizer only (N), chemical N, P, and K fertilizers (NPK) and chemical N, P, and K fertilizers plus corn straw (SNPK) treatments. However, the MNPK treatment yielded similar greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) as compared with other treatments, mainly due to higher maize grain yield. There were also higher gene copy numbers of nirK, nirS, and nosZ in topsoil (0-20 cm depth) under MNPK treatment. Automatic linear modeling analysis indicated that main factors influencing soil N2O emissions were soil organic carbon (SOC), NO3- content, and nirK gene abundance. Although the application of chemical fertilizers plus organic manure increases N2O emissions due to higher N and C availability and nirK gene activity in the soil, this is still a promising fertilizer management due to its notable enhancement of maize grain yield and SOC content.

Nitrate uptake and carbon exudation - do plant roots stimulate or inhibit denitrification?. Background and aims Plant growth affects soil moisture, mineral N and organic C availability in soil, all of which influence denitrification. With increasing plant growth, root exudation may stimulate denitrification, while N uptake restricts nitrate availability. Methods We conducted a double labeling pot experiment with either maize (Zea mays L.) or cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) of the same age but differing in size of their shoot and root systems. The N-15 gas flux method was applied to directly quantify N2O and N-2 fluxes in situ. To link denitrification with available C in the rhizosphere, (CO2)-C-13 pulse labeling was used to trace C translocation from shoots to roots and its release by roots into the soil. Results Plant water and N uptake were the main factors controlling daily N2O + N-2 fluxes, cumulative N emissions, and N2O production pathways. Accordingly, pool-derived N2O + N-2 emissions were 30-40 times higher in the treatment with highest soil NO3- content and highest soil moisture. CO2 efflux from soil was positively correlated with root dry matter, but we could not detect any relationship between root-derived C and N2O + N-2 emissions. Conclusions Root-derived C may stimulate denitrification under small plants, while N and water uptake become the controlling factors with increasing plant and root growth.

UNDER FERTILISER APPLICATION AND ELEVATED CARBON DIOXIDE IN NORTHWEST INDIA. A field experiment was carried out at the farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi to quantify the effect of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and different levels of N fertiliser application on nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from soil under maize. The experiment included five treatments: 60 kg N ha(-1) under ambient CO2 (385 ppm) in open plots, 120 kg N ha(-1) under ambient CO2 (385 ppm) in open plots, 160 kg N ha(-1) under ambient CO2 (385 ppm) in open plots, 120 kg N ha(-1) under ambient CO2 (385 ppm) in open top chambers (OTC) and 120 kg N ha(-1) under elevated CO2 (500 +/- 50 ppm) in the OTC. Peaks of N2O flux were observed after every dose of N application. Cumulative N2O emission was 13% lower under ambient CO2 as compared to the elevated CO2 concentrations. There was an increase in CO2 emissions with application of N from 60 kg ha(-1) to 160 kg ha(-1). Higher yield and root biomass was observed under higher N treatment (160 kg N ha(-1)). There was no significant increase in maize yield under elevated CO2 as compared to ambient CO2. The carbon emitted was more than the carbon fixed under elevated CO2 as compared to ambient CO2 levels. The carbon efficiency ratio (C fixed/C emitted) was highest in ambient CO2 treatment in the OTC. C1 [Daripa, A.; Bhatia, A.; Tomer, R.; Singh, S.

Impact of soil amendments on nitrous oxide emissions and the associated denitrifying communities in a semi-arid environment. Denitrifying bacteria produce and utilize nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. However, there is little information on how organic fertilization treatments affect the denitrifying communities and N2O emissions in the semi-arid Loess Plateau. Here, we evaluated how the denitrifying communities are responsible for potential denitrification activity (PDA) and N2O emissions. A field experiment was conducted with five fertilization treatments, including no fertilization (CK), mineral fertilizer (MF), mineral fertilizer plus commercial organic fertilizer (MOF), commercial organic fertilizer (OFP), and maize straw (MSP). Our result showed that soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were significantly increased under MSP treatment compared to MF treatment, while nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) followed the opposite trend. Organic fertilization treatments (MOF, OFP, and MSP treatments) significantly increased the abundance and diversity of nirS- and nosZ-harboring denitrifiers, and modified the community structure compared to CK treatment. The identified potential keystone taxa within the denitrifying bacterial networks belonged to the distinct genera. Denitrification potentials were significantly positively correlated with the abundance of nirS-harboring denitrifiers, rather than that of nirK- and nosZ-harboring denitrifiers. Random forest modeling and structural equation modeling consistently determined that the abundance, community composition, and network module I of nirS-harboring denitrifiers may contribute significantly to PDA and N2O emissions. Collectively, our findings highlight the ecological importance of the denitrifying communities in mediating denitrification potentials and the stimulatory impact of organic fertilization treatments on nitrogen dynamics in the semi-arid Loess Plateau.

Soil CO2 and N2O Emissions in Maize Growing Season Under Different Fertilizer Regimes in an Upland Red Soil Region of South China. Upland red soils have been identified as major CO2 and N2O sources induced by human activities such as fertilization. To monitor characteristics of soil surface CO2 and N2O fluxes in cropland ecosystems after continuous fertilizer applications over decades and to separate the respective contributions of root and heterotrophic respiration to the total soil CO2 and N2O fluxes, the measurements of soil surface CO2 and N2O fluxes throughout the maize growing season in 2009 were carried out based on a fertilization experiment (from 1990) through of the maize (Zea mays L.) growing season in red soil in southern China. Five fertilization treatments were chosen from the experiment for study: zero-fertilizer application (CK), nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizer application only, pig manure (M), NPK plus pig manure (NPKM) and NPK with straw (NPKS). Six chambers were installed in each plot. Three of them are in the inter-row soil (NR) and the others are in the soil within the row (R). Each fertilizer treatment received the same amount of N (300 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Results showed that cumulative soil CO2 fluxes in NR or R were both following the order: NPKS>M, NPKM>NPK>CK. The contributions of root respiration to soil CO2 fluxes was 40, 44, 50, 47 and 35% in CK, NPK, NPKM, M and NPKS treatments, respectively, with the mean value of 43%. Cumulative soil N2O fluxes in NR or R were both following the order: NPKS, NPKM>M>NPK>CK, and soil N2O fluxes in R were 18, 20 and 30% higher than that in NR in NPKM, M and NPKS treatments, respectively, but with no difference between NR and R in NPK treatment. Furthermore, combine with soil temperature at -5 cm depth and soil moisture (0-20 cm) together could explain 55-70% and 42-59% of soil CO2 and N2O emissions with root interference and 62-78% and 44-63% of that without root interference, respectively. In addition, soil CO2 and N2O fluxes per unit yield in NPKM (0.55 and 0.10 kg C t(-1)) and M (0.65 and 0.13 g N t(-1)) treatments were lower than those in other treatments. Therefore, manure application could be a preferred fertilization strategy in red soils in South China C1 [Zhang Xu-bo; Sun Nan; Ding Xue-shan; Wang Bo-ren; Li Dong-chu] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Minist Agr, Key Lab Crop Nutr & Fertilizat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.

Linkage of N2O emissions to the abundance of soil ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in purple soil under long-term fertilization. Microbial nitrification and denitrification are responsible for the majority of soil nitrous (N2O) emissions. In this study, N2O emissions were measured and the abundance of ammonium oxidizers and denitrifiers were quantified in purple soil in a long-term fertilization experiment to explore their relationships. The average N2O fluxes and abundance of the amoAgene in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria during the observed dry season were highest when treated with mixed nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizer (NPK) and a single N treatment (N) using NH(4)HCO(3)as the sole N source; lower values were obtained using organic manure with pig slurry and added NPK at a ratio of 40%:60% (OMNPK),organic manure with pig slurry (OM) and returning crop straw residue plus synthetic NH(4)HCO(3)fertilizer at a ratio of 15%:85% (SRNPK). The lowest N2O fluxes were observed in the treatment that used crop straw residue(SR) and in the control with no fertilizer (CK). Soil NH(4)(+)provides the substrate for nitrification generating N2O as a byproduct. The N2O flux was significantly correlated with the abundance of the amoA gene in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (r=0.984, p<0.001), which was the main driver of nitrification. During the wet season, soil nitrate (NO3-) and soil organic matter (SOC) were found positively correlated with N2O emissions (r=0.774, p=0.041 and r=0.827, p=0.015, respectively). The nirS gene showed a similar trend with N2O fluxes. These results show the relationship between the abundance of soil microbes and N2O emissions and suggest that N2O emissions during the dry season were due to nitrification, whereas in wet season, denitrification might dominate N2O emission.

Global comprehensive evaluation shows that green manure enhances crop productivity while mitigating gaseous nitrogen losses. Green manure (GM) is promising for use in sustainable agriculture, but its impacts on nitrogen emissions from farmland and crop productivity are unclear. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis based on 2,616 data pairs from 218 studies to clarify the effects of GM. GM enhanced soil nitrogen retention to increase the crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by 3.71 % and 24.41 %, respectively, and reduce ammonia (NH3) emissions by 9.09 %, but with no significant impact on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. GM was most effective in low-quality soil and warm, humid climates, especially legume GM. Combining GM with high nitrogen fertilizer use may further reduce NH3 emissions. Machine learning models showed that GM could increase global maize and rice yields by 9.78 % and 11.10 %, respectively, and reduce NH3 emissions from major crops by 9.92 %, but increase N2O emissions from paddy fields by 9.45 %. In general, GM can enhance crop productivity and reduce agricultural environmental costs to promote green development.

Impact of tillage on greenhouse gas emissions by an agricultural crop and dynamics of N2O fluxes: Insights from automated closed chamber measurements. Our experiment aimed at studying the impact of long term tillage treatments - reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT), on CO2 and N2O emissions by soil and at describing the dynamics of N2O fluxes. Gas measurements were performed from June to October 2015 in a Belgian maize crop, with homemade automated closed chambers, allowing continuous measurement at a high temporal resolution. After 7 years of treatment, CO2 and N2O average emissions were significantly larger in the RT parcel than in the CT parcel. This observation was attributed to the effect of tillage on the distribution of crop residues within the soil profile, leading to higher soil organic C and total N contents and a greater microbial biomass in the upper layer in RT. A single N2O emission peak triggered by a sudden increase of water filled pore space (VVFPS) was observed in the beginning of the measuring campaign. The absence of large emission afterwards was most likely due to a decreasing availability of N as crop grew. N2O background fluxes showed to be significantly correlated to CO2 fluxes but not to VVFPS, while. the influence of soil temperature remained unclear. Our results question the suitability of reduced tillage as a \"climate-smart\" practice and suggest that more experiments be conducted on conservation practices and their potent negative effect on environment.

Relationships between soil organic matter pools and nitrous oxide emissions of agroecosystems in the Brazilian Cerrado. In the Brazilian Cerrado, despite the increasing adoption of no-till systems, there are still extended areas under conventional soil management systems that reduce soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and increase the emissions of greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide (N2O). Conservation agroecosystems, such as no-till, have been proposed as a strategy to mitigate agriculture-induced climatic changes through reductions in N2O emissions. However, the relationship between organic matter and N2O emissions from soils under different agroecosystems is not yet clear. This study hypothesized that agroecosystems under no-till promote an accumulation of labile and stable SOM fractions along with a reduction of N2O emissions. This study evaluated the effects of crop-rotation agroecosystems: i) on C and N pools and labile and stable SOM fractions; ii) on cumulative N2O emissions; and iii) on the relationships between SOM fractions and N2O emissions. The agricultural systems consisted of: (I) soybean followed by sorghum under no-tillage (NT1); (II) maize followed by pigeon pea under no-tillage (NT2); (III) soybean under conventional tillage followed by fallow soil (CT); (IV) and native Cerrado (CER). After CT for 18 years, following the replacement of CER, the soil C stock in the 0-20 cm layer was reduced by 0.64 t ha(-1) year(-1). The no-till systems were more efficient in accumulating labile and stable C fractions with values close to those observed under CER, and were directly related to lower soil N2O emissions. The cumulative pattern of N2O emissions was inverse to that of the following SOM fractions: microbial biomass carbon, permanganate-oxidizable carbon, particulate organic carbon, inert carbon, and humic substances. Based on principal component analysis, the CT was generally separated from the other land use systems. This separation was strongly influenced by the low C contents in the different SOM fractions and higher N2O emissions promoted by the CT. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Comparison of N2O and CO2 concentrations and fluxes in the soil profile between a Gray Lowland soil and an Andosol. We measured nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from the soil surface and in the soil through to a depth of 0.3 m, and their concentration profiles through to a depth of 0.6 m in both a Gray Lowland soil with macropores and cracks and an Andosol with undeveloped soil structure in central Hokkaido, Japan. The objective of the present study was to elucidate any differences in N2O production and flux in the soil profile between these two soil types. In the Gray Lowland soil, the N2O concentration above 0.4 m increased with an increase in soil depth. In the Andosol, there were no distinctive N2O concentration gradients in the topsoil when the N2O flux did not increase. However, the N2O concentration at a depth of 0.1 m significantly increased and this concentration was higher than the concentration below 0.2 m when the N2O flux greatly increased. Thus, the N2O concentration profiles were different between these two soils. The contribution ratios of the N2O produced in the top soil (0-0.3 m depth) to the total N2O emitted from the soil to the atmosphere in the Gray Lowland soil and the Andosol were 0.86 and 1.00, respectively, indicating that the N2O emitted from the soil to the atmosphere was mainly produced in the top soil. However, the contribution ratio of the subsoil to the N2O emitted from the Gray Lowland soil was higher than that of the Andosol. There was a significant positive correlation between the N2O flux through to a 0.3 m depth and the flux from the soil to the atmosphere in the Gray Lowland soil only. These results suggest that N2O production in the subsoil of the Gray Lowland soil could have been activated by NO3- leaching through macropores and cracks, and subsequently the N2O produced in the subsoil could have been rapidly emitted to the atmosphere through the macropores and cracks.

Impact of biochar application on nitrous oxide and methane emissions in rainfed cropping systems within a semiarid region. This study investigated the impact of biochar on Zea mays L. yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in rainfed maize fields in Northwest China. Four treatments were compared: unmodified control (CK), conventional nitrogen (BC0), nitrogen + 20 t ha-1 biochar (BC20), and nitrogen + 50 t ha-1 biochar (BC50). Results showed significant increases in grain yields with BC20 (11.1%) and BC50 (8.6%) compared to BC0. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) were reduced by 14.0%-19.5% in biochar treatments compared to CK. Methane (CH4) uptake by the fields, acting as CH4 sinks, was not significantly impacted by biochar treatments, clarifying that the biochar did not alter the farmland's inherent ability to uptake CH4. Over 2 years, the addition of nitrogen fertilizer and biochar did not markedly alter cumulative CH4 uptake. Both net greenhouse gas (NGHG) emissions and yield-scaled GHG intensity (NGHGI) were lowered by 16.7%-23.5% and 24.2%-30.3%, respectively, with biochar application. The integration of biochar effectively mitigated the GHG emission enhancement due to nitrogen fertilizer, mainly by decreasing nitrogen oxide emissions and boosting maize yields. Thus, proper biochar application would be an economical and effective strategy for mitigating gas emissions from rainfed maize cropping system in semiarid regions. Biochar significantly increased maize yield in a rainfed cropping system. N2O emission was significantly decreased by 10.9%-19.5% by biochar application. Biochar significantly decreased net global warming potentials (NGWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). Higher amount of biochar had no further decrease effect on NGWP and GHGI.

A new chamber design for measuring nitrous oxide emissions in maize crops. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural land are often estimated by measuring changes in N2O concentrations over a given period in the headspace of a gas-sampling chamber covering a specific soil area. This technique is particularly challenging in tall growing row crops such as maize (Zea mays L.), to which farmers regularly apply fertilizer banded below the seeds to ensure good crop development. Placing chambers in the inter-row space leads to bias in flux measurements, due to exclusion of fertilized and rhizosphere soil. Chambers for N2O flux measurements should therefore be placed centered over the row. A new split chamber for gas sampling was developed in this study from a closed, rectangular chamber (original chamber: 78cm x 78 cm, 51 cm height). The new chamber is applicable for use for the complete maize growing cycle until harvest. For each flux measurement, the two parts of the chambers are placed in a gas-tight seal on a collar previously inserted into soil covering a representative area of land. In a later growth stage, when plant height exceeds chamber height, stalks of developed maize plants can be fixed between the two chamber parts through a rubber-tightening opening on the top of the chamber. Air tightness of the split chamber was tested in the laboratory and the split chamber was compared with the original chamber in a field experiment with slurry injection under maize seeds. The laboratory test demonstrated similar air tightness of both chamber types. The field test yielded almost identical N2O fluxes for the original chamber (244 mu g N2O-N m(-1) h(-1)) and the split-chamber (254 mu g N2O-N m(-1) h(-1)). It can be concluded that the split chamber is an adequate gas-sampling unit, with particular advantages when flux measurements are conducted in tall growing row crops.

The measurements were carried out during: (i) a standard fertilization management (SFM) activity and (ii) a manipulation experimental (ME) test on the effects of increased and reduced application rates of urea at the late fertilization. In the course of the SFM, the irrigations following early and late nitrogen fertilization led to pulses of denitrification rates (up to 1300 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) and N2O fluxes (up to 320 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)), thanks to the combined action of high soil temperatures and not limiting nitrates and water filled pore space (WFPS). During the ME, high soil nitrates were noted in all the treatments in the first one month after the late fertilization, which promoted marked N-losses by microbial denitrification (from 500 to 1800 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) every time the soil WFPS was not limiting. At similar maize yield responses to fertilizer treatments, this result suggested no competition for N between plant roots and soil microbial community and indicated a probable surplus of nitrogen fertilizer input at the investigated farm. Correlation and regression analyses (CRA) on the whole set of data showed significant relations between both the denitrification rates and the N2O fluxes with three soil physical-chemical parameters: nitrate concentration, WFPS and temperature. Specifically, the response functions of denitrification rate to soil nitrates, WFPS and temperature could be satisfactorily modelled according to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetic, exponential and linear functions, respectively. Furthermore, the CRA demonstrated a significant exponential relationship between N2O fluxes and denitrification and simple empirical functions to predict N2O emissions from the denitrification rate appeared more fitting (higher concordance correlation coefficient) than the predictive empirical algorithm based on soil nitrates, WFPS and temperature. In this regard, the empirically established relationships between the denitrification rate on intact soil cores under field conditions and the soil variables provided local-specific threshold values and coefficients which may effectively work to calibrate and adapt existing N2O process-based simulation models to the local pedo-climatic conditions.

N2O emission factors from a wastewater irrigated land in a semiarid environment in Mexico. Irrigation with wastewater is an increasing practice around the world triggered by the large needs of water for agriculture. Many times this source of water is added by flooding to the fields, creating short temporal oxygen-depleted environments, where nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are promoted. Agriculture is responsible for up to 60% of the global annual emissions of this gas, and its emission factors (EF) must be reported. During 21 months, we installed closed chambers to measure the N2O emissions from a wastewater irrigated plot in the Mezquital Valley. Here, alfalfa, rye grass, and maize were grown in succession, receiving mainly organic N contained in the untreated wastewater and the residues of the previous crop; only maize received extra mineral fertilization of 100 kg of N ha(-1). We obtained a time series where the gaps were filled by linear interpolation. EF and N2O direct emissions were estimated by the Tier 1 approach of the IPCC. We found that the alfalfa and rye grass, which only receive organic nitrogen, produced minor N2O emissions, that reflected in lower EF (0.004 and 0.001, respectively), compared with the default value of the IPCC (0.01). In contrast, maize, which receives organic and inorganic N, lost 1% of this N input as N2O, the same as the default value (0.01). It seems that the form of N, the crop age and type influence greatly the N dynamics in this wastewater irrigated land-use system. Therefore, the Tier I approach of the IPCC seems to underestimate the N efficiency of this agroecosystem and overestimates the N2O direct emissions from alfalfa and rye grass. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal Effluxes of Greenhouse Gases Under Different Tillage and N Fertilizer Management in a Dryland Maize Mono-crop. There are few studies that have assessed greenhouse gas (GHG) effluxes under dryland agriculture, especially in South Africa. Subsequently, limited data in the sub-Saharan region impedes the formulation of policies on GHG mitigation and adaptation. Therefore, the need to study effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) was salient. The objective of the study was to assess GHG effluxes across seasons in conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) systems under nitrogen (N) fertilizer management. Gases were sampled using static PVC chambers and sampling was done by inserting a 25-mL polypropylene syringe into the chamber septa and slowly removing the gas. Samples were analysed for CO2, CH4 and N2O using gas chromatography. In winter, CH4 effluxes were higher under NT than CT for each application rate (p < 0.05). N2O efflux was higher (p < 0.05) under CT at 120 and 240 kg N ha(-1) compared to NT in summer. The CO2 effluxes of CT were higher (p < 0.05) than NT at all N application rates and seasons. Higher GHG effluxes in summer than winter was attributed to higher soil temperature and moisture. CO2 and N2O emissions were positively correlated to tillage with CH4 negatively correlated, but it has to be noted that not only the intensity of tillage influenced effluxes, but also climatic conditions played a huge role in determining the direction of effluxes. Conservation tillage is climate smart and, in this case NT at 120 kg N ha(-1), can be recommended because it sustained less effluxes especially during summer.

Zeolite application mitigates NH3 and N2O emissions from pig slurry-applied field and improves nitrogen use efficiency in Italian ryegrass-maize crop rotation system for forage production. The present study aimed to assess the efficiency of zeolite in mitigating the nitrogen (N) losses through ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from pig slurry (PS) applied to Italian ryegrass (IRG)-maize fields under a crop rotation system and the consequent effect on nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for forage production. PS was applied at rates of 150 and 200 kg N ha -1 for the IRG and maize growing seasons, respectively, with or without zeolite. Soil mineral N content and NH3 and N2O emissions were measured periodically throughout the year-round cultivation of IRG and maize. Forage yield and nutritional composition were also analyzed at the harvest time of each crop. The PS with/without zeolite application effects were interpreted by comparison with those obtained for the negative control (no -N fertilization). Soil ammonium (NH4+) content in the PS-applied plots sharply increased within the first week, then progressively decreased in both the IRG and maize growing seasons. Soil NH4+ contents in the zeolite-amended plots were higher compared to the treatment without zeolite except for the first 1 or 2 weeks after PS application when soil nitrate (NO3-) contents significantly decreased. The increase in soil NH4+ content as affected by zeolite application was more distinct in the maize growing season than in the IRG growing season. NH3 emission was predominant at the early 2 weeks after PS application. Zeolite application reduced the cumulative emission of NH3 from PS by 16.7% and 24.4% and that of N2O by 15.6% and 31.5% in the IRG growing and maize growing seasons, respectively. NUE for dry matter (DM) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) production significantly improved in annual yield basis of the IRG-maize cropping. Zeolite application in PS-applied field may represent effective management in mitigating N losses through odorous NH3 and greenhouse gas (N2O) emissions, thereby improving NUE forage production.

Nitrous oxide fluxes from Malagasy agricultural soils. In Madagascar, no-tillage practices were developed since the early 90s to prevent soil erosion and improve soil fertility. Although such practices have helped to restore soil carbon in most cases, the impact on N2O emissions has not been investigated yet. The soil N2O fluxes and concentrations were measured during the growing season of an intercropping maize-soybean on a clayey soil of the Malagasy Highlands. Management treatments consisted of direct seeding mulch based cropping system (DMC) and traditional hand-ploughing after the preceding crop residues were harvested (HP), both with low N inputs (55-57 kg N ha(-1)). No significant difference in N2O emissions was observed between treatments (DMC vs. HP). The N2O fluxes were weakly correlated to soil mineral N contents (R-2=0.13; P=0.03) while no relationship was emphasized with soil water filled pore space (WFPS), N2O Concentrations in the soil atmosphere were correlated to fluxes at the soil surface and to soil WFPS. N2O emissions at the soil surface were low ranging from 0 to 8.84 g N-N2O ha(-1) d(-1), probably due to the low mineral N content of soil. The cumulative annual N2O emission was 0.26 kg N ha(-1) for both systems. The corresponding N loss as N2O-N was around 0.5% of applied N. This is in the uncertainty range of IPCC N2O emission factor (EF), but the IPCC EF mean estimate (1%) would overestimate true N2O emissions for the soil under evaluation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Soil nitrous oxide emissions from a soybean-wheat succession under different tillage systems in Southern Brazil. No-tillage (NT) has been largely adopted in Brazil as a strategy for soil conservation, but for the last decade, there have been governmental incentives for its adoption arising from its potential for soil C accumulation. Notwithstanding, the soil mulch formed from crop residues favors the maintenance of soil moisture and nutrients in the upper soil layers, which stimulates soil microbial activity and may increase the potential for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. In addition, double-cropping systems in the same year are typical in Brazil and the impact on the fraction of fertilizer N lost as N2O needs to be evaluated. This study aimed to assess the influence of soil tillage and N fertilization on N2O emissions in a wheat-soybean succession system as commonly practiced in southern Brazil. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Soybean research station located in Southern Brazil. Treatments were conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), with and without nitrogen fertilization for the wheat and no N fertilizer for the soybean. Closed-static chambers were used to monitor N2O fluxes for two consecutive years. Together with gas monitoring, soil samples were also taken and analyzed for mineral N, soil moisture and labile carbon. Soybean yields were higher under NT, which seemed to be the result of a higher soil water availability that helped to overcome extended periods without rainfall. Soil N2O emissions were similar between CT and NT, with just a tendency for higher emissions under NT. The highest emissions occurred from the soybean crop. In the second year under NT, the emissions from the soybean crop were higher when preceded by N-fertilized wheat, but the converse was true under CT. None of the soil variables consistently correlated with N2O emissions, with mineral-N as the best predictor in the second wheat cycle and soil moisture in the first soybean cycle. Calculated emission factors were not statistically different between CT and NT and consistently lower than the IPCC default of 1 %. The calculated N2O emission intensity by relating N2O emission to grain yield showed an environmental advantage of NT compared to CT by presenting a 44 % reduction in soybean and similar values for fertilized wheat.

Crop residues exacerbate the negative effects of extreme flooding on soil quality. Extreme flood events are predicted to have a negative impact on soil quality. Currently, there is a lack of information about the effect of agricultural practices on soil functioning and microbial processes under these events. We hypothesized that the impact of flooding on soil quality will be exacerbated when crop residues are present in the soil as they will induce more extreme anaerobicity. A spring extreme flood event (10 A degrees C, 9 weeks) was simulated in mesocosms containing an arable sandy-loam soil low in nutrients. The main treatments were (1) with and without flooding and (2) with and without maize residue addition (8 Mg ha(-1)). We monitored changes in soil chemical quality indicators (e.g. pH, salinity, Fe3+, P, C, NH4 (+), NO3 (-) and organic N), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) and soil microbial community composition (PLFAs) during a prolonged flood period (9 weeks) and an 8-week \"recovery\" period after flooding. In comparison to the other treatments, flooding in the presence of crop residues resulted in a dramatic drop in soil redox potential. This was associated with the enhanced release of Fe and C into solution and an increase in CH4 emissions. In contrast, maize residues reduced potential nitrate losses and N2O emissions, possibly due to complete denitrification and microbial N immobilization. Both flooding and maize residues stimulated microbial growth and promoted a shift in microbial community composition. Following floodwater removal, most of the soil quality indicators returned to the levels of the control treatment within 5 weeks. After this short recovery phase, no major impact of flooding could be observed on plant growth (maize pot-grown). Overall, we conclude that both extreme flooding and management regime negatively impact upon a range of soil quality indicators (e.g. redox, GHG emissions); however, the soil showed high resilience and recovered quickly after floodwater removal. Further work is required to investigate the impact of repeated extreme flood events on soil quality and function over longer timescales.

Elevated atmospheric CO2 promotes the contribution of autotrophic nitrification to N2O emissions in a typical summer maize field. Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration generally stimulates nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from upland soils, leading to a promoted feedback on climate change. However, the underlying mechanisms on how elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) stimulates N2O emissions from nitrogen (N)-fertilized upland soils remain poorly known. Here, we investigated the effects of eCO(2) on soil N2O production pathways and associated gross N transformation rates, as well as on nitrifying and denitrifying microbes. Based on a 13 years of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) platform, we found that N2O emissions were significantly increased by 46.7% under eCO(2) in a typical summer-maize field. The N-15 tracing experiment showed that autotrophic nitrification rate was significantly increased by 11.6% under eCO(2), coincided with the significantly higher abundance and shift composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) under eCO(2). Also, eCO(2) enhanced gross ammonium (NH4+) immobilization rate but reduced gross nitrate (NO3-) immobilization rate. Autotrophic nitrification accounted for approximately 78% of N2O emissions, followed by heterotrophic nitrification (about 19%) and denitrification (about 3%). It was found that eCO(2) increased carbon (C) deposition in soil, which could affect the availability of soil labile organic C and N and alter the composition and activity of nitrifiers. These changes promoted the N2O production derived from autotrophic nitrification, resulting in higher N2O emissions under eCO(2). We could deduce that nitrifier denitrification contributed to the increased N2O emissions greatly under eCO(2), derived by strongly stimulated ammonia oxidation and microbial respiration (i.e. higher soil CO2 emissions) caused suboxic conditions (i.e. lower soil oxygen (O-2) concentration), along with higher abundance ratios of (nirK+nirS)/nosZ. Our results suggest that controlling autotrophic nitrification appropriately is crucial for mitigating N2O emissions from upland soils under rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.

Effect of slurry dry matter content, application technique and timing on emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gas from cattle slurry applied to grassland soils in Ireland. Agriculture contributes to 98% and 33% of ammonia and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Ireland, respectively. Those emissions are mainly associated with livestock production. The Gothenburg Protocol and the EU National Emissions Ceilings Directive are policy drivers which set new and more demanding targets from 2020 to reduce these gaseous emissions. A field experiment was set up in Wexford (Ireland) between April 2009 and August 2010, on a grassland site established with a uniform ryegrass (Lolium perenne) sward for more than ten years. The objective was to investigate the impact of slurry dry matter (DM) content, application technique and timing of application on the overall GHG balance from cattle slurry applied to grassland soils. The treatments on plots were a control, calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and cattle slurry, either grass-based or maize-based and with varying DM contents, applied by mimicking trailing shoe and splash plate application. The dry matter contents were varied by mixing different ratios of faeces and urine. The results showed that, while ammonia (NH3) volatilisation losses were significantly increased on slurry spread plots, cumulative direct nitrous oxide emissions, and corresponding emission factors, were significantly higher when applying CAN. In terms of GHG field balance, the potential decrease in indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, calculated from a reduction of ammonia volatilisation losses using trailing shoe as opposed to splash plate, could be easily offset by an increase in direct N2O emissions and ecosystem respiration. Switching from summer to spring application was much more efficient for mitigation of both NH3 and GHG emissions, due to favourable soil and climatic factors which enhanced crop growth. Any potential trade-off between NH3 and N2O emissions was cancelled, leading to an overall positive effect on reactive nitrogen losses and offering agronomic benefits to farmers.

Characteristics of N2 and N2O Fluxes from a Cultivated Black Soil: A Case Study through In Situ Measurement Using the 15N Gas Flux Method. The magnitudes and source partitioning of soil dinitrogen (N-2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are not well documented, yet. To address both issues for black soil subject to a typical cool temperate climate, soil N2O and N-2 fluxes following the basal application event of an ammonium-based fertilizer (labeled by N-15) for maize were simultaneously measured in situ by using the N-15 gas flux ((15)NFG) method. During the two-month field experiment, the measured N-2 and N2O fluxes cumulated to 1.61 +/- 0.47 and 0.12 +/- 0.01 kg N ha(-1), respectively, showing N2O to N2O plus N-2 ratios (R-N2O) of 0.02-0.31 (0.15 on average). Temperature was identified as a key factor regulating the total soil N-2 fluxes (r(2) = 0.27, p < 0.01), despite the N-2 fluxes originated from nitrate denitrification related to dissolved organic carbon concentrations (r(2) = 0.39, p < 0.01). Differently, both temperature and soil moisture jointly accounted for 85% and 74% of the variances in the N2O fluxes and the R-N2O values, respectively (p < 0.01). Moreover, the process(es) other than autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification could be of substantial importance for the soil N2O emissions. Our findings emphasized the importance of temperature in regulating N-2 emissions from black soil and the possible site- and/or time specificity of a soil factors-based parametrization of R-N2O. In addition, this study implicates that labeling a nitrogen substrate of nitrification while using the N-15 enrichment of N2O is necessary to more accurately quantify total soil N-2 fluxes in situ by using the (15)NFG approach even though further confirmation in future studies is still needed.

Soil nitrous oxide emissions as affected by long-term tillage, cropping systems and nitrogen fertilization in Southern Brazil. Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are affected by management practices, but little information is available on the interactive effects of tillage, cropping systems and N sources in tropical and subtropical soils. In an 18-yr old experiment located in a subtropical Acrisol of Southern Brazil we conducted a sequence of two trials. The 1-year trial (October 2003-2004) was set to evaluate the long-term effects of tillage [CT: conventional; and NT: no-tillage] and cropping systems [O/M: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.)/maize (Zea mays L.); and V/M; vetch (Vicia sativa L.)/maize] on soil N2O emissions, either in the post-management period (45 days after desiccation and knife-rolling of winter cover crops) or in the whole year. The second and short-term trial (October-November 2004) was carried out to compare the impact of N sources [urea (mineral) and legume-residue of vetch (biologically fixed), both at 180 kg N ha(-1)] on soil N2O emissions during 53 days after cover-crop management. Air sampling was carried out by static chambers and N2O analysis by gas chromatography. In the 45-day post-management period of the 1-year trial, soil N2O emissions were practically not affected by tillage systems, but increased 4 times due to vetch residues (average of 0.40 +/- 0.08 kg N ha(-1) in V/M versus 0.10 +/- 0.05 kg N ha(-1) in O/M) and related with soil contents of NO3--N, NH4+-N, and dissolved organic C (DOC). Over the whole year, soil N2O emissions under CT were similar for grass- and legume-based cropping systems and averaged 0.43 +/- 0.17 kg N ha(-1), while NT exacerbated N2O emissions in the legume-based cropping system (0.80 +/- 0.07 kg N ha(-1) in V/M versus -0.07 +/- 0.06 kg N ha(-1) in O/M). Maize yield was not affected by tillage, but increased from 2.32 Mg ha(-1) in O/M to 4.44 Mg ha(-1) in V/M. Yield-scaled N2O emissions varied from -33g N2O-N Mg-1 grain in NT O/M to 179g N2O-N Mg-1 grain in NT VIM, and were intermediate in CT soil (106 and 156 g N2O-N Mg-lgrain in V/M and O/M cropping systems, respectively). In the short-term trial, the N2O emitted in excess relative to the control treatment (O/M without N fertilizer) was at least 3 times greater with urea-N (0.44% of applied N) than with legume-residue-Nsource (0.13% of applied N). Yield-scaled N2O emission after vetch residues management (67 g N Mg-1 grain) was half of that after urea-N application (152 g N Mg-1 grain). Partially supplying the maize N requirements with winter legume cover-crops may be a feasible strategy to mitigate soil N2O emissions in the subtropical conservation agriculture.

Nitrous oxide emissions in maize on mollisols in the Pampas of Argentina. The objectives of this study were i) to measure the soil N2O fluxes in a cropping system currently adopted by farmers of the region (FP), and in an ecologically intensified cropping system (EI) over two consecutive maize growing seasons (2011-12 and 2012-13), and ii) to relate N2O fluxes to soil factors. Gas fluxes were measured using vented static chambers, from October through April in each season. Fluxes of N2O ranged from 3 to 88 jig N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) in 2011-12, and between 3 and 97 jig N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) in 2012-13. There was a significant (p < 0.05) interaction in N2O fluxes between management systems and sampling dates (p < 0.05) in both seasons. The highest N2O fluxes were observed often following a precipitation event and shortly after N fertilization. While management system impacted on maize grain yield, it had no significant (p < 0.05) effect on cumulative N2O emissions, which were, on average across two seasons, 558 g N2O-N ha(-1) for the EI treatment and 578 g N2O-N ha(-1) for the FP treatment. Cumulative N2O emissions tended to be 20% greater over 153 days in 2012-13 compared with over 156 days in 2011-12 mainly due to differences in total and timing precipitations. As there were no differences in cumulative N2O emissions between managements but grain yield was higher under EI, this treatment had lower yield-based N2O emissions (75 g N2O-N Mg-1 grain) compared with FP treatment (94 g N2O-N Mg-1 grain). The results showed that a moderate increase in N rate (10 kg N ha(-1)), combined with N split-application and UAN (urea-ammonium nitrate) as N source, as well as other crop management practices, can be a viable alternative to improve maize productivity without increasing the N2O environmental impact.

Effects of no-tillage on greenhouse gas emissions in maize fields in a semi-humid temperate climate region*. Agricultural tillage practices have a significant impact on the generation and consumption of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the primary causes of global warming. Two tillage systems, conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), were compared to evaluate their effects on GHG emissions in this study. Averaged from 2018 to 2020, significant decreases of CO2 and N2O emissions by 7.4% and 51.1% were observed in NT as compared to those of CT. NT was also found to inhibit the soil CH4 uptake. In this study, soil was a source of CO2 and N2O but a sink for CH4. The effect of soil temperature on the fluxes of CO2 was more pronounced than that of soil moisture. However, soil temperature and soil moisture had a weak correlation with CH4 and N2O flux variations. As compared to CT, NT did not affect maize yields but significantly reduced global warming potential (GWP) by 8.07%. For yield-scaled GWP, no significant difference was observed in NT (9.63) and CT (10.71). Taken together, NT was an environment-friendly tillage practice to mitigate GHG emissions in the soil under the tested conditions.

Processes and factors controlling N2O production in an intensively managed low carbon calcareous soil under sub-humid monsoon conditions. An automated system for continuous measurement of N2O fluxes on an hourly basis was employed to study N2O emissions in an intensively managed low carbon calcareous soil under sub-humid temperate monsoon conditions. N2O emissions occurred mainly within two weeks of application of NH4+-based fertilizer and total N2O emissions in wheat (average 0.35 or 0.21 kg N ha(-1) season(-1)) and maize (average 1.47 or 0.49 kg N ha(-1) season(-1)) under conventional and optimum N fertilization (300 and 50-122 kg N ha(-1), respectively) were lower than previously reported from low frequency measurements. Results from closed static chamber showed that N2O was produced mainly from nitrification of NH4+-based fertilizer, with little denitrification occurring due to limited readily oxidizable carbon and low soil moisture despite consistently high soil nitrate-N concentrations. Significant reductions in N2O emissions can be achieved by optimizing fertilizer N rates, using nitrification inhibitors, or changing from NH4+- to NO3--based fertilizers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

CO2 and N2O Emissions from Spring Maize Soil under Alternate Irrigation between Saline Water and Groundwater in Hetao Irrigation District of Inner Mongolia, China. Alternative irrigation between saline water and groundwater can alleviate shortages of available agricultural water while effectively slowing the adverse effects of saline water on the soil-crop system when compared with continuous irrigation with saline water and blending irrigation between saline water and groundwater. In 2018, we tested the effect on soil CO2 and N2O emissions by two types of irrigation regimes (alternating groundwater and saline water (GW-SW), and alternating groundwater, followed by two cycles of saline water (GW-SW-SW)) between groundwater and three levels of salinity of irrigation water (mineralization of 2 g/L, 3.5 g/L, and 5 g/L), analyzed the correlation between gas emissions and soil properties, calculated comprehensive global warming potential (GWP), and investigated the maize yield. The results show that, with the same alternate irrigation regime, cumulative CO2 emissions decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity, and cumulative N2O emissions increased. Cumulative CO2 emissions were higher in the GW-SW regime for the same irrigation water salinity, and cumulative N2O emissions were higher in the GW-SW-SW regime. The GW-SW-SW regime had less comprehensive GWP and maize yield as compared to the GW-SW regime. The 2 g/L salinity in both regimes showed larger comprehensive GWP and maize yield. The 3.5 g/L salinity under the GW-SW regime will be the best choice while considering that the smaller comprehensive GWP and the larger maize yield are appropriate for agricultural implication. Fertilizer type and irrigation amount can be taken into consideration in future research direction.

Change in maize yield, N use efficiencies and climatic warming potential after urea combined with Nitrapyrin and NBPT during the growing season in a black soil. Increasing nitrogen (N) utilization and reducing N losses are a globally accepted strategy for N fertilizer application. However, little information has been reported on the fate of N when urea (U) and nitrification and/or urease inhibitors are used in black soils. Therefore, a two-year field experiment was conducted with three N fertilizer application treatments, including urea-only, urea combined with nitrification inhibitor (U+NI), urea combined with NI and urease inhibitor (UI) treatments. Maize (Zea mays L.) yield, N use efficiency, gas emissions, global warming potential (GWP), and apparent N loss were determined. Compared to the other treatments, the U+NI+UI treatment had the significantly (P < 0.05) highest maize yield (11.2 t ha-1), N recovery efficiency (44.5%), agronomic N efficiency (28.7 kg kg-1) and N partial factor productivity (75.8 kg kg-1). Moreover, the U+NI+UI treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the peak of Ammonia (NH3) volatilization and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, cumulative NH3 volatilization and N2O emissions, and apparent N loss compared to the U treatment. Although there was no significant difference in cumulative N2O emissions between the U+NI+UI and U+NI treatments, the U+NI+UI treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced cumulative NH3 volatilization by 55.3%, GWP by 16.2%, and apparent N loss by 28.2% compared to the U+NI treatment. Overall, the combination of urea with urease and inhibitors is a good practice to improve maize yield and N use efficiency while reducing environmental impacts in black soil.

Juss.) and Gliricidia sepium Jacquin, locally known as 'mata-raton', are used to control pests of maize. Their application, however, is known to affect soil microorganisms. We investigated if these extracts affected emissions of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), important greenhouse gases, and dynamics of soil inorganic N. Soil was treated with extracts of neem, mata-raton or lambda-cyhalothrin, used as chemical control. The soil was amended with or without urea and incubated at 40% and 100% water holding capacity (WHC). Concentrations of ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) and emissions of CH4, CO2 and N2O were monitored for 7 d. Treating urea-amended soil with extracts of neem, mata-raton or lambda-cyhalothrin reduced the emission of CO2 significantly compared to the untreated soil with the largest decrease found in the latter. Oxidation of CH4 was inhibited by extracts of neem in the unamended soil, and by neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin in the urea-amended soil compared to the untreated soil. Neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin reduced the N2O emission from the unamended soil incubated at 40%WHC compared to the untreated soil. Extracts of neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin had no significant effect on dynamics of NH4+, NO2- and NO3-. It was found that emission Of CO2 and oxidation of CH4 was inhibited in the urea-amended soil treated with extracts of neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin, but ammonification, N2O emission and nitrification were not affected.

Assessing nitrous oxide and nitrate leaching mitigation potential in US corn crop systems using the DNDC model. Nitrous oxide (N2O, a potent greenhouse gas; GHG) is emitted at relatively high rates from corn-based agricultural systems. N2O mitigation strategies, in addition to reducing GHG emissions, ideally would not increase other harmful pollutants (such as leached nitrate, NO3, or volatilized ammonia, NH3) or decrease crop yield. We used the Denitrification-Decomposition model (DNDC) to simulate an array of single and combined interventions to corn management across broad range of physical conditions (climate and soil) in the Midwest US. We assumed a typical crop management baseline of continuous corn or corn-soy with conventional tillage and urea-ammonium nitrate fertilizer broadcast to the soil surface. Interventions included fertilizer nitrogen (N) form, controlled-release N, addition of nitrification inhibitors, N rate, split sidedress N applications, sub-soil N placement, and reduced tillage. Single-factor interventions which reduced N2O in all locales included a change to urea fertilizer, nitrification inhibitors, reductions to N rate, and use of N injection: urea fertilizer and nitrification inhibitors both reduced N2O emissions on average (30 and 9%, respectively) while simultaneously reducing NO3 leaching and mostly neutral effects to yield; N rate reductions reduced N2O (11%) but had modest negative effects to yield. Other single-factor interventions increase N2O emissions or N leaching on average but could have beneficial effects under some conditions. Combined interventions frequently include (> 50% of the time) urea, nitrification inhibitors, and reduced N. Interventions that, even when combined with other interventions, do not reduce N2O emissions and N leaching include anhydrous ammonia fertilizer, controlled release, and injection. Controlled-release fertilizer results were contrary to those reported in most field studies indicating that DNDC's simulation of linear N release over time may be too simplistic to replicate field conditions.

No-tillage with straw mulching and re-using old film boost crop yields and mitigate soil N2O emissions in wheat-maize intercropping at arid irrigated regions. Water shortage and heavy greenhouse gas emissions are threatening agricultural sustainability with food security severely, and becoming a major issue in arid areas. It is unclear whether improved farming systems on stripintercropping integrated with no-tillage with straw returning and re-using old film practices can be developed to reduce soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and boost crop yields for tackling those issues. A four-year field experiment for wheat-maize intercropping was carried on straw residue and film management of northwestern China in 2014-2017 and aimed to comprehensively assess crop yields and soil N2O emissions. The results showed that NTSMF (no-tillage with straw mulching and re-using old film), NTSSF (no-tillage with straw standing and reusing old film), and CTSF (conventional tillage with straw incorporation and mulching new film every year) treatments increased grain yields by 15.1%, 13.7%, and 12.8% respectively, compared to CTF (conventional tillage with no straw returning and mulching new film every year, the control treatment). NTSMF, NTSSF, and CTSF treatments had greater water use efficiency by 15.7%, 13.1%, and 14.2% than CTF, respectively. On the contrary, NTSMF and NTSSF treatments had lower soil N2O emissions (NE) by 23.9% and 20.4% than CTF, and lower by 19.8% and 16.0% than CTSF, respectively. No-tillage practice used more soil moisture and produced more grain yields but emitted less N2O than conventional tillage, NTSMF and NTSSF treatments reduced soil N2O emission per volume of evapotranspiration (WUENE) by 23.6% and 20.9%, and reduced soil N2O emission intensity (NEI) by 33.9% and 30.0% in comparison to CTF. The better effect on the reduction of NE, WUENE, and SEI was found in NTSMF, and the three indicators were successively decreased by 5.3%, 4.4%, and 6.9% over NTSSF in 2016-2017. NTSMF reduced NE and boosted GY was attributed to increased synchronicity of water demand and reduced adverse effects of soil temperature variations of both intercrops' strips. Our study concluded that grain yields were enhanced and soil N2O emissions were reduced by NTSMF treatment, and NTSMF treatment is a practical cropping production system for environmentally clean in an arid irrigated region.

Exploring wheat-based management strategies to balance agricultural production and environmental sustainability in a wheat-maize cropping system using the DNDC model. Faced with the great challenge of food demand and environmental pollution, optimizing agricultural practices can potentially balance food security and environmental protection. In this study, the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was applied to explore the effect of wheat-based management strategies on crop productivity and greenhouse gas emissions in the wheat-maize system. The DNDC model was tested against crop yield, daily nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and cumulative N2O emissions determined from field measurements in a typical winter wheat-summer maize cropping system. Model evaluations demonstrated a good agreement between the observations and simulated crop yield (4.4%& nbsp;<= NRMSE <= 8.0%), daily N2O fluxes (0.68 <= d <= 0.88), and cumulative N2O emissions (4.9%<= NRMSE <= 11.9%). By adopting sensitivity analysis, the DNDC model then assessed the impacts on crop yield and cumulative N2O emissions of multiple management practices from the winter wheat season. Delaying the sowing date from October 7 to November 4 reduced annual yield by 1.9%, while cumulative N2O emissions were increased by 10.4%. Furthermore, postponing the supplementary irrigation date from April 1 to May 20 decreased annual yield by 2.4% without affecting cumulative N2O emissions. An N fertilizer rate of 120-150 kg N ha(-1) was able to reduce N usage and cumulative N2O emissions without sacrificing annual yield. Despite an improvement in the annual yield at the 0-30 cm tillage depth by 2.9%, cumulative N2O emissions increased by 11.6%. The results suggest that sowing in early October, applying supplementary irrigation in early April, an N fertilizer rate of 120-150 kg N ha(-1), and no-tillage from the winter wheat season can improve crop yield and mitigate N2O emissions. This is conducive to the synergism of agricultural production and environmental sustainability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in response to increasing fertilizer addition in maize (Zea mays L.) agriculture in western Kenya. National and regional efforts are underway to increase fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa, where attaining food security is a perennial challenge and mean fertilizer use in many countries is < 10 % of nationally recommended rates. Increases in nitrogen (N) inputs will likely cause increased emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). We established experimental plots with different rates of N applied to maize (Zea mays) in a field with a history of nutrient additions in western Kenya and measured N2O fluxes. Fertilizer was applied by hand at 0, 50, 75, 100, and 200 kg N ha(-1) in a split application on March 22 and April 20, 2010. Gas sampling was conducted daily during the week following applications, and was otherwise collected weekly or biweekly until June 29, 2010. Cumulative fluxes were highest from the 200 kg N ha(-1) treatment, with emissions of 810 g N2O-N ha(-1); fluxes from other treatments ranged from 620 to 710 g N2O-N ha(-1), but with no significant differences among treatments. Emissions of N2O during the 99-day measurement period represented < 0.1 % of added fertilizer N for all treatments. Though limited to a single year, these results provide further evidence that African agricultural systems may have N2O emission factors substantially lower than the global mean.

Mitigation impact of minimum tillage on CO2 and N2O emissions from a Mediterranean maize cropped soil under low-water input management. Reduced tillage might reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cropped soils. However the topic is somehow still controversial, since lower CO2 emissions achieved through reduced soil mineralization might be offset by higher N2O losses from less disturbed soil, because of higher water filled pore space. This work aimed to clarify the potential GHG mitigation benefits of minimum tillage (MT), as opposed to mouldboard ploughing (CT), for Mediterranean maize cultivations under low water input management. To this end, soil CO2 and N2O fluxes were monitored at high time resolution by means of a newly developed automated system of closed static chambers coupled to a field gas photoacoustic detector. Relative to CT, cumulated CO2 emissions appeared significantly reduced in MT over three months after the autumn ploughing (by about 30%) and along the spring-summer cultivation (by about 28%), for similar maize yields. N2O emissions from MT showed restrained averaged values relative to CT (by 40% and 18% for fallow and maize periods, respectively); however differences might not be significant. For both treatments, N2O emission factors were lower than the 1% IPCC default value (0.40 and 0.28 for CT and MT, respectively), following the restrained irrigation water input along the drought period. Results indicate that MT reduced GHG emissions both (i) in the short-term, likely due to the increased decomposition of soil organic matter in the ploughed soil (CT), mainly concentrated within the first week after deep tillage; (ii) in the longer-term, likely through its capacity to constrain the daily soil temperature fluctuations in the drought periods along the spring-summer maize cultivation. At this stage, the low-water input management might have played a key role in mediating the response of N2O emissions to MT treatment. These findings suggest that minimum tillage could entail consistent GHG benefits under the drip irrigation management in Mediterranean croplands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nonlinear nitrous oxide (N2O) response to nitrogen fertilizer in on-farm corn crops of the US Midwest. Row-crop agriculture is a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) globally, and results from recent field experiments suggest that significant decreases in N2O emissions may be possible by decreasing nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs without affecting economic return from grain yield. We tested this hypothesis on five commercially farmed fields in Michigan, USA planted with corn in 2007 and 2008. Six rates of N fertilizer (0-225 kg N ha-1) were broadcast and incorporated before planting, as per local practice. Across all sites and years, increases in N2O flux were best described by a nonlinear, exponentially increasing response to increasing N rate. N2O emission factors per unit of N applied ranged from 0.6% to 1.5% and increased with increasing N application across all sites and years, especially at N rates above those required for maximum crop yield. At the two N fertilizer rates above those recommended for maximum economic return (135 kg N ha-1), average N2O fluxes were 43% (18 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1) and 115% (26 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1) higher than were fluxes at the recommended rate, respectively. The maximum return to nitrogen rate of 154 kg N ha-1 yielded an average 8.3 Mg grain ha-1. Our study shows the potential to lower agricultural N2O fluxes within a range of N fertilization that does not affect economic return from grain yield. C1 [Hoben, J. P.; Robertson, G.

Inhibitory Effects of Biochar on N2O Emissions through Soil Denitrification in Huanghuaihai Plain of China and Estimation of Influence Time. Biochar application is considered an effective method for reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of various biochar dosages on soil N2O emissions and the duration of one-time biochar application remain unclear. The effects of different biochar application rates and a one-time application on soil N2O emissions in the Huanghuaihai Plain of China were investigated through a field experiment from 2020 to 2022. In the wheat and maize rotation system, six treatments were administered: no biochar (C0); 2 (C1), 4 (C2), 8 (C3), and 12 t/hm(2) biochar (C4) applied annually; and a one-time application of 12 t/hm(2) biochar (CS) in 2018. Our results indicate that, compared with C0, biochar significantly inhibited soil N2O emissions, particularly in the C3 and C4 treatments, with reductions of 31.36-56.21% and 36.92-52.45%, respectively. However, CS did not significantly affect soil N2O emissions during the study period. These findings suggest that the biochar's inhibitory effect on soil N2O emissions is contingent upon the dosage and frequency of application. A structural equation model revealed that biochar decreases soil N2O emissions by enhancing the reduction in N2O during denitrification. Under the conditions of this experiment, based on a logistic ecological model, a one-time application of 12 t/hm(2) biochar was projected to significantly reduce soil N2O emissions for approximately 1.77 years. On the whole, biochar reduces soil N2O emissions mainly by regulating N2O production through denitrification, and the duration of this inhibition of N2O emissions mainly depends on the application amount and frequency of biochar application.

Enrichment of nosZ-type denitrifiers by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi mitigates N2O emissions from soybean stubbles. Hotspots of N2O emissions are generated from legume residues during decomposition. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from co-cultivated intercropped plants may proliferate into the microsites and interact with soil microbes to reduce N2O emissions. Yet, the mechanisms by which or how mycorrhizal hyphae affect nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the legume residues remain ambiguous. Here, a split-microcosm experiment was conducted to assess hyphae of Rhizophagus aggregatus from neighbouring maize on overall N2O emissions from stubbles of nodulated or non-nodulated soybean. Soil microbes from fields intercropped with maize/soybean amended with fertilizer nitrogen (SS-N1) or unamended (SS-N0) were added to the soybean chamber only. AMF hyphae consistently reduced N2O emissions by 20.8%-61.5%. Generally, AMF hyphae promoted the abundance of N2O-consuming (nosZ-type) denitrifiers and altered their community composition. The effects were partly associated with increasing MBC and DOC. By contrast, AMF reduced the abundance of nirK-type denitrifiers in the nodulated SS-N0 treatment only and that of AOB in the non-nodulated SS-N1 treatment. Taken together, our results show that AMF reduced N2O emissions from soybean stubbles, mainly through the promotion of N2O-consuming denitrifiers. This holds promise for mitigating N2O emissions by manipulating the efficacious AMF and their associated microbes in cereal/legume intercropping systems.

Soil N2O emissions with different reduced tillage methods during the establishment of Miscanthus in temperate grassland. An increase in renewable energy and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops is expected in order to meet global greenhouse gas (GHG) targets. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, and this paper addresses a knowledge gap concerning soil N2O emissions over the possible \"hot spot\" of land use conversion from established pasture to the biofuel crop Miscanthus. The work aims to quantify the impacts of this land use change on N2O fluxes using three different cultivation methods. Three replicates of four treatments were established: Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) planted without tillage; Mxg planted with light tillage; a novel seed-based Miscanthus hybrid planted with light tillage under bio-degradable mulch film; and a control of uncultivated established grass pasture with sheep grazing. Soil N2O fluxes were recorded every 2 weeks using static chambers starting from preconversion in April 2016 and continuing until the end of October 2017. Monthly soil samples were also taken and analysed for nitrate and ammonium. There was no significant difference in N2O emissions between the different cultivation methods. However, in comparison with the uncultivated pasture, N2O emissions from the cultivated Miscanthus plots were 550%-819% higher in the first year (April to December 2016) and 469%-485% higher in the second year (January to October 2017). When added to an estimated carbon cost for production over a 10 year crop lifetime (including crop management, harvest, and transportation), the measured N2O conversion cost of 4.13 Mg CO2-eq./ha represents a 44% increase in emission compared to the base case. This paper clearly shows the need to incorporate N2O fluxes during Miscanthus establishment into assessments of GHG balances and life cycle analysis and provides vital knowledge needed for this process. This work therefore also helps to support policy decisions regarding the costs and benefits of land use change to Miscanthus.

Effect of the nitrification inhibitor DMPP on nitrous oxide emissions and the stabilization of ammonium following the injection of dairy slurry and digestate in a soil-column experiment. Injection of slurry or digestate below maize seeds is a relatively new technique developed to improve nitrogen use efficiency. However, this practice has the major drawback of increasing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The application of a nitrification inhibitor (NI) is an effective method to reduce these emissions. To evaluate the effect of the NI 3,4-dimethypyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on N2O emissions and the stabilization of ammonium, a two-factorial soil-column experiment was conducted. PVC pipes (20 cm diameter and 30 cm length) were used as incubation vessels for the soil-columns. The trial consisted of four treatments in a randomized block design with four replications: slurry injection, slurry injection + DMPP, digestate injection, and digestate injection + DMPP. During the 47-day incubation period, N2O fluxes were measured twice a week and cumulated by linear interpolation of the gas-fluxes of consecutive measurement dates. After completion of the gas flux measurement, concentration of ammonium and nitrate within the soil-columns was determined. DMPP delayed the conversion of ammonium within the manure injection zone significantly. This effect was considerably more pronounced in treatment digestate + NI than in treatment slurry + NI. Regarding the cumulated N2O emissions, no difference between slurry and digestate treatments was determined. DMPP reduced the release of N2O significantly. Transferring the results into practice, the use of DMPP is a promising way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and nitrate leaching, following the injection of slurry or digestate.

However, increasing N availability oftentimes catalyzes the release of N into the surrounding environment, in particular nitrous oxide (N2O) a potent greenhouse gas.

Enhanced-efficiency nitrogen fertilizers reduce winter losses of nitrous oxide, but not of ammonia, from no-till soil in a subtropical agroecosystem. Nitrogen (N) gas losses can be reduced by using enhanced-efficiency N (EEN) fertilizers such as urease inhibitors and coating technologies. In this work, we assessed the potential ofEENfertilizers to reduce winter losses of nitrous oxide (N2O-N) and ammonia (NH3-N) from a subtropical field experiment on a clayey Inceptisol under no-till in Southern Brazil. TheEENsources used included urea containingN-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (UR+NBPT), polymer-coated urea (P-CU) and copper-and-boron-coated urea (CuB-CU) in addition to common urea (UR) and a control treatment without N fertilizer application. N2O-N andNH(3)-N losses were assessed by using the static chamber method and semi-open static collectors, respectively. Both N2O-N andNH(3)-N exhibited two large peaks with an intervening period of low soil moisture and air temperature. Although the short-term effect was limited to the first few days after application,UR +NBPTurea decreased soil N2O-N emissions by 38% relative toUR. In contrast, urease inhibitor technology had no effect onNH(3)-N volatilization. Both coating technologies (CuB-CUand P-CU) were ineffective in reducing N losses via N2O production orNH(3)volatilization. The N2O emission factor (% N applied released as N2O) was unaffected by all N sources and amounted to only 0.48% of N applied-roughly one-half the default factor ofIPCCTier 1 (1%). Based on our findings, usingNBPT-treated urea in the cold winter season in subtropical agroecosystems provides environmental benefits in the form of reduced soil N2O emissions; however, fertilizer coating technologies provide no agronomic (NH3) or environmental (N2O) advantages.

Direct measurements unveil overestimations in nitrous oxide emissions from legume-based strip intercropping. Accurate evaluation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from legume<bold>-</bold>based intercropping is key to supporting the agricultural green transition. However, current methods often ignore the direct emissions from the interspecific interaction row of legume/cereal intercropping. Here, a two-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the difference between direct measurement and theoretical estimation of N2O emissions and soil respiration from maize/peanut and maize/soybean strip intercropping. Results showed that theoretical estimation overestimated the N2O emissions from interaction row by 12 - 15 % compared to direct measurement (P < 0.05). This overestimation occurred mainly during the N2O emissions peak (lasting 5 - 7 days) after topdressing N fertilization, which accounted for 21 - 49 % of the overestimation. Soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations in the interaction row were 33 - 129 % and 26 - 96 % lower than the weighted average of the crop rows following topdressing N fertilization (P < 0.05). However, the soil respiration of the interaction row did not differ between direct measurement and theoretical estimation, which may indicate N is the key interaction elements for intercropped legume and cereal rather than carbon. Furthermore, the uncertainty in theoretical estimation of N2O emissions from legume-based intercropping was increases with the decrease of strip width, which mainly due to the increasing contribution of interaction zone. In conclusion, theoretical estimation can lead to an overestimation of N2O emissions, underscoring the necessity for direct measurement, especially as strip width narrows with increased proportion of interspecific interactions zones.

Short-term grazing of cover crops and maize residue impacts on soil greenhouse gas fluxes in two Mollisols. An integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS), when managed properly, can help in mitigating soil surface greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, the impacts of an ICLS on GHG fluxes are poorly understood. The present study was conducted at two sites (northern Brookings [Brookings-N] and northwestern Brookings [Brookings-NW]) established in 2016 and 2017, respectively, under loamy soils in South Dakota. The specific objective was to evaluate the impact of cover crops (CCs) and grazed CCs under oat (Avena sativa L.)-CCs-maize (Zea mays L.) rotation on GHG fluxes. Study treatments included the following: (a) a legume-dominated CC (LdC), (b) a cattle-grazed LdC (LdC+G), (c) a grass-dominated CC (GdC), (d) a cattle-grazed GdC (GdC+G), and (e) one without CC or grazing (NC). Greenhouse gas monitoring occurred weekly during the growing crop seasons in 2016 and 2017 for Brookings-N and in 2017 and 2018 for Brookings-NW. Data showed that cumulative CO2 and N2O fluxes at Brookings-N were lower for GdC+G (4042 kg C ha(-1) for CO2 and 1499 g N ha(-1) for N2O) than for LdC+G (4819 kg C ha(-1) for CO2 and 2017 g N ha(-1) for N2O), indicating the superiority of GdC+G over LdC+G in reducing GHG fluxes. However, no effect from grazed CC on cumulative CO2 and N2O fluxes were observed at the Brookings-NW site. Cumulative CH4 flux was not affected by an ICLS at either site. This short-term investigation showed that, in general, CCs and grazing of CCs and maize residue did not impact GHG fluxes.

Nitrogen and carbon addition changed nitrous oxide emissions from soil aggregates in straw-incorporated soil. Purpose The effects of straw incorporation on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission at the soil aggregate scale have yet to be elucidated, especially with supplemental nitrogen (N) and/or organic carbon (OC). The objective of this study was to evaluate N2O emission across different size soil aggregates of 6-year straw-incorporated soil as affected by exogenous N and OC treatments. Materials and methods In the present study, the N2O emission from different particle size soil aggregates (> 2, 1-2, 0.25-1, and < 0.25 mm) were investigated with/without 6-year maize straw incorporation under protected vegetable production. Ammonium sulfate (100 mg N kg(-1)) or ammonium sulfate (100 mg N kg(-1)) + glucose (100 mg C kg(-1)) were applied to these soil aggregates along with an unamended treatment (Control, CK) and incubated in a robotized continuous on-line incubation system for 200 h at 20celcius and 25% gravimetric water content. The dynamics of N2O emission was conducted in closed bottles with 21% initial oxygen concentration. Results and discussion The results showed that the proportion of > 1 mm aggregates and < 1 mm aggregates in straw-incorporated soil were increased 10.2% and decreased 29.1%, respectively, than those in no straw-incorporated soil. For all investigated treatments, < 0.25 mm aggregates had the highest cumulative N2O emission with 2.15-45.1 nmol N g(-1) across all aggregate sizes. Cumulative N2O emission in < 0.25 mm aggregate of straw-incorporated soil was greater than that in no straw-incorporated soil without exogenous N and OC addition. N addition stimulated N2O emission from all size aggregates, and the N-stimulating effects were enhanced by the simultaneous addition of glucose. With exogenous N, N, and OC additions, cumulative N2O emission in > 2 mm, 1-2 mm, and 0.25-1 mm aggregates of straw-incorporated soil was greater than that in no straw-incorporated soil. Conclusions These results suggested that the characteristic of N2O emissions across different size aggregates from straw-incorporated soil is altered with supplemental N and OC. The study highlights that the N2O emission from straw-incorporated soil was stimulated by exogenous organic carbon and nitrogen addition within > 0.25 mm aggregate.

Oil-based polyurethane-coated urea reduces nitrous oxide emissions in a corn field in a Maryland loamy sand soil. Urea is the most widely used N fertilizer due to its high N concentration (46%), cost effectiveness and ease of handling. However, urea is susceptible to loss as N2O, a greenhouse gas and catalyst of stratospheric ozone decline. Polymer-coated fertilizers may be effective in reducing such losses but the appropriate coating thickness for effective field performance is unknown. We prepared urea granules with polyurethane coating (PCU) based on castor oil at 2%-8% by weight. We tested the fertilizer value of these materials for maize (Zea mays L.) and measured field loss of N2O. Maize grain yield and N uptake were similar in treatments fertilized with urea (uncoated) and each of the coated materials. Cumulative N2O-N per unit of grain yield, however, was reduced by 80% with PCU8% compared with uncoated urea. Results indicate that polyurethane-coated urea performs similarly to uncoated urea for maize production while reducing soil N2O emissions up to 60-80%, with an efficiency factor twice as high as that suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for N fertilizers. Our results indicate that urea with a polyurethane coating of 8% (PCU8%) had the best combined agronomic and environmental performance in a field study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Farmyard manure application and associated root proliferation improve the net greenhouse gas balance of Italian ryegrass - Maize double-cropping field in Nasu, Japan. In Japan, most cows are fed indoors, so cow manure must be carefully treated and used to manage soil fertility. The objective of this study was to compare the net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance (NGHGB) of Italian ryegrass - corn (maize) double-cropping fields receiving farmyard manure (FYM), slurry, or methane fermentation digestion liquid (MFDL). FYM, Slurry, MFDL, mineral fertilizer only (Fen.), and no-N control (Cont.) plots were set up in a randomized block design (n = 3). FYM, slurry, or MFDL was applied to meet the K requirement for forage production, and then mineral fertilizers were supplemented to meet the N and P requirements. From September 2017 to September 2020, C inputs as manure and crop residue, heterotrophic respiration (R-H), and emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from soil were determined. The similarity of the total yields in FYM, Slurry, MFDL, and Fert. plots reflected judicious fertility management. However, the residue-C input of Italian ryegrass was 38% greater in FYM plots than in the other plots. Manure-C input decreased in the order of FYM > Slurry > MFDL plots. R-H was greater in FYM and Slurry plots than in MFDL plots. Net ecosystem C balance (NECB) ([residue-C + manure-C] - [R-H-C + CH4-C]) decreased in the order of FYM > Slurry > MFDL plots. N2O emission was greater in Slurry and MFDL plots than in FYM plots. Consequently, NGHGB ([CH4 and N2O emissions] - NECB) in terms of CO2 equivalent decreased in the order of MFDL > Slurry > FYM plots, so FYM application contributed most to GHG mitigation. Yield-scaled NGHGB was smallest in FYM plots owing to the synergy of the greatest residue-C and manure-C inputs, less N2O emission, and the achievement of a high enough yield, reflecting judicious fertility management based on manure and mineral fertilizer.

Long-term no-till and stover retention each decrease the global warming potential of irrigated continuous corn. Over the last 50 years, the most increase in cultivated land area globally has been due to a doubling of irrigated land. Long-term agronomic management impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and global warming potential (GWP) in irrigated systems, however, remain relatively unknown. Here, residue and tillage management effects were quantified by measuring soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes and SOC changes (Delta SOC) at a long-term, irrigated continuous corn (Zea mays L.) system in eastern Nebraska, United States. Management treatments began in 2002, and measured treatments included no or high stover removal (0 or 6.8 Mg DM ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) under no-till (NT) or conventional disk tillage (CT) with full irrigation (n = 4). Soil N2O and CH4 fluxes were measured for five crop-years (2011-2015), and Delta SOC was determined on an equivalent mass basis to similar to 30 cm soil depth. Both area-and yield-scaled soil N2O emissions were greater with stover retention compared to removal and for CT compared to NT, with no interaction between stover and tillage practices. Methane comprised <1% of total emissions, with NT being CH4 neutral and CT a CH4 source. Surface SOC decreased with stover removal and with CT after 14 years of management. When Delta SOC, soil GHG emissions, and agronomic energy usage were used to calculate system GWP, all management systems were net GHG sources. Conservation practices (NT, stover retention) each decreased system GWP compared to conventional practices (CT, stover removal), but pairing conservation practices conferred no additional mitigation benefit. Although cropping system, management equipment/timing/history, soil type, location, weather, and the depth to which Delta SOC is measured affect the GWP outcomes of irrigated systems at large, this long-term irrigated study provides valuable empirical evidence of how management decisions can impact soil GHG emissions and surface SOC stocks.

Integrating organic fertilizers in maize-mung bean intercropping: implications for soil carbon dynamics and greenhouse gas reduction. Organic fertilizers have great potential to improve crop production while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agroecosystems. To study their effect on GHG emissions, a field experiment over a two-year period (2021 and 2022) was carried out to quantify carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Experimental treatments included: (i) two types of organic fertilizers [wheat residue (WR) and sheep manure (SM)]; and (ii) three cropping systems [monocropping of maize (Zea mays L., Ma) and mung bean (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek, Mu), and their intercropping (Ma + Mu)]. Total crop biomass and its carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, soil CO2 and N2O emissions, soil temperature and moisture were measured. The results showed that Ma + Mu_WR significantly reduced cumulative CO2 emissions by 36% and 28% compared to the Ma_WR and Mu_WR, respectively. Similarly, Ma + Mu_SM reduced soil CO2 emissions by 38% and 70% compared to Ma_SM and Mu_SM, respectively. In addition, Ma + Mu_WR had 69% and 71% lower cumulative N2O emissions than Ma_WR and Mu_WR, respectively, while Ma + Mu_SM showed 48% and 55% lower emissions than Ma_SM and Mu_SM, respectively. WR application significantly increased C input and the C input/output. In the Mu, WR fertilizer led to a significant reduction in both C output and total C emitted, whereas in Ma + Mu, these parameters were not affected by the type of organic fertilizers. In Ma, C output was higher under WR than SM, but total C emitted remained unaffected. This study suggests that integrating organic fertilizer into an intercropping system provides a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to effective GHG mitigation.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerdardii Vitman) are potential bioenergy feedstocks. Perennial grasses managed as bioenergy feedstock require nitrogenous inputs, which can cause N2O emission and, thereby, alter their effectiveness to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission.

Big bluestem-clover (Dalea) and switchgrass-clover treatments had dramatically reduced annual N2O emissions and yield-scaled emissions compared with the respective grasses with urea fertilizer. Cumulative N2O emission was 14 to 40% greater in the big bluestem-spring and switchgrass-spring treatments compared with respective autumn-harvested treatments. The average cumulative emission in fertilized big bluestem and switchgrass treatments (18.5 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) exceeded that of the C-S rotation (12.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1)). The emission factor (EF) for fertilized grasses averaged 2.5%, corn averaged 1.05%, and C-S rotation averaged 1.9%. The SOC storage by perennial grasses was limited to 0 to 5 cm and thus may not be adequate to offset N2O emission. Nitrogen management refinement is recommended for herbaceous perennials to optimize biomass production and minimize N2O emission. C1 [Johnson, Jane M.

Effects of rice straw mulching on N2O emissions and maize productivity in a rain-fed upland. In the hilly areas of southern China, uplands and paddies are located adjacent to each other. Using rice straw as mulch for upland soil may improve crop production and partially replace chemical fertilizers, which may mitigate N2O emissions. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the potential of rice straw mulching for mitigating N2O emissions and increasing crop production. The treatments included no mulching (CK), 5000 kg ha(-1) of straw mulching (SM5), and 10,000 kg ha(-1) of straw mulching (SM10). Moreover, all the treatments received equivalent amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium from chemical fertilizers plus rice straw. Relative to CK, cumulative N2O emissions decreased by 23.1 and 33.5% with SM5 and SM10, respectively. Significant positive correlations were observed between N2O fluxes and soil water-filled pore space (WPFS) (r (2) = 0.495, P < 0.05) and between seasonal cumulative N2O fluxes and the chemical N fertilization rate (r (2) = 0.814, P < 0.05). These findings indicate that soil WPFS was the key environmental factor in N2O emissions and that the substitution of chemical nitrogen fertilizer with rice straw was the main driver of N2O mitigation. Relative to CK, the maize yield increased by 16.5 and 29.6% with SM5 and SM10, respectively, which can be attributed primarily to the increases in soil moisture. The chemical fertilizer input could be decreased and N2O emissions could be mitigated through straw mulching, while achieving improved crop yield. This management strategy has great potential, and this study provides an important reference for low-carbon agriculture.

Multi-scale measurements show limited soil greenhouse gas emissions in Kenyan smallholder coffee-dairy systems. Efforts have been made in recent years to improve knowledge about soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from sub-Saharan Africa. However, data on soil GHG emissions from smallholder coffee-dairy systems have not hitherto been measured experimentally. This study aimed to quantify soil GHG emissions at different spatial and temporal scales in smallholder coffee-dairy farms in Murang'a County, Central Kenya. GHG measurements were carried out for one year, comprising two cropping seasons, using vented static chambers and gas chromatography. Sixty rectangular frames were installed on two farms comprising the three main cropping systems found in the area: 1) coffee (Coffea arabica L.); 2) Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum); and 3) maize intercropped with beans (Zea mays and Phaseolus vulgaris). Within these fields, chambers were allocated on fertilised and unfertilised locations to capture spatial variability. Cumulative annual fluxes in coffee plots ranged from 1 to 1.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1), 6.5 to 7.6 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) and (-)3.4 to -2.2 kg CH4 -C ha(-1), with 66% to 94% of annual GHG fluxes occurring during rainy seasons. Across the farm plots, coffee received most of the N inputs and had 56% to 89% higher emissions of N2O than Napier grass, maize and beans. Within farm plots, two to six times higher emissions were found in fertilised hotspots - around the perimeter of coffee trees or within planted maize rows - than in unfertilised locations between trees, rows and planting holes. Background and induced soil N2O emissions from fertiliser and manure applications in the three cropping systems were lower than hypothesized from previous studies and empirical models. This study supplements methods and underlying data for the quantification of GHG emissions at multiple spatial and temporal scales in tropical, smallholder farming systems. Advances towards overcoming the dearth of data will facilitate the understanding of synergies and tradeoffs of climate-smart approaches for low emissions development. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Effects of biochar addition and deficit irrigation with brackish water on yield-scaled N2O emissions under drip irrigation with mulching. Biochar has been proven to have great potential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and improving crop growth. However, the effects of biochar addition on yield-scaled N2O emissions in a mulched and drip-irrigated maize field using different irrigation water qualities and quantities remain unclear. A two-year field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of biochar addition, irrigation level and water salinity on soil N2O emis-sions, maize yield and grain N uptake in Northwest China. Eight treatments in total included the combination of two biochar addition rates of 0 t/ha (B0) and 60 t/ha (B1), two irrigation levels of full (W1) and deficit irrigation (W2, W2 = 1/2 W1) and two water salinity levels of freshwater (S0, 0.71 g/L) and brackish water (S1, 4 g/L). The soil properties, N2O emission fluxes, maize yield and grain N uptake, along with the abundances of N-cycle functional marker genes were measured during the two growing seasons. Soil water-filled pore space (WFPS), soil NH4+-N and NO3--N contents accounted for the majority of the variation in the dynamic changes of N2O fluxes. Deficit irrigation had lower N2O emissions compared with full irrigation, which was more pronounced in the second year. Relative to freshwater irrigation, brackish water irrigation increased N2O emissions under W1, but freshwater and brackish water irrigation had similar N2O emissions under W2 in both years. Biochar addition effectively mitigated N2O emissions by 29.4-31.0% and 17.9-29.2% under different irrigation treatments in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The continuous drought induced by deficit irrigation weakened the effectiveness of biochar in reducing N2O emissions. The differences in N-cycle functional marker genes could not reflect the variation in cumulative N2O emissions among treatments. Under all irrigation treatments excluding W2S1, biochar addition improved the total maize yield and grain N uptake over the two-year period by 4.06-10.74% and 5.57-8.63%, respectively. Brackish water and deficit irrigation increased grain and grain N yield-scaled N2O emissions, whereas biochar addition reduced both of them. Overall, these findings suggest that biochar addition can effectively reduce N2O emissions and increase yield and grain N uptake under brackish water and deficit drip irrigation with mulching in a maize field system, and thus adding biochar can help with achieving the sus-tainability of agricultural production in areas with limited freshwater resources.

GB1032. Nitrous oxide emissions following incorporation of improved-fallow residues in the humid tropics - art. no. GB1032. [1] The rotation of crops with fast-growing tree, shrub, and herbaceous N-2-fixing legume species ( improved fallows) is a central agroforestry technology for soil fertility management in the humid tropics. Maize yields are increased following improved fallows compared with continuous maize cropping or traditional natural-fallow systems consisting of broadleaved weeds and grasses. However, the effect of these improved-fallow systems on N availability and N2O emissions following residue application has yet to be determined. Emissions from these systems not only have a detrimental effect on the environment, but are of additional concern in that they represent a potentially significant loss of N and a reduction in N-use efficiency. Emissions of N2O were measured from improved-fallow agroforestry systems in western Kenya, being characteristic of agroforestry systems in the humid tropics. Emissions were increased after incorporation of fallow residues and were higher after incorporation of improved-fallow legume residues (Sesbania sesban, Crotalaria grahamiana, Macroptilium atropurpureum) than natural-fallow residues ( mainly consisting of Digitaria abyssibica, Habiscus cannabinus, Bidens pilosa, Guizotia scabra, Leonotis nepetifolia, Commelina benghalensis). Following incorporation of Sesbania and Macroptilium residues (7.4 t dry matter ha(-1); 2.9% N) in a mixed fallow system, 4.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1) was emitted over 84 days. The percentages of N applied emitted as N2O following residue incorporation in these tropical agroforestry systems were of the same magnitude as in temperate agricultural systems. N2O (log(e)) emissions were positively correlated with residue N content (r = 0.93; P < 0.05), and thus the residue composition, particularly its N content, is an important consideration when proposing management practices to mitigate N2O emissions from these systems.

Renovation and conversion of permanent grass-clover swards to pasture or crops: Effects on annual N2O emissions in the year after ploughing. The need for improved herbage yield and forage quality, on intensively managed grassland, in dairy fanning systems, often results in land being brought into tillage, either by grassland reseeding or conversion to arable cropping (particularly maize (Zea mays L,) for silage). However, both options are likely to increase the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) after grassland cultivation, particularly when this involves ploughing, although there is limited information about the level of emissions. In order to estimate whether the time of ploughing and type of forage crop would affect the annual emissions of the important GHG nitrous oxide (N2O) in the year after soil disturbance of grassland, a field experiment was established on a Eutric Luvisol in northern Germany. The three factorial experiment comprised the effect of land use management (four treatments: ploughing and reseeding in autumn; ploughing and reseeding in spring, ploughing and conversion to maize in spring; control treatment of intact permanent grassland); the effect of nitrogen (N) fertilizer input (two treatments: 0 and 240 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) applied as cattle slurry); and the experimental year (two years). Treatments were arranged with three replicates in a randomized block design. N2O emissions were measured on a weekly basis with the static chamber method and N drainage during winter was estimated using suction cups. Thus, direct and indirect N2O emissions (via N leaching) were calculated per ha as well as per unit of forage yield. Results showed that ground-frost and freeze-thaw cycles were major drivers of enhanced N2O fluxes during the winter following ploughing and reseeding of grassland in autumn, resulting in the highest direct emissions of 21.31 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1). Emissions following, grassland ploughing in spring were mainly driven by high soil mineral N concentrations but with maximum figures of 3.90 and 6.32 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) after reseeding and conversion to maize respectively. Emissions in the intact permanent grassland were lowest in both years. Forage yield related emissions were also highest for grassland ploughing and reseeding in autumn and lowest for intact permanent grassland, but with no significant differences for reseeding and maize cultivation after grassland ploughing in spring. Application of slurry increased annual N2O emissions, particularly when applied in the year of reseeding, but with a lower calculated emission factor as advised by the IPCC guidelines for N fertilizers. We conclude that sustaining highly productive permanent grass-clover swards with moderate N fertilization and without tillage is the best option for 'climate-smart forage production' followed, when unavoidable, by tillage operations only in early spring for direct grassland reseeding, or delayed reseeding using a high yielding forage crop like maize.

Agricultural soils a trigger to nitrous oxide: a persuasive greenhouse gas and its management. Agricultural soils form the backbone of the country's economic development. The increased population has not only reduced this treasure but also has affected the global climate at an alarming rate. Among the GHGs, emission of N2O due to agricultural activities is nowadays a global concern. Agricultural industries have increased N2O and CH(4)by 17% in the atmosphere since 1990, with an average emanation rate of around 60 MT CO(2)equivalents per year. Crop production accounts for approximately 50% of N2O emissions stemming from the farming community and discharges of fertilizer-induced N2O, for the time being estimated by IPCC at 1.24% of the N used ranging from 0.76% (rice) to 2.77% (maize). The concentration of atmospheric N2O has increased (60 ppb) after the industrial revolution, at the pace of 0.73 ppb year(-1). Besides, soil structure, temperature, moisture, denitrifying microbial population, pH, C:N ratio, and relief are the factors which significantly enhance the N2O levels into the atmosphere. N2O as a GHG has more potential towards global warming than CO(2)and has a very long residence period (115 years) in the atmosphere. N2O emission is nowadays a core issue which needs to be mitigated so as to decline the levels of its production in agricultural soils. However, priority should be given to the organic farming, management of soil chemistry, and phytoremediation to reduce the addition of N2O into the ambient air. Furthermore, deployment of N2O reductase in agricultural soils increases the efficiency of converting N2O to inert N(2)which is a valuable strategy to reduce N2O production.

Contrasting effects of straw and straw-derived biochar application on net global warming potential in the Loess Plateau of China. Knowledge about the impacts of the application of organic amendments such as straw and biochar to dryland agricultural soils with respect to soil properties, crop production, soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gases emissions is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of straw and straw:derived biochar amendments on soil properties, net global warming potential (NGWP) and net greenhouse gas intensity (NGHGI). A field experiment extending over two years was conducted involving simultaneous measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil organic carbon (SOC) content in a wheat-maize crop rotation on the Loess Plateau of China. There were five treatments: control with no amendment (CK); conventional chemical fertilizer only (F); 8 t ha(-1) wheat straw plus fertilizer (FS); 8 t ha(-1) straw derived biochar plus fertilizer (FBlow); and 16 t ha(-1) straw derived biochar plus fertilizer (FBhigh). SOC, C:N ratio and high active organic carbon (HAC) increased by 26.4%, 30.8% and 17.1%, respectively in the FBhigh treatment relative to the FS treatment. As compared to the F treatment, addition of straw significantly increased the total soil organic carbon sequestration rate (TSOCSR) in the soil depth of 0-100 cm and CO2 emissions, but had no significant effect on soil N2O and CH4 emissions or crop yield. However, straw-derived biochar amendment significantly decreased N2O emissions while significantly increasing (p <0.05) crop yield and TSOCSR, but there was no effect on soil CO2 emissions. Over all, our result showed an overall reduction in NGWP of 37.8% and 31.5% and in NGHGI of 28.1% and 21.2% under straw derived biochar amendment at 8 t ha(-1) and 16 t ha(-1), respectively as compared to the straw amendment. Thus, amending the soil with straw-derived biochar could provide a mechanism to lower the greenhouse gas intensity while increasing the productivity of wheat and maize cropping system in the Loess Plateau of China.

Nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions from maize after grass-clover on a coarse sandy soil: Mitigation potentials of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Cropping of maize (Zea mays L.) on sandy soil in wet climates involves a significant risk for nitrogen (N) losses, since nitrate added in fertilizers or produced from residues and manure may be lost outside the period with active crop N uptake. This one-year lysimeter experiment investigated the potential of Vizura (R), a formulation for liquid manure (slurry) with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3-) leaching from a coarse sandy soil cropped with maize. Maize followed grass-clover (Lolium perenne L.-Trifolium pratense L.) with spring incorporation and was fertilised with cattle slurry. A total of 12 treatments in triplicate were included in a factorial experiment with 1 m(2) large and 1.4 m deep lysimeters: 1) with or without spraying the above-ground biomass of grass-clover with DMPP before incorporation; 2) application of cattle manure with or without DMPP, or no fertilization; and 3) natural rainfall or extra rain events to represent wet spring conditions, which were simulated with an automated and programmable irrigation system. Around 20 kg N ha(-1) was returned to the soil in grass-clover above-ground biomass, and 145 kg N ha(-1) in cattle manure. Cumulative annual N2O emissions ranged from 0.4 to 1.3 kg N ha(-1), with between 49 and 86% of emissions occurring during spring, Manure application increased N2O emissions, while extra rainfall had no effect. The mitigation of N2O emissions by DMPP ranged from 46 to 67% under natural, and from 44 to 48% under high rainfall conditions. Total annual NO3- leaching ranged from 65 to 162 kg N ha(-1). The extent of NO3- leaching to 1.4 m depth during spring was low, and instead most (72-83%) of total annual NO3--N leaching was recorded during autumn before harvest. The extra rainfall during spring increased NO3--N leaching in the pre-harvest period, but it is not clear to what extent this was associated with the N in grass-clover residues or manure applied in spring, or from N mineralisation below the root zone. Despite evidence for a reduction of NO3- leaching in three of four scenarios, overall this effect was not significant. No DMPP was detected in leachates. In conclusion, DMPP significantly reduced N2O emissions from cattle manure on this sandy loam soil independent of rainfall, while there was no significant effect on NO3- leaching. The results indicate that N2O emissions and NO3--N leaching were partly derived from below-ground sources of N not affected by DMPP, which should be further investigated to better predict the mitigation potential of nitrification inhibitors.

Fluxes of nitrous oxide and molecular nitrogen from irrigated soils of Catalonia (Spain). Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a gas of environmental concern that can be emitted during nitrification and denitrification. Molecular nitrogen (N-2) is the ultimate product of denitrification. The emission of both gases represents an economic loss. This study quantified daily and seasonal N2O and N-2 emissions from three benchmark arable soils sown with maize (Zea mays L.) in Catalonia (northeast Spain) during the irrigation season, and identified the major factors and processes determining these emissions. The N2O was sampled using the closed chamber method, and N-2 from N2O that accumulated with the acetylene inhibition method, simultaneously in the field. At mater-filled pore space (WFPS) >70%, losses amounted to 389 g of N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) from the El Pinell site, 144 g of N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) from the Barbens site, and 125 g of N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) from the Bellpuig site. Most of the N was lost through complete denitrification. Up to 640 g of N-2-N ha(-1) d(-1) were lost from the El Pinell site, 1438 g of N-2-N ha(-1) d(-1) from the Barbens site, and 233 g of N-2-N ha(-1) d(-1) from the Bellpuig site. Negative N2O and N-2 fluxes were found. Total (N2O + N-2)-N losses represent 13.6% of the N applied at the El Pinell site, 8.6% at the Barbens site, and 1.7% at the Bellpuig site. Denitrification was the main source of emission. Significant N2O-N losses due to nitrification were also measured. The potential for gaseous N losses from these soils at <40% WFPS is low (it averaged 0.01 g of N ha(-1) d(-1) from the three sites). C1 Univ Ghent, Fac Agr & Appl Biol Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.

Effects of tillage practice on soil structure, N2O emissions and economics in cereal production under current socio-economic conditions in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. Conservation tillage is expected to have a positive effect on soil physical properties, soil Carbon (C) storage, while reducing fuel, labour and machinery costs. However, reduced tillage could increase soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and offset the expected gains from increased C sequestration. To date, conservation tillage is barely practiced or studied in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH). Here, we report a field study on the short-term effects of reduced (RT) and no tillage (NT) on N2O emission dynamics, yield-scaled N2O emissions, soil structure and the economics of cereal production, as compared with conventional tillage (CT). The field experiment was conducted in the Sarajevo region on a clayey loam under typical climatic conditions for humid, continental BH. N2O emissions were monitored in a Maize-Barley rotation over two cropping seasons. Soil structure was studied at the end of the second season. In the much wetter 2014, N2O emission were in the order of CT > RT > NT, while in the drier 2015, the order was RT > CT > NT. The emission factors were within or slightly above the uncertainty range of the IPCC Tier 1 factor, if taking account for the N input from the cover crop (alfalfa) preceding the first experimental year. Saturated soils in spring, formation of soil crusts and occasional droughts adversely affected yields, particularly in the second year (barley). In 2014, yield-scaled N2O emissions ranged from 83.2 to 161.7 g N Mg-1 grain (corn) but were much greater in the second year due to crop failure (barley). RT had the smallest yield-scaled N2O emission in both years. NT resulted in economically inacceptable returns, due to the increased costs of weed control and low yields in both years. The reduced number of operations in RT reduced production costs and generated positive net returns. Therefore, RT could potentially provide agronomic and environmental benefits in crop production in BH.

Impacts of 49-51 years of fertilization and crop rotation on growing season nitrous oxide emissions, nitrogen uptake and corn yields. A field study was established in 1959 to evaluate the effects of fertilization and crop rotation on crop yields, soil and environmental quality on a Brookston clay loam. There were two fertilizer treatments (fertilized and not-fertilized) and six cropping treatments including continuous corn (CC), continuous Kentucky bluegrass sod and a 4-yr rotation of corn-oat-alfalfa-alfalfa with each phase present each year. We measured N2O emissions, inorganic N and plant N uptake over three growing seasons (2007-2009) in the corn phase. Nitrous oxide emissions varied over the 3 yr as a result of the seasonal variation in precipitation quantity, intensity and timing and differences in crop growth and N uptake. Fertilized CC lost, on average, 7.36 kg N ha(-1) by N2O emissions, whereas the not-fertilized CC lost only 0.51 kg N ha(-1). Fertilized rotation corn (RC) lost 6.46 kg N ha(-1), which was 12% lower than fertilized CC. The not-fertilized RC, on the other hand, emitted about half as much N2O (2.95 kg N ha(-1)) as the fertilized RC. Fertilized RC had corn grain yields that averaged 10.0 t ha(-1) over the 3 yr followed by fertilized CC at 5.48 t ha(-1). Not-fertilized RC corn had yields that were 61% lower (3.93 t ha(-1)) than fertilized RC, whereas the not-fertilized CC had yields that were 75% lower (1.39 t ha(-1)) than fertilized CC. Nitrous oxide emissions were found to be dramatically affected by long-term management practices and crop rotation had lower emissions in the corn phase of the rotation even though the N input from fertilizer addition and legume N fixation was greater. These N2O emission and yield results were due to both factors that are traditionally used to describe these processes as well as long-term soil quality factors, which were created by the long-term management (i.e., soil organic carbon, soil physical parameters such as bulk density, and porosity, soil fauna and microflora) and that influenced crop growth, N uptake and soil water contents.

Long-term measurements of N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was measured weekly over a period of one year (1994) on a grassland, a maize field and a permanent pasture. Therefore, the closed box method was used. To estimate the total (N2O+N-2) loss, also soil cores were taken for incubation in the presence of acetylene. N2O fluxes were highest in the grazed grassland (11.9 kg N.(-1).435 day(-1)) because of the high nitrogen input (fertilization, deposition of urine and dung by cattle), a higher soil compaction and relatively high moisture content. N2O losses out of the temporary grassland (3.35 kg N.ha(-1).312 day(-1)) and maize field (2.7 kg N.ha(-1).312 days(-1)) were significantly lower. This is attributed to a lower N input and the fact that these 2 fields were very well managed (controlled fertilization, good drainage system, lower compaction,...). From an agronomic point of view, N-losses as N2O are small and not important to take into consideration. Besides, these small N2O fluxes can have a negative influence on the environment.

The influence of straw returning on N2O emissions from a maize-wheat field in the North China Plain. Crop straw returning has become a prevailing cultivation practice in the vast area of the North China Plain (NCP), while few investigations about its influence on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission have been conducted, In this study, N2O emissions from an agricultural field in the NCP with and without straw returning were comparably investigated by using static chambers in two consecutive maize-wheat growing seasons from June 2010 to June 2012. Compared with the NP treatment (compound nitrogen fertilizer only), the cumulative N2O emission from the SP treatment (compound nitrogen fertilizer plus straw) increased about 150% during the maize season in 2010, but decreased by about 35% during the maize season in 2011. The inconsistent influence of straw returning on N2O emission from the maize field was ascribed to the evidently different soil moisture between the two years, which was further confirmed by laboratory simulation experiments. About 40% reduction of N2O emission from the SP treatment during the two winter wheat seasons, which was mainly attributed to anoxic condition induced by rotting the maize straw.

N2O emission and yield-scaled N2O emission (N2O emission per unit N uptake by grain and aboveground biomass) to different N fertilizer rates in a winter wheat-summer corn double-cropping system in the North China Plain. Soil N2O emission measurements were carried out for two years in a long-term field experiment, under semi-arid conditions with four flood irrigations events per year. Our results indicated that N2O emissions were linear functions and yield-scaled N2O emissions were cubic functions of N fertilizer application rate. Yield-scaled N2O emissions were lowest at application rates of 136 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Using a quadratic-plateau model, it was found that maximal crop yields were achieved at an application rate of 317 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), which is 20% less than current practice. This level is suggested to be a compromise between achieving food security and mitigation N2O emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Impact of urease and nitrification inhibitors on nitrous oxide emissions from fluvo-aquic soil in the North China Plain. Little information is available on the effects of urease inhibitor, N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), and nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from fluvo-aquic soil in the North China Plain. A field experiment was conducted at the Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station, Henan Province, China, to study the influence of urea added with NBPT, DCD, and combination of both NBPT and DCD on N2O emissions during the maize growing season in 2009. Two peaks of N2O fluxes occurred during the maize growing season: the small one following irrigation and the big one after nitrogen (N) fertilizer application. There was a significant positive relationship between In [N2O flux] and soil moisture during the maize growing season excluding the 11-day datasets after N fertilizer application, indicating that N2O flux was affected by soil moisture. Mean N2O flux was the highest in the control with urea alone, while the application of urea together with NBPT, DCD, and NBPT + DCD significantly lowered the mean N2O flux. Total N2O emission in the NBPT + DCD, DCD, NBPT, and urea alone treatments during the experimental period was 0.41, 0.47, 0.48, and 0.77 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively. Application of urea with NBPT, DCD, and NBPT + DCD reduced N2O emission by 37.7%, 39.0%, and 46.8%, respectively, over urea alone. Based on our findings, the combination of DCD and NBPT together with urea may reduce N2O emission and improve the maize yield from fluvo-aquic soil in the North China Plain.

Nitrous Oxide Emissions Increase Exponentially When Optimum Nitrogen Fertilizer Rates Are Exceeded in the North China Plain. The IPCC assume a linear relationship between nitrogen (N) application rate and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in inventory reporting, however, a growing number of studies show a nonlinear relationship under specific soil-climatic conditions. In the North China plain, a global hotspot of N2O emissions, covering a land as large as Germany, the correlation between N rate and N2O emissions remains unclear. We have therefore specifically investigated the N2O response to N applications by conducting field experiments with five N rates, and high-frequency measurements of N2O emissions across contrasting climatic years. Our results showed that cumulative and yield-scaled N2O emissions both increased exponentially as N applications were raised above the optimum rate in maize (Zea mays L.). In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) there was a corresponding quadratic increase in N2O emissions with the magnitude of the response in 2012-2013 distinctly larger than that in 2013-2014 owing to the effects of extreme snowfall. Existing empirical models (including the IPCC approach) of the N2O response to N rate have overestimated N2O emissions in the North China plain, even at high N rates. Our study therefore provides a new and robust analysis of the effects of fertilizer rate and climatic conditions on N2O emissions.

Effects of different irrigation methods on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in winter wheat field are poorly understood. In this study, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were investigated in winter wheat field irrigated with surface drip irrigation (SDI), sprinkler irrigation (SI) and flood irrigation (CK) from 1 April to 31 May of 2014 in the North China Plain.

IWUE and yield of winter wheat in SI was greater than that in CK by 28.2% and 8.5%, respectively. These combined results indicated that SDI may not only guarantee yield stability, but also mitigate GHG (CH4 and N2O) emissions and improve IWUE. Therefore, more attention should be paid to apply SDI in winter wheat field in the North China Plain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

IPCC Emission Factor Overestimates N2O Emissions from Agricultural Ditches. Agricultural ditches emit disproportionate amounts of nitrous oxide (N2O), but their contributions to regional or global N2O emissions remain unclear due to limited data. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends using emission factors (EFs) to estimate indirect N2O emission, but the EF for ditches (EF5g) is categorized as groundwater, which potentially introduces a significant bias. This study conducted a regional-scale campaign in the North China Plain, one of the world's most intensive agricultural regions, and calculated the EF5g values from agricultural ditches by the concentration method (N2O-N/NO3 --N). The results found that the regional-scale mean EF5g value (0.0028) was less than half of the IPCC default value (0.006), illustrating that the current IPCC methodology significantly overestimates N2O emissions from agricultural ditches. Despite the relatively small EF5g values, agricultural ditches exhibited a high mean N2O concentration (3.36 mu g L-1) and a large regional emission (1.14 +/- 0.86 Gg N2O-N yr-1), which is equal to 3.8 +/- 2.9% of direct N2O emission from the croplands in the North China Plain. Since ditches are ubiquitous in agricultural regions and are likely to expand under climate change, refining EF5g is crucial to accurately assess their contribution to global N2O budgets.

Response of CH4 and N2O Emissions and Wheat Yields to Tillage Method Changes in the North China Plain. The objective of this study was to quantify soil methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions when converting from minimum and no-tillage systems to subsoiling (tilled soil to a depth of 40 cm to 45 cm) in the North China Plain. The relationships between CH4 and N2O flux and soil temperature, moisture, NH4+-N, organic carbon (SOC) and pH were investigated over 18 months using a split-plot design. The soil absorption of CH4 appeared to increase after conversion from no-tillage (NT) to subsoiling (NTS), from harrow tillage (HT) to subsoiling (HTS) and from rotary tillage (RT) to subsoiling (RTS). N2O emissions also increased after conversion. Furthermore, after conversion to subsoiling, the combined global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 and N2O increased by approximately 0.05 kg CO2 ha(-1) for HTS, 0.02 kg CO2 ha(-1) for RTS and 0.23 kg CO2 ha(-1) for NTS. Soil temperature, moisture, SOC, NH4+-N and pH also changed after conversion to subsoiling. These changes were correlated with CH4 uptake and N2O emissions. However, there was no significant correlation between N2O emissions and soil temperature in this study. The grain yields of wheat improved after conversion to subsoiling. Under HTS, RTS and NTS, the average grain yield was elevated by approximately 42.5%, 27.8% and 60.3% respectively. Our findings indicate that RTS and HTS would be ideal rotation tillage systems to balance GWP decreases and grain yield improvements in the North China Plain region.

Nitrous oxide emissions from a maize field during two consecutive growing seasons in the North China Plain. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a maize field in the North China Plain (Wangdu County, Hebei Province, China) were investigated using static chambers during two consecutive maize growing seasons in the 2008 and 2009. The N2O pulse emissions occurred with duration of about 10 days after basal and additional fertilizer applications in the both years. The average N2O fluxes from the CK (control plot, without crop, fertilization and irrigation), NP (chemical N fertilizer), SN (wheat straw returning plus chemical N fertilizer), OM-1/2N (chicken manure plus half chemical N fertilizer) and OMN (chicken manure plus chemical N fertilizer) plots in 2008 were 8.51, 72.1, 76.6, 101, 107 ng N/(m(2).sec), respectively, and in 2009 were 33.7, 30.0 and 35.0 ng N/(m(2).sec) from CK, NP and SN plots, respectively. The emission factors of the applied fertilizer as N2O-N (EFs) were 3.8% (2008) and 1.1% (2009) for the NP plot, 3.2% (2008) and 1.2% (2009) for the SN plot, and 2.8% and 2.2% in 2008 for the OM-1/2N and OMN plots, respectively. Hydromorphic properties of the investigated soil (with gley) are in favor of denitrification. The large differences of the soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) between the two maize seasons were suspected to be responsible for the significant yearly variations. Compared with the treatments of NP and SN, chicken manure coupled with compound fertilizer application significantly reduced fertilizer loss rate as N2O-N.

Soil Nitrous Oxide Emissions Under Maize-Legume Intercropping System in the North China Plain. Many studies have focused on various agricultural management measures to reduce agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. However, few studies have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems in the North China Plain. Thus, we conducted a field experiment to compare N2O emissions under monoculture and maize-legume intercropping systems. In 2010, five treatments, including monocultured maize (M), maize-peanut (MP), maize-alfalfa (MA), maize-soybean (MS), and maize-sweet clover (MSC) intercropping were designed to investigate this issue using the static chamber technique. In 2011, M, MP, and MS remained, and monocultured peanuts (P) and soybean (S) were added to the trial. The results showed that total production of N2O from different treatments ranged from (0.87 +/- 0.12) to (1.17 +/- 0.11) kg ha(-1) in 2010, while those ranged from (3.35 +/- 0.30) to (9.10 +/- 2.09) kg ha(-1) in 2011. MA and MSC had no significant effect on soil N2O production compared to that of M (P<0.05). Cumulative N2O emissions from MP in 2010 were significantly lower than those from M, but the result was the opposite in 2011 (P<0.05). MS significantly reduced soil N2O emissions by 25.55 and 48.84% in 2010 and 2011, respectively (P<0.05). Soil N2O emissions were significantly correlated with soil water content, soil temperature, nitrification potential, soil NH4+, and soil NO3- content (R-2=0.160-0.764, P<0.01). A stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that soil N2O release was mainly controlled by the interaction between soil moisture and soil NO3- content (R-2=0.828, P<0.001). These results indicate that MS had a coincident effect on soil N2O flux and significantly reduced soil N2O production compared to that of M over two growing seasons.

Potential dual effect of nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate on nitrifier denitrification in the mitigation of peak N2O emission events in North China Plain cropping systems. The winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain is a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to high nitrogen (N) fertilizer and irrigation water inputs. However, a detailed understanding of the contribution of N2O production sources is still limited because of the complexity of N2O generation in soils and a lack of relevant field studies. Moreover, the efficiency and mechanisms of N2O mitigation approaches in this area, i.e. the use of nitrification inhibitors, remains poorly understood. To elucidate the N2O production pathways from this rotation system and to evaluate the effect of a widely used nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on mitigating N2O emissions, we monitored N2O fluxes and analyzed isotopomer ratios of soil-emitted N2O during one rotation year. Results indicate that the application of DMPP significantly reduced N2O emissions by 67% in the winter wheat season and 47% in the summer maize season. Isotopomer analysis revealed that in the N-fertilized treatment, nitrification and/or fungal denitrification accounted for up to 36% of the N2O emission peaks observed after fertilization and irrigation events, whereas the nitrifier denitrification pathway was likely to be the major source, accounting for the remaining N2O emissions. The high effectiveness of the nitrification inhibitor on mitigating N2O emissions at high soil moisture may be attributed to the dual inhibitory effect on nitrifier denitrification, i.e. reducing the supply of nitrite, which is the substrate of nitrifier denitrification and inhibiting ammonia-oxidizing bacteria activities, which carry nitrifier denitrification.

Greenhouse gas emissions from soil under maize-soybean intercrop in the North China Plain. Intercrop systems can exhibit unique soil properties compared to monocultures, which influences the microbially-mediated processes leading to greenhouse gas emissions. Fertilized intercrops and monocultures produce different amounts of N2O, CO2 and CH4 depending on their nutrient and water use efficiencies. The objective of this study was to compare the fluxes and seasonal emissions of N2O, CO2, and CH4 from a maize-soybean intercrop compared to maize and soybean monocultures, in relation to crop effects on soil properties. The experiment was conducted during 2012, 2013 and 2014 at the WuQiao Experimental Station in the North China Plain. All cropping systems received urea-N fertilizer (240 kg N ha(-1) applied in two split applications). The cropping systems were a net source of CO2 and a net sink of CH4, with significantly (P < 0.05 in 2012) and numerically (2013 and 2014) lower N2O flux and smaller seasonal N2O emissions from the maize-soybean intercrop than the maize monoculture. The proportion of urea-N lost as N2O was lower in the maize-soybean intercrop (1.6% during the 3-year study) and soybean monoculture (1.7%), compared to maize monoculture (2.3%). Soybean reduced the soil NO3 (-)-N concentration and created a cooler, drier environment that was less favorable for denitrification, although we cannot rule out the possibility of N2O reduction to N-2 and other N compounds by soybean and its associated N-2-fixing prokaryotes. We conclude that maize-soybean intercrop has potential to reduce N2O emissions in fertilized agroecosystems and should be considered in developing climate-smart cropping systems in the North China Plain.

Nitrous oxide emissions and soil profile responses to manure substitution in the North China Plain drylands. Substituting synthetic fertilizers with manures in agriculture enhances soil properties and crop yield. However, the impact on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, especially from the soil profile, remains poorly understood. This study examined emissions from 2017 to 2019 on a well-established (>10-year) maize field site in the North China Plain. Three treatments were compared: 100 % synthetic nitrogen (NPK), 50 % synthetic fertilizer N + 50 % manure N substitution (50%MNS), and 100 % manure N substitution (100%MNS). N2O emissions were monitored for three years, and in 2019, N2O concentrations at 20 cm and 40 cm soil depths were analyzed in relation to surface N2O fluxes and environmental factors. The results showed manure substitution resulted in about 13.8 %-25.2 % (50%MNS) and 40.3 %-72.2 % (100%MNS) reduction in N2O emissions over the 3-year period compared with the NPK treatment. Throughout the maize growing season, the top-dressing accompanied by rainfall was responsible for the N2O emissions. The difference in N2O concentrations between all the treatments at 20 cm depth was insignificant, but at 40 cm depth the N2O concentrations were significantly higher for the 50%MNS treatment than the other treatments. The N2O fluxes and N2O concentration were not synchronized especially in NPK. The decoupled relationship between the N2O fluxes and the N2O concentration in the soil profile depth suggested the contribution of N2O produced in the soil profile to the surface N2O fluxes is limited. This study highlights that manure substitution is an efficient measure to reduce N2O emissions.

Effects of white-rot fungal pretreatment of corn straw return on greenhouse gas emissions from the North China Plain soil. Straw-return with fungal treatment is a potential method for reducing soil greenhouse gas emissions through carbon (C) sequestration and N2O mitigation. However, there is little information on the effects of different fungal treatments of crop straw return on soil CO2 and N2O emissions. To explore to what extent decomposed corn straw and its components controls soil CO2 and N2O emissions, we set up three sequential incubation experiments using soil collected from the North China Plain, an intensive agricultural area. Interactions between the different C contents of corn straw (CS), CS pretreated with Irpex lacteus (ICS), CS pretreated with Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PCS) and different NO3--N concentrations on the effect of soil CO2 and N2O emissions were conducted, and the kinetics of CO2 and N2O as influenced by changes in soil biochemical factors were analyzed. The effects of different lignocellulose components (lignin, cellulose, and xylan) on soil CO2 and N2O emissions were further studied. The results showed that straw pretreatment did not affect CO2 emissions. Both CO2 and N2O emissions increased when the C and N contents increased. However, applying PCS to 70% water -filled pore space soil effectively decreased the soil N2O emissions, by 41.8%-76.3% compared with adding the same level of CS. Moreover, extracellular enzyme activities related to C and N cycling were triggered, and the nosZI and nosZII abundances were significantly stimulated by the PCS application. These effects are closely related to the initial soluble C content of this treatment. Furthermore, adding xylan can significantly reduce N2O emissions. Overall, our data suggest that the environmentally beneficial effects of returning straw can be greatly enhanced by applying the straw-degrading white-rot fungi of P. chrysosporium in the North China Plain soil. Future studies are needed in the field to upscale this technology. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Soil properties drive nitrous oxide accumulation patterns by shaping denitrifying bacteriomes. In agroecosystems, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are influenced by both microbiome composition and soil properties, yet the relative importance of these factors in determining differential N2O emissions remains unclear. This study investigates the impacts of these factors on N2O emissions using two primary agricultural soils from northern China: fluvo-aquic soil (FS) from the North China Plain and black soil (BS) from Northeast China, which exhibit significant differences in physicochemical properties. In non-sterilized controls (NSC), we observed distinct denitrifying bacterial phenotypes between FS and BS, with BS exhibiting significantly higher N2O emissions. Cross-inoculation experiments were conducted by introducing extracted microbiomes into sterile recipient soils of both types to disentangle the relative contributions of soil properties and microbiomes on N2O emission potential. The results showed recipient-soil-dependent gas kinetics, with significantly higher N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratios in BS compared to FS, regardless of the inoculum type. Metagenomic analysis further revealed significant shifts in denitrification genes and microbial diversity of the inoculated bacteriomes influenced by the recipient soil. The higher ratios of nirS/nosZ in FS and nirK/nosZ in BS indicated that the recipient soil dictates the formation of different denitrifying guilds. Specifically, the BS environment fosters nirK-based denitrifiers like Rhodanobacter, contributing to higher N2O accumulation, while FS supports a diverse array of denitrifiers, including Pseudomonas and Stutzerimonas, associated with complete denitrification and lower N2O emissions. This study underscores the critical role of soil properties in shaping microbial community dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions. These findings highlight the importance of considering soil physicochemical properties in managing agricultural practices to mitigate N2O emissions.

Deceleration of Cropland-N2O Emissions in China and Future Mitigation Potentials. Agricultural soils are the largest anthropogenic emission source of nitrous oxide (N2O). National agricultural policies have been implemented to increase crop yield and reduce nitrogen (N) losses to the environment. However, it is difficult to effectively quantify crop-specific and regional N2O mitigation priorities driven by policies, due to lack of long-term, high-resolution crop-specific activity data, and oversimplified models. Here, we quantify the spatiotemporal changes and key drivers of crop-specific cropland-N2O emissions from China between 1980 and 2017, and future N2O mitigation potentials, using a linear mixed-effect model and survey-based data set of agricultural management measures. Cropland-N2O emissions from China tripled from 102.5 to 315.0 Gg N yr(-1) between 1980 and 2017, and decelerated since 1998 mainly driven by country-wide deceleration and decrease in N rate and the changes in sowing structure. About 63% of N2O emissions could be reduced in 2050, primarily in the North China Plain and Northeast China Plain; 83% of which is from the production of maize (33%), vegetables (27%), and fruits (23%). The deceleration of N2O emissions highlights that policy interventions and agronomy practices (i.e., optimizing N rate and sowing structure) are potential pathways for further ambitious N2O mitigation in China and other developing countries.

Nitrous oxide emissions from cultivated soils in the North China Plain. Using an enclosed chamber technique, N2O emissions from intensively cultivated soils in the North China Plain were measured during periods fi om October 1995 to September 1996 and June 1997 to June 1998, to reflect distinct contributions of the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons. The results show that the measured annual mean emission of N2O from soils treated with chemical N Fertilizer and from soils treated with chemical N fertilizer combined with organic manure were 52.8 and 61.4 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. These emissions from fertilized soils were significantly higher right after the chemical fertilizer was applied. A relatively low annual mean emission of 2.2 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1) was measured in soils that had not been Fertilized for 12 years. Maximal annual emissions of N2O from the studied agroecosystem were 3.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1). The results indicate that the application of organic manure also had a significant effect on N2O emissions, which combined with the use of chemical N fertilizer increased about 20% over the whole year. A weak correlation was found between N2O emissions and soil available NH4+ N content. Average annual N2O emission from fertilized soils was estimated to be 57.1 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1), which is in good agreement with the average emission of 52.7 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1) reported in other fertilized soil Bur studies at different locations in China.

Turnover of Urea in a Soil from the North China Plain as Affected by the Urease Inhibitor NBPT and Wheat Straw. In the North China Plain (NCP), urea is applied to predominantly high-pH soils and high gaseous losses of N are observed in the forms of ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The production of N2O and N-2 is further stimulated by the addition of fresh organic materials. The urease inhibitor (UI) N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) restricts the loss of N by reducing the rate of urea hydrolysis and limiting the substrates for NH3 and N2O emission. We investigated the turnover of N-as well as the emissions of NH3, N2O and CO2-as affected by the addition of wheat straw and urea +NBPT in an incubation experiment using soil from a farmer's field, typical for the NCP. Added wheat straw prolonged the persistence of NH4+ after the application of both urea and urea +NBPT, while reducing the formation of nitrate. Wheat straw may therefore either act as a stimulant of hydrolysis or as an inhibitor of nitrification. Urea increased soil respiration and the emission of N2O, possibly acting as a primer for microbial activity as described in earlier studies. In combination with the application of organic C sources, this effect of urea may be a main driver of gaseous N loss.

Evaluation of the DNDC Model to Estimate Soil Parameters, Crop Yield and Nitrous Oxide Emissions for Alternative Long-Term Multi-Cropping Systems in the North China Plain. Optimizing crop rotations is one of the proposed sustainable management strategies for increasing carbon sequestration. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model for estimating soil parameters (temperature, moisture and exchangeable NO3- and NH4+), crop yield and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions for long-term multi-cropping systems in Hebei, China. The model was validated using five years of data of soil parameters, crop yields and N2O emissions. The DNDC model effectively simulated daily soil temperature, cumulative soil nitrogen and crop yields of all crops. It predicted the trends of observed daily N2O emissions and their cumulative values well but overestimated the magnitude of some peaks. However, the model underestimated daily water filled pore space, especially in dry seasons, and had difficulties in correctly estimating daily exchangeable NO3- and NH4+. Both observed and simulated cumulative N2O results showed that optimized and alternative cropping systems used less nitrogen fertiliser, increased grain yield and decreased N2O emissions compared to the conventional cropping system. Our study shows that although the DNDC model (v. 9.5) is not perfect in estimating daily N2O emissions for these long-term multi-cropping systems, it could still be an effective tool for predicting cumulative emissions.

Enhanced nitrous oxide emissions caused by atmospheric nitrogen deposition in agroecosystems over China. Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in China has been the largest worldwide. Yet the impacts of atmospheric N deposition on soil N2O emissions were often ignored by previous studies. Thus, we investigated how N deposition affected N2O emissions over China using the process-based model (DNDC, DeNitrification-DeComposition). Total soil N inputs were 194 kg N ha(-1) in agricultural systems over China in 2010, including chemical N fertilizer (78%), atmospheric N deposition (12%), and crop residues N (10%). Annual N2O emissions induced by N deposition were estimated at 97 Gg N, occupying 43% of total soil N2O emissions (228 Gg N) in agricultural systems over China. In particular, the largest N2O emissions caused by atmospheric N deposition were found in South China, followed by North China Plain and Southwest China. The efficiency of N deposition generating N2O emissions (3.0%) over China was 4 times than that of N fertilizer (0.7%). N2O emissions induced by N deposition increased from 81 Gg in 2000 to 93 Gg in 2014 (by 1% yr(-1)), which was consistent with the long-term trend of N deposition. This suggests N deposition accelerated soil N2O emissions largely contributing to global warming. Our results also indicated that 62% and 10% of soil N2O emissions were reduced by applying a nitrification inhibitor and N fertilizer with 20% decrease. We highlight the significance of considering N deposition in determining total soil N2O emissions over China. The results provide an important scientific basis for the prediction of greenhouse effect caused by N deposition over China.

Lowering soil greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing yields by increasing crop rotation diversity in the North China Plain. Intensive double cropping in the North China Plain has been challenged by serious environmental problems. Crop rotation is one of the important strategies for sustainable agriculture, which can reduce production risk and environmental impact. Yet, few studies have assessed enhanced crop rotation diversity on GHG emissions in the North China Plain. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and yields were measured from four cropping systems: (1) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) double cropping (WM); (2) peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and WM rotation (PWM); (3) ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), peanut and WM rotation (RCPWM); and (4) continuous cotton (C), to determine if enhanced crop rotation diversity can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve yields. The RCPWM, PWM and WM cropping system produced 11.9%, 15.7% and 32.4% higher net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), respectively, than the C cropping system each year by the soil-based method assessing the field productive process. From 2017 to 2018, in the same crop planting seasons, RCPWM had lower cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions, and produced similar peanut, wheat, and maize yields when compared to PWM. In 2018, PWM had higher cumulative N2O than WM during the wheat period, and they had similar seasonal cumulative N2O emissions during the maize period. Meanwhile, PWM produced lower cumulative CO2 emissions and higher wheat and maize yields. In 2019, RCPWM did not have significantly different seasonal cumulative N2O emissions and yield, but slightly higher soil CO2 emissions than C during the cotton season. The GHG emission intensity (GHGI) of the same crops was lower in RCPWM than in PWM during the peanut, wheat, and maize period or slightly higher than in the C treatment during cotton period. The results demonstrate that RCPWM could reduce soil N2O emissions when the same crops in PWM were compared due to less soil CO2 emissions that the previous cotton brought about. The RCPWM system did not show a lower soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate than the PWM and C systems. Therefore, increasing cotton into the peanut and wheat-maize rotation system (RCPWM) for more diversified system can help reduce soil GHG emissions without sacrificing yields.

Gross mineralization, nitrification and N2O emission under different tillage in the North China Plain. No-tillage cropping can increase soil carbon (C) stocks and aggregation, and subsequently impact the internal nitrogen (N) cycle and gas loss. The N-15 pool dilution method was used to study gross N transformations, and relative proportions of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions derived from denitrification versus nitrification-related processes under long-term tillage systems (no-tillage, rotary tillage and conventional tillage) in the North China Plain. In-field incubation experiments were repeated in successive growing seasons during April-November in 2007. Gross mineralization rates for rotary and mouldboard plough tillage (3.6 +/- A 0.3-10.6 +/- A 1.5 mg N kg(-1) days(-1)) were significantly higher than for no-tillage (1.7 +/- A 0.8-6.8 +/- A 1.1 mg N kg(-1) days(-1)). Gross mineralization was positively correlated with soil moisture and temperature, as well as with microbial biomass N and C. However, there was no consistent tillage effect on gross nitrification, and gross nitrification was positively correlated with soil moisture, but not with gross mineralization and microbial biomass. N2O emissions were higher in no-tillage (NT) than for conventional tillage (CT) during May-August. The N-15 labelling indicated that 26-92 % of the N2O was directly derived from the soil ammonium (NH4 (+)) pool. Emission rates of N2O from both nitrification and denitrification were positively correlated with NH4 (+) supply as expressed by gross mineralization, but not correlated with supply of nitrate as expressed by gross nitrification. The fraction of nitrified N emitted as N2O was positively correlated with changes in soil moisture and varied within 0.01-2.51 aEuro degrees. Our results showed that the tillage management impact on gross N transformation was not consistent with N2O emission, and more detailed information on the controls over N2O formation needs to be sought.

Greenhouse gas emissions from a wheat-maize double cropping system with different nitrogen fertilization regimes. Here, we report on a two-years field experiment aimed at the quantification of the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) from the dominant wheat maize double cropping system in North China Plain. The experiment had 6 different fertilization strategies, including a control treatment, recommended fertilization, with and without straw and manure applications, and nitrification inhibitor and slow release urea. Application of N fertilizer slightly decreased CH4 uptake by soil. Direct N2O emissions derived from recommended urea application was 0.39% of the annual urea-N input. Both straw and manure had relatively low N2O emissions factors. Slow release urea had a relatively high emission factor. Addition of nitrification inhibitor reduced N2O emission by 55%. We conclude that use of nitrification inhibitors is a promising strategy for N2O mitigation for the intensive wheat maize double cropping systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nitrifier denitrification can contribute to N2O emissions substantially in wet agricultural soil. Nitrifier denitrification (ND) is recognized as an important pathway for N2O production in agricultural soils, yet its contributions under different moisture contents are poorly quantified. Using an enriched dual isotope (N-15 - O-18) approach, we estimated N2O production from ND across eight moisture levels (40-120% water-filled pore space, WFPS) in a typical agricultural soil from the North China Plain. Total N2O flux began to increase when WFPS exceeded 70%, peaking at 100% WFPS, indicating substantial N2O emission potential in wet soils. In contrast, the N2O production from ND increased gradually from 40-70% WFPS, rose sharply from 70-90% WFPS, stabilized between 90-100% WFPS, and declined rapidly from 100-120% WFPS. ND contributed approximately 20%, 80%, and 30% of N2O emissions under low (40-50% WFPS), intermediate (60-70% WFPS), and high (80-120% WFPS) moisture conditions, respectively. Future contributions from ND may increase as irrigation and extreme rainfall events become more frequent under changing climates.

Yield-scaled N2O emissions were effectively reduced by biochar amendment of sandy loam soil under maize - wheat rotation in the North China Plain. It is increasingly recognized that the addition of biochar to soil has potential to mitigate climate change and increase soil fertility by enhancing carbon (C) storage. However, the effect of biochar on yield and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from upland fields remains unclear. In this study, a one-year field experiment was conducted in an area of calcareous fluvo-aquic soil to assess and quantify the effect of maize straw biochar in reducing N2O loss during 2014-2015 in the North China Plain. Eight treatments were designed as follows: no nitrogen (N) fertilizer (control, CK); biochar application at rates of 3 (B3), 6 (B6) and 12 (B12) t ha(-1); chemical fertilizer (NPK) application at 200 kg N ha(-1) (F); and fertilizer plus biochar application at rates of 3 (FB3), 6 (FB6) and 12 (FB12) t ha(-1). Crop yield, N2O fluxes, soil mineral N concentrations, and soil auxiliary parameters were measured following the application of treatments during each season. During the maize growing season, N2O emission was 0.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1) under CK treatment, and increased to 0.88, 0.93 and 1.10 kg N2O-N ha(-1) under B3, B6 and B12, respectively. In contrast, N2O emissions were significantly reduced by 31.4-39.9% (P < 0.05) under FB treatments compared with F, and the N2O emission factor of the applied N was reduced from 1.36% under F to 0.71 -0.85% under FB. There was also a significant interaction effect of fertilizer and biochar on N2O emissions (P < 0.01). During the wheat growing season, biochar had no effect on N2O emissions regardless of the fertilizer regime. Biochar application did not affect maize yield; however, a significant increase in wheat yield of 16.6-25.9% (P < 0.05) was observed without N fertilization. Nevertheless, a reduction in wheat yield was measured at a biochar rate of 12 t ha(-1) with fertilization. Overall, under maize cropping, N2O emissions per unit yield of grain, biomass, grain N and biomass N (yield-scaled N2O emissions) were significantly reduced by 32.4-39.9% under FB compared with F treatment, regardless of the biochar application rate. Biochar did not affect yield-scaled N2O emissions in wheat. Decreased soil bulk density with biochar is suggested to reduce the denitrification potential and N2O emissions; while increased retention capacity of fertilizer N in biochar-added soil decreased wheat growth and yield. These findings suggest that N fertilization plus biochar application at 3 t ha(-1) is a practical strategy for reducing yield scaled N2O emissions from maize fields in the North China Plain.

Potential effect of biogas slurry application to mitigate of peak N2O emission without compromising crop yield in North China Plain cropping systems. Biogas slurry (BS) produced from anaerobic digestion of livestock manure can be benefit for crop yields and soil fertility in cropping systems as compared to sole synthetic fertilization, but its impact on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is inconsistent in the literatures. The North China Plain (NCP) serves as a vital agricultural region in China, contributing approximately 40 % of the nation's total wheat and maize production. However, owing to the lack of relevant field studies, the understanding of how BS affects crop yield and N2O emissions in NCP remains unclear. Here, we assessed the effects of BS substitution (0 % substitution, CF; 50 % substitution, 50%BS; 100 % substitution, 100%BS) on the amount and sources of N2O emissions by monitoring N2O fluxes combined with the isotopomer ratios of soil-derived N2O in the NCP. The results showed that, compared with the control, CF, 50 % BS, and 100 % BS significantly increased wheat grain yield by 66.1 %-67.9 % and silage maize yield by 46.3 %-53.3 %, respectively. Compared with CF, 50%BS reduced N2O emissions by 40.1 % in the wheat season and by 35.5 % maize season, while 100%BS reduced N2O emissions by 31.9 % in the wheat season and by 49.2 % in the maize season. Further site preference analysis revealed that nitrification and fungal denitrification together contributed to 40.3-44.9 % of the peak N2O emissions in CF, 50%BS, and 100%BS, with no significant differences in SP values among them. Compared with CF, 100%BS significantly reduced the copy numbers of AOBamoA, nirK, and nirS by 65 %, 41 %, and 35 %, respectively, which may be key factors in reducing N2O emissions. Our results showed that the partial substitution of chemical fertilizers with BS is an efficacious practice for maintaining crop yields while simultaneously reducing N2O emissions in the NCP.

However, little is known about the environmental risks and application prospects of different cover crops in spring maize (Zea mays L.) monocultures proposed in the North China Plain. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different winter cover crops on subsequent maize yield, soil fertility, and environmental risks of nitrogen (N) loss, and a questionnaire survey was conducted to examine factors influencing farmers' willingness to adopt cover crops in the North China Plain. Based on the same fertilization regime during the maize growing period, four winter cover crop treatments were set up, including bare fallow, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), February orchid (Orychophragmus violaceus), and winter oilseed rape (Brassica campestris L.). The results indicated that winter cover crops significantly increased subsequent maize yield and soil organic carbon, total N, and microbial biomass carbon and N compared with the bare fallow treatment. The incorporation of cover crops led to a negligible increase in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and had a very limited effect on ammonia (NH3) emissions. The incorporation of February orchid and winter oilseed rape decreased nitrate leaching compared with the hairy vetch treatment in the maize growing season. The N losses via N2O and NH3 emissions and N leaching accounted for 71%-84% of the N surplus. However, yield increase and environmental benefits were not the main positive factors for farmers to accept cover crops. Financial incentive was rated by 83.9% of farmers as an \"extremely important\" factor, followed by other costs, when considering winter cover cropping. These results indicate that the environmental benefits depend on the type of cover crop. Maintaining high levels of soil fertility and maize yield, providing sufficient subsidies, and encouraging large-area cultivation of cover crops are critical measures to promote winter cover cropping in the North China Plain.

Effect of fertilizer N rates and straw management on yield-scaled nitrous oxide emissions in a maize-wheat double cropping system. Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring crop productivity simultaneously is a major challenge that demands the balance of the amounts of nitrogen (N) and straw (S) applied to agricultural soil. This study seeks to determine whether higher grain yields and lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions could be realized concomitantly by optimizing synthetic N rates and straw returning. The effect of fertilizer N rates and straw application on the inter-annual yield-scaled N2O emission variations was measured over a three-year period (2011-2014) in a maize-wheat cropping system on the North China Plain (NCP). Yield scaled N2O emissions were expressed as g N2O-N per Mg grain. Six treatments with three synthetic N levels (zero N [N-0], optimized N [N-opt] and conventional N [N-con]) and two straw management practices (straw removal [i.e., N-0, N-opt and N-con] and straw return [i.e., N-0 +S,N-opt +S and N-con + S]) were used. Optimized N (N-opt, N-opt + S) refers to the use of approximately 50% of the fertilizer N that is used in conventional farming practices (N-con, N-con +S), with no significant decrease in grain yields (P>0.05). Optimized N reduced cumulative N2O emissions by 18-37%, which in turn significantly decreased yield scaled N2O emissions by 38-42% (P < 0.05). The effects of fertilizer N rates and grain yields on cumulative N2O emissions are described by linear and exponential models, respectively. Straw return had a positive effect on mean yield-scaled N2O emissions both in the maize season and annually. Yield-scaled N2O emissions are constructive considering the trade-off between grain yield and N2O emission mitigation from intensive crop production. Optimized fertilizer N rate combined with straw return reduced yield scaled N2O emissions significantly in maize-wheat rotations. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Experimental warming-driven soil drying reduced N2O emissions from fertilized crop rotations of winter wheat-soybean/fallow, 2009-2014. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils play an important role in the global greenhouse gas budget. However, the response of N2O emissions from nitrogen fertilized agricultural soils to climate warming is not yet well understood. A field experiment with simulated warming (T) using infrared heaters and its control (C) combined with a nitrogen (N1) fertilization treatment (315 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and no nitrogen treatment (NO) was conducted over five years at an agricultural research station in the North China Plain in a winter wheat-soybean double cropping system. N2O fluxes were measured using static chambers about once every week during July 2009-June 2014. In the N1 treatment, warming decreased the soil moisture and N2O emissions in spring, autumn and winter and the annual cumulative emissions. Across all years, N2O fluxes were positively correlated with soil temperature and soil moisture. The effect of lower soil moisture on N2O fluxes exceeded that of higher temperature, leading to less N2O being released by the drier soils under warming. Nitrogen fertilizer increased N2O emissions without warming, but did not routinely increase N2O emissions under warming treatment. In the NO treatment, warming neither decreased soil water content nor N2O emissions. Temperature and nitrogen input had significant direct and antagonistic effects on cumulative N2O flux in the N1 treatment. The decrease in N2O emissions from N1 T was due to the significant decrease of soil water content, soil total nitrogen and organic matter, which consequently accelerated N cycle dynamics and advanced wheat growth.

Nitrous Oxide and Methane Fluxes During the Maize Season Under Optimized Management in Intensive Farming Systems of the North China Plain. Addressing concerns about mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while maintaining high grain yield requires improved management practices that achieve sustainable intensification of cereal production systems. In the North China Plain, a field experiment was conducted to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes during the maize (Zea mays L.) season under various agricultural management regimes including conventional treatment (CONT) with high N fertilizer application at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) and overuse of groundwater by flood irrigation, optimal fertilization 1 treatment (OPT1T), optimal fertilization 2 treatment (OPT2T), and controlled-release urea treatment (CRUT) with reduced N fertilizer application and irrigation, and a control (CK) with no N fertilizer. In contrast to CONT, balanced N fertilization treatments (OPT1T, OPT2T, and CRUT) and CK demonstrated a significant drop in cumulative N2O emission (1.70 v.s. 0.43-1.07 kg N ha(-1)), indicating that balanced N fertilization substantially reduced N2O emission. The values of the N2O emission factor were 0.42%, 0.29%, 0.32%, and 0.27% for CONT, OPT1T, OPT2T, and CRUT, respectively. Global warming potentials, which were predominantly determined by N2O emission, were estimated to be 188 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) for CK and 419-765 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) for the N fertilization treatments. Global warming potential intensity calculated by considering maize yield was significantly lower for OPT1T, OPT2T, CRUT, and CK than for CONT. Therefore, OPT1T, OPT2T, and CRUT were recommended as promising management practices for sustaining maize yield and reducing GHG emissions in the North China Plain.

Rainfall increasing offsets the negative effects of nighttime warming on GHGs and wheat yield in North China Plain. The effects of nighttime warming and rainfall increasing on crop productivity and soil greenhouse gas emissions are few studied. This study was conducted with a field experiment to investigate the effects of nighttime warming, rainfall increasing and their interaction on wheat grain yield, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during a winter wheat growing season in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that nighttime warming and rainfall increasing significantly altered soil temperature and moisture, and thus the CH4 and N2O emissions from the soil. Nighttime warming significantly promoted soil CH4 uptake by 21.2% and increased soil N2O emissions by 22.4%. Rainfall increasing stimulated soil N2O emissions by 15.7% but decreased soil CH4 uptake by 18.6%. Nighttime warming significantly decreased wheat yield by 5.5%, while rainfall increasing enhanced wheat yield by 4.0%. The results indicate that the positive effect of nighttime warming on CH4 uptake and negative effect on wheat yield can be offset by rainfall increasing in the NCP. Generally, rainfall increasing significantly raised the global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity induced by CH4 and N2O emissions. Overall, this study improves our understanding of agroecosystem C and N cycling in response to nighttime warming and rainfall increasing under future climate change.

Nitrous oxide emissions from maize-wheat field during 4 successive years in the North China Plain. Agricultural soil with fertilization is a main anthropogenic source for atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O fluxes from a maize-wheat rotation field in the North China Plain (NCP) were investigated for 4 successive years using the static chamber method. The annual N2O fluxes from the control (without fertilization) and fertilization plots were 1.5 +/- 0.2 and 9.4 +/- 1.7 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2008-2009, 2.0 +/- 0.01 and 4.0 +/- 0.03 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2009-2010, 1.3 +/- 0.02 and 5.0 +/- 0.3 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2010-2011, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 and 12.5 +/- 0.1 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2011-2012, respectively. Annual direct emission factors (EFd's) in the corresponding years were 2.4 +/- 0.5 %, 0.60 +/- 0.01 %, 1.1 +/- 0.09% and 2.9 +/- 0.2 %, respectively. Significant linear correlation between fertilized-induced N2O emissions (Y, kgNha(-1)) during the periods of 10 days after fertilization and rainfall intensities from 4 days before to 10 days after fertilization (X, mm) in the 4 years was found as Y = 0.048X - 1.1 (N = 4, R-2 = 0.99, P < 0.05). Therefore, the remarkable interannual variations of N2O emissions and the EFd's were mainly ascribed to the rainfall.

Response of winter wheat yield and soil N2O emission to nitrogen fertilizer reduction and nitrapyrin application in North China Plain. Over-fertilization could lead to nitrogen (N) losses and environmental risks, and the appropriate nitrogen fertilizer could reduce the nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and increase the N utilization of crops in the North China Plain. We investigated the effects of rationally reduced N fertilizer input and nitrapyrin (CP) application on N2O dynamic emission, soil N balance, yield, N utilization and net income during the whole wheat season. Five fertilization treatments included zero N (CK), farmers' traditional N rate (FN), recommended N rate (RN), the 20% reduction of RN (80%RN) and the 20% reduction of RN added with CP (80%RN+CP). The N2O emission fluxes from seedling stage to greening stage contributed to 51.1%-74.2% during the whole wheat growth stages. Moreover, the first peak of N2O emission was observed within half a month after N basal fertilizer, irrigation, and sowing, which was two times higher than the other peaks occurred after N top-dressing and irrigation. The cumulative N2O emission and N2O emission factor were significantly declined by 27.3%-43.4% and 8.9%-51.1% with 80%RN and 80%RN+CP as compared to FN, respectively. Grain yield, agronomic N use efficiency, apparent N use efficiency and N production efficiency with 80%RN+CP were increased by 1.74%-10.83%, 0.9-8.91 kg kg(-1), 1.9%-27.5% and 1.22-22.79 kg kg(-1) than other N treatments, respectively. Moreover, 80%RN+CP also decreased N loss by 7.88-55.62 kg ha(-1) as compared to FN and RN, which resulted in less soil NO3- retention. Consequently, the application of nitrapyrin with 20% reduction of N rate should be recommended to increase winter wheat economic benefits and mitigate environmental pollution in North China Plain.

Greenhouse gas emissions from the wheat-maize cropping system under different tillage and crop residue management practices in the North China Plain. With increasing attention being placed on mitigating global warming and achieving agricultural sustainable intensification, conservation agriculture practices have gradually been implemented in the North China Plain (NCP). However, there are still knowledge gaps on the effects of conservation practices on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this area. In this study, a four-year field experiment was conducted from 2014 to 2018 to assess the effects of tillage and crop residue management practices on the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Subsequently, crop yields, area-scaled and yield-scaled total non-carbon dioxide (CO2) GHG emissions were assessed. Our research found that no till (NT) decreased N2O emissions by 22.6% compared with conventional tillage (CT) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seasons, but there was no difference between tillage practices in summer maize (Zea mays L.) seasons. Crop residue retention practice (+R) increased N2O emissions by 28.1% and 26.7% compared with residue removal practice (-R) in winter wheat and summer maize seasons, respectively. The NT soils took up more CH4 compared with the CT soils in summer maize seasons. Area-scaled total non-CO2 GHG emissions showed trends similar to those of N2O emission. Since crop residue retention improved the maize yield compared with the residue removal treatments, yield scaled total non-CO2 GHGs emission did not differ between residue management practices in summer maize seasons. Our four-year field measurements indicated that no-till practice could be more useful as an option to mitigate non-CO2 GHG emissions in the wheat - maize cropping system.

Long-term effects of biochar addition and straw return on N2O fluxes and the related functional gene abundances under wheat-maize rotation system in the North China Plain. To evaluate long-term effects of biochar addition and straw return (SR) on N2O fluxes in wheat-maize rotation system, a 2-year field experiment following a 7-year biochar addition and SR was investigated in an intensively managed agricultural soil in the North China Plain (NCP). Four treatments were included: 1) no biochar addition (CK); 2) biochar treatment with 4.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (C1); 3) biochar treatment with 9.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (C2); and 4) all the wheat/maize straw return (SR). The results showed the annual cumulative N2O emissions from C1 treatment were increased by 15.9-16.5%, while C2 treatment suppressed the annual cumulative N2O emissions by 22.8-26.3%. In comparison, straw return suppressed N2O emissions by 13.4-43.6% in the wheat season but increased N2O emissions remarkably by 45.3-53.9% in the maize season. Biochar addition enhanced the copies of AOA, AOB, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes, while straw return decreased the copies of AOB, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes at the high N2O emission period in the maize season. The production of N2O in the maize season was mainly driven by the AOB and nosZ genes, and by AOB gene in the wheat season. These results suggest that application of 9.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1) biochar is a more optimum agricultural strategy for reducing N2O emission in the wheat-maize system.

Nitrous oxide emission from winter wheat field as responded to irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods in the North China Plain. Besides regulating soil water movements and nitrogen cycling, water management practices, such as irrigation schedule and irrigation methods, also affects possibly soil emission rates of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas. The scale of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods affecting N2O emission from winter wheat (Triticurn aestivum L.) fields remains unclear. Hence, a field experiment with three irrigation schedule levels and three irrigation methods was conducted to estimate the N2O emission qualitatively from winter wheat fields by using static chamber method during April to May in 2017 and 2018 in the North China Plain (NCP). Three irrigation methods, i.e., sprinkler irrigation, surface drip irrigation, and flood irrigation were scheduled to irrigate the winter wheat immediately as the mean moisture of soil layer 0-100 cm depleted to 50%, 60% and 70% of the field capacity (FC). The research results show that both the irrigation schedule and irrigation methods influenced significantly (P < 0.05) N2O emissions, global warming potential of N2O emission (GWP(N2O)), grain yield, and water use efficiency (WUE). Surface drip irrigation at 60% FC, compared with sprinkler and flood irrigation at same schedule level, lowered substantially (P < 0.05) GWP N2O of 15-16% and 27-30%, improved grain yield of 5-8% and 6-7% and raised WUE of about 1-6% and 8-6% in 2017 and 2018 winter wheat season respectively. Relevant data also showed that the combination of surface drip irrigation and schedule level of 60% FC is reasonable to be recommended for winter wheat irrigation practice regarding better yield sustainability, higher WUE, and mitigating N2O emission in the NCP.

Influences of shallow groundwater depth on N 2 O diffusion along the soil profile of summer maize fields in North China Plain. The emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from agricultural fields are a significant contribution to global warming. Understanding the mechanisms of N 2 O emissions from agricultural fields is essential for the development of N 2 O emission mitigation strategies. Currently, there are extensive studies on N 2 O emissions on the surface of agricultural soils, while studies on N 2 O fluxes at the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zones (ISU) are limited. Uncertainties exist regarding N 2 O emissions from the soil -shallow groundwater systems in agricultural fields. In this study, a three-year lysimeter experiment (2019 - 2020, 2022) was conducted to simulate the soilshallow groundwater systems under four controlled shallow groundwater depth (SGD) (i.e., SGD = 40, 70, 110, and 150 cm) conditions in North China Plain (NCP). Weekly continuous monitoring of N 2 O emissions from soil surface, N 2 O concentration in the shallow groundwater and the upper 10 cm of pores at the ISU, and nitrogen cycling -related parameters in the soil and groundwater was conducted. The results showed that soil surface N 2 O emissions increased with decreased shallow groundwater depth, and the highest emissions of 96.44 kg ha -1 and 104.32 kg ha -1 were observed at G2 (SGD = 40 cm) in 2020 and 2022. During the observation period of one maize growing season, shallow groundwater acted as a sink for the unsaturated zone when the groundwater depth was 40 cm, 70 cm, and 110 cm. However, when SGD was 150 cm, shallow groundwater became a source for the unsaturated zone. After fertilization, the groundwater in all treatment plots behaved as a sink for the unsaturated zone, and the diffusion intensity decreased with increasing SGD. The results would provide a theoretical basis for cropland water management to reduce N 2 O emissions.

In situ 15N-N2O site preference and O2 concentration dynamics disclose the complexity of N2O production processes in agricultural soil. Arable soil continues to be the dominant anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions owing to application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers and manures across the world. Using laboratory and in situ studies to elucidate the key factors controlling soil N2O emissions remains challenging due to the potential importance of multiple complex processes. We examined soil surface N2O fluxes in an arable soil, combined with in situ high-frequency measurements of soil matrix oxygen (O-2) and N2O concentrations, in situ N-15 labeling, and N2O N-15 site preference (SP). The in situ O-2 concentration and further microcosm visualized spatiotemporal distribution of O-2 both suggested that O-2 dynamics were the proximal determining factor to matrix N2O concentration and fluxes due to quick O-2 depletion after N fertilization. Further SP analysis and in situ N-15 labeling experiment revealed that the main source for N2O emissions was bacterial denitrification during the hot-wet summer with lower soil O-2 concentration, while nitrification or fungal denitrification contributed about 50.0% to total emissions during the cold-dry winter with higher soil O-2 concentration. The robust positive correlation between O-2 concentration and SP values underpinned that the O-2 dynamics were the key factor to differentiate the composite processes of N2O production in in situ structured soil. Our findings deciphered the complexity of N2O production processes in real field conditions, and suggest that O-2 dynamics rather than stimulation of functional gene abundances play a key role in controlling soil N2O production processes in undisturbed structure soils. Our results help to develop targeted N2O mitigation measures and to improve process models for constraining global N2O budget.

This study was conducted on double cropping system of winter wheat and summer corn in North China with four treatments (conventional tillage CT, conventional tillage with straw retention CTS, no-tillage with straw retention NTS, rotary tillage with straw retention RTS). In order to study tillage effects on field GHG emissions, CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions fluxes were collected. Results showed that soils of each the treatment were net sources of CO2, but RTS and NTS consumed atmospheric CH4, while N2O emission exhibited high annual flux in all the treatments except RTS; soil moisture contents in NTS were maximum (19.3%) and significantly higher compared to the other treatments (at P<0.05 level); CO2 emission fluxes (g CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) were generally in the order of CTS (6460.3) > CT (5568.4) > RTS (5421.2) > NTS (4200.1); integrated evaluation of field greenhouse effect indicated that it was mainly caused by CO2, with CH4 and N2O as subsidiary components; total greenhouse effect under different tillage treatments was followed NTS < RTS < CT < CTS in North China Plain.

Enhanced N2O Emissions from Winter Wheat Field Induced by Winter Irrigation in the North China Plain. Winter irrigation is important for wheat in meeting crop water requirements in spring, but it alters soil moisture dynamics and affects soil N2O production and emission. To assess the effects of winter irrigation on soil N2O emissions in a winter wheat field, an in situ experiment was conducted from 1 October 2019 to 1 March 2020 with one control treatment (CK) and five levels of winter irrigation quantities (irrigated to 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% of the soil water holding capacity, namely WHC60-WHC100, respectively). The results showed that winter irrigation had an impact on soil N 2 0 emission. The emission peaks were not investigated immediately after winter irrigation, but at two days after, which were increased by 4.3-17.0 mu g.m(-2).h(-1) under WHC60-100 treatments compared to the CK. The cumulative N2O emissions after winter irrigation from WHC60-100 were 1.1-3.9 times higher than that of CK, indicating that the cumulative N2O emission has an increase trend with the increase of soil water content regulated by irrigations. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the correlation between soil N2O flux and soil temperature were moderate with correlation coefficients of about 0.65. While the correlation between soil N2O flux and soil water content was poor during the investigate winter season with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.08 and 0.25. Future studies should focus on the general N2O emission responses to winter irrigation and environmental factors with the support of experiment data from several winter seasons.

Soil pH and long-term fertilization affect gross N transformation and N2O production pathways in Chinese and UK croplands. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions occur as a consequence of the turnover of soil nitrogen (N), but gross N transformations and N2O production are often not studied in combination, so the relationships are poorly understood. Here, we quantified gross N transformations and the N2O production pathway of alkaline fluvo-aquic soils under different fertilization regimes collected from a long-term field experiment in the North China Plain and compared them with six acidic UK soils (one was alkaline for reference) with high soil organic carbon (SOC). We found that nitrification was the dominant N2O production pathway in the alkaline Chinese soil with a contribution of nitrification to N2O emissions (N2Onit) of 81%. By contrast, denitrification was the main N2O production pathway for the acidic UK soils with the contribution of denitrification to N2O emissions (N2Oden) of 66%. Long-term manure applications significantly increased N2Oden, compared to the synthetic N and no N treatments (25% vs. 18%). The N2Onit was positively correlated with gross autotrophic nitrification rates and pH but negatively correlated with gross N mineralization, SOC, soil total N content, and C:N ratios. Our findings highlight the importance of soil pH in controlling the N2O production in cropland soils, and suggest that the increased contribution of denitrification to N2O emissions should be considered, when increasing SOC through long-term manure and straw management for carbon sequestration and soil fertility improvement.

Nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) reducesN2Oemissions by altering the soil microbial community in a wheat-maize rotation on the North China Plain. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas that is released from agricultural ecosystems where nitrogen fertilizers are poorly used and contributes to global climate warming. Large nitrogen fertilizer inputs in summer maize fields on the North China Plain (NCP) lead to large N2O emissions. N2O emissions can be mitigated using 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), but the efficiency and microbial mechanisms of this mitigation at different nitrogen rates remain poorly understood. To evaluate the efficiency of N2O emission mitigation by DMPP at different nitrogen rates and to explore its mechanisms at the microbial level, we monitored the dynamic changes in mineral and N2O fluxes and analysed the abundance and community structure of ammonia oxidizers. We found that DMPP significantly inhibited the oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3-) and thus maintained NH(4)(+)concentrations but decreased the peak value of NO(3)(-)concentrations. Total N2O emissions were increased by 6.5-fold, 13.2-fold and 26.7-fold in fields with 112.5 kg N ha(-1), 225 kg N ha(-1)and 337.5 kg N ha(-1), respectively, compared with fields with no nitrogen applied. Nitrogen increased the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and decreased that of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), whereas DMPP exhibited the opposite effects. Therefore, AOB could be the dominant N2O emission contributors in nitrogen-treated soils. Sequencing results suggested that all AOB belong to theNitrosospiraandNitrosomonas nitrosagroups, and all AOA fell within theNitrososphaeragroup. In both AOB and AOA communities, changes in the second-largest cluster after the application of nitrogen fertilizer and DMPP were more pronounced than those in the largest cluster. The potential functional clusters of AOB and AOA wereNitrosospiracluster 3b andNitrososphaeracluster 4.1, respectively. This study showed that nitrogen and DMPP both affected the abundance and structure of ammonia-oxidizer communities, which may contribute to the variations in N2O emissions from croplands. Highlights Role of soil microorganisms in the efficiency of DMPP to reduce N2O emissions under different N inputs was explored. N input increased N2O emissions and DMPP reduced N2O emissions N and DMPP affect N2O emission via a changed key cluster of ammonia oxidizers. DMPP was more efficient at higher nitrogen input levels.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from a wheat-maize rotation system while still maintaining productivity. High-input agriculture in China has successfully increased crop productivity in the past decades, but at a significant environmental cost. It is essential to improve management strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental costs, while maintaining grain yields. However, there is a lack of studies to evaluate mitigation strategies under long-term climate variability. This paper combines field experimental data and soil-plant systems modeling to investigate the potential for improving water and nitrogen management of a wheat-maize double cropping system in North China Plain. The APSIM model was calibrated against the data and then applied to simulate crop yield and N2O emissions from soil in response to irrigation and nitrogen inputs. Our results show that the N fertilizer rate and irrigation amount under the local farmer practice could be reduced by 28% and 14% without sacrificing crop yield. This in turn led to a reduction in GHG emissions by 31%, mainly attributed to the decrease in emissions from the production and transportation of N fertilizer and direct N2O emissions from soil. Additionally, the results indicate that the direct N2O emissions from soil was positively correlated with N inputs, implying an increasing emission factor (N2O produced per unit of N input) with N application rates. It is concluded that potential exists to optimize N fertilizer rate and irrigation amount to reduce GHG emissions while still maintaining crop yield in the agro-ecosystems in North China Plain.

Replacing chemical fertilizer with manure reduces N2O emissions in winter wheat-summer maize cropping system under limited irrigation. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agroecosystems are a major contributor to global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. However, knowledge concerning the hotspots and hot moments of soil N2O emissions with manure application and irrigation, as well as the underlying mechanisms remain incomplete. Here, a 3-year field experiment was conducted with the combination of fertilization (no fertilizer, F0; 100% chemical fertilizer N, Fc; 50% chemical N + 50% manure N, Fc + m; and 100% manure N, Fm) and irrigation (with irrigation, W1; and without irrigation, W0; at wheat jointing stage) for winter wheat - summer maize cropping system in the North China Plain. Results showed that irrigation did not affect annual N2O emissions of the wheat-maize system. Manure application (Fc + m and Fm) reduced annual N2O emissions by 25-51% compared with Fc, which mainly occurred during 2 weeks after fertilization combined with irrigation (or heavy rainfall). In particular, Fc + m reduced the cumulative N2O emissions during 2 weeks after winter wheat sowing and summer maize top dressing by 0.28 and 0.11 kg ha-1, respectively, compared with Fc. Meanwhile, Fm maintained the grain N yield and Fc + m increased grain N yield by 8% compared with Fc under W1. Overall, Fm maintained the annual grain N yield and lower N2O emissions compared to Fc under W0, and Fc + m increased the annual grain N yield and maintained N2O emissions compared with Fc under W1, respectively. Our results provide scientific support for using manure to minimize N2O emissions while maintaining crop N yield under optimal irrigation to support the green transition in agricultural production.

Interactive effects of irrigation system and level on grain yield, crop water use, and greenhouse gas emissions of summer maize in North China Plain. Irrigation management is one of most critical factors influencing soil N2O and CO2 emissions in dryland agriculture. To explore the effects of irrigation systems and levels on the mitigation of N2O and CO2 emissions from maize fields and to determine the balance among greenhouse gases (GHG) emission, water-saving and grain yield, a two-year field exper-iment was conducted in the North China Plain (NCP) during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019. Two irrigation systems (i.e., flood irrigation, FI, and drip irrigation, DI) were adopted with four irrigation levels in each system, including 65 mm/event (sufficient irrigation, CK), 50 mm/event (decreased by 23 %), 35 mm/event (by 46 %) and 20 mm/event (by 69 %), respectively. The results showed that both irrigation systems and levels had significant effects on soil N2O and CO2 emissions (P < 0.05). Nitrous oxide (N2O) and CO2 emissions peaked following irrigation or irri-gation + fertilization events during sowing to early filling stage (R1), with the peak values increasing with irrigation levels. Meanwhile, peak values from FI were higher than those from DI at 50 mm and 65 mm irrigation levels. The average cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions of DI treatments were 14.9 % and 6.23 % lower than those of FI treatments (P < 0.05), respectively. Soil moisture was identified as one of the most crucial factors influencing N2O and CO2 fluxes. Deficit irrigation efficiently deceased cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions, but moderate to severe deficit irrigation brought significant reduction in grain yield. Drip irrigation with a slight deficit irrigation level (decreased by 23 %) obtained the best economic and environmental benefits, which achieved the dual goal of lower GHG emissions but higher WUE without sacrificing grain yield.

Methane, Carbon Dioxide and Nitrous Oxide Fluxes in Soil Profile under a Winter Wheat-Summer Maize Rotation in the North China Plain. The production and consumption of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in soil profile are poorly understood. This work sought to quantify the GHG production and consumption at seven depths (0-30, 30-60, 60-90, 90-150, 150-200, 200-250 and 250-300 cm) in a long-term field experiment with a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system, and four N application rates (0; 200; 400 and 600 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) in the North China Plain. The gas samples were taken twice a week and analyzed by gas chromatography. GHG production and consumption in soil layers were inferred using Fick's law. Results showed nitrogen application significantly increased N2O fluxes in soil down to 90 cm but did not affect CH4 and CO2 fluxes. Soil moisture played an important role in soil profile GHG fluxes; both CH4 consumption and CO2 fluxes in and from soil tended to decrease with increasing soil water filled pore space (WFPS). The top 0-60 cm of soil was a sink of atmospheric CH4, and a source of both CO2 and N2O, more than 90% of the annual cumulative GHG fluxes originated at depths shallower than 90 cm; the subsoil (>90 cm) was not a major source or sink of GHG, rather it acted as a 'reservoir'. This study provides quantitative evidence for the production and consumption of CH4, CO2 and N2O in the soil profile.

Using nitrification inhibitors and deep placement to tackle the trade-offs between NH3 and N2O emissions in global croplands. Ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are two important air pollutants that have major impacts on climate change and biodiversity losses. Agriculture represents their largest source and effective mitigation measures of individual gases have been well studied. However, the interactions and trade-offs between NH3 and N2O emissions remain uncertain. Here, we report the results of a two-year field experiment in a wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain (NCP), a global hotspot of reactive N emissions. Our analysis is supported by a literature synthesis of global croplands, to understand the interactions between NH3 and N2O emissions and to develop the most effective approaches to jointly mitigate NH3 and N2O emissions. Field results indicated that deep placement of urea with nitrification inhibitors (NIs) reduced both emissions of NH3 by 67% to 90% and N2O by 73% to 100%, respectively, in comparison with surface broadcast urea which is the common farmers' practice. But, deep placement of urea, surface broadcast urea with NIs, and application of urea with urease inhibitors probably led to trade-offs between the two gases, with a mitigation potential of -201% to 101% for NH3 and -112% to 89% for N2O. The literature synthesis showed that deep placement of urea with NIs had an emission factor of 1.53%-4.02% for NH3 and 0.22%-0.36% for N2O, which were much lower than other fertilization regimes and the default values recommended by IPCC guidelines. This would translate to a reduction of 3.86-5.47 Tg N yr(-1) of NH3 and 0.41-0.50 Tg N yr(-1) of N2O emissions, respectively, when adopting deep placement of urea with NIs (relative to current practice) in global croplands. We conclude that the combination of NIs and deep placement of urea can successfully tackle the trade-offs between NH3 and N2O emissions, therefore avoiding N pollution swapping in global croplands.

Influence of Crop Residue Management and Soil Tillage Method on Reducing the Carbon Footprint of Winter Wheat Production in the Salt-Affected Arable Land in the North China Plain. Salt-affected arable land is distributed widely in China, especially in the North China Plain. Crop residue management under appropriate tillage is critical to improving salt-affected soil organic carbon and reducing the carbon footprint. This study conducted four-year field experiments including two treatments (residue incorporated into soil with plough tillage (CT+); residue mulching with no-till (NT+)) in two sites (non-saline soil and salt-affected soil); the carbon footprint of wheat production was analyzed by life cycle assessment. The results showed that the carbon footprint of wheat production in the salt-affected soil was significantly larger than that in the non-saline soil, because the salt-affected soil exhibited higher N2O emission than the non-saline soil. CT+ has lower carbon footprint than the NT+, mainly due to the lower N2O emission and higher carbon sequestration in the CT+ compared to NT+. As for the salt-affected soil, the largest contributor of the carbon footprint per unit area was soil N2O emission, with a relative contribution of 40%; the largest contributor of the carbon footprint per unit yield was carbon sequestration, with a relative importance of 47-50%. Our results indicated that wheat production in salt-affected land has a high carbon footprint, while it can be decreased by incorporating crop residue into the soil under the plough tillage.

Impacts of natural factors and farming practices on greenhouse gas emissions in the North China Plain: A meta-analysis. Requirements for mitigation of the continued increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are much needed for the North China Plain (NCP). We conducted a meta-analysis of 76 published studies of 24 sites in the NCP to examine the effects of natural conditions and farming practices on GHG emissions in that region. We found that N2O was the main component of the area-scaled total GHG balance, and the CH4 contribution was <5%. Precipitation, temperature, soil pH, and texture had no significant impacts on annual GHG emissions, because of limited variation of these factors in the NCP. The N2O emissions increased exponentially with mineral fertilizer N application rate, with y=0.2389e(0.0058x) for wheat season and y=0.365e(0.0071x) for maize season. Emission factors were estimated at 0.37% for wheat and 0.90% for maize at conventional fertilizer N application rates. The agronomic optimal N rates (241 and 185kgNha(-1) for wheat and maize, respectively) exhibited great potential for reducing N2O emissions, by 0.39 (29%) and 1.71 (56%)kgN(2)O-Nha(-1)season(-1) for the wheat and maize seasons, respectively. Mixed application of organic manure with reduced mineral fertilizer N could reduce annual N2O emissions by 16% relative to mineral N application alone while maintaining a high crop yield. Compared with conventional tillage, no-tillage significantly reduced N2O emissions by 30% in the wheat season, whereas it increased those emissions by 10% in the maize season. This may have resulted from the lower soil temperature in winter and increased soil moisture in summer under no-tillage practice. Straw incorporation significantly increased annual N2O emissions, by 26% relative to straw removal. Our analysis indicates that these farming practices could be further tested to mitigate GHG emission and maintain high crop yields in the NCP.

Characteristics of nitrous oxide emissions and the affecting factors from vegetable fields on the North China Plain. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the most important greenhouse gases emitted from fertilized agricultural soils. Vegetable fields, mostly managed under intensive mode with higher rate nitrogen application, frequent irrigation, and multiple planting-harvest cycles, does contribute to national GHG inventory greatly due to the increasing planting area in China. N2O emissions from four different fields a maize field (maize), a newly established open-ground vegetable field converted from a maize field four years earlier (OV4), an established open-ground vegetable field converted from a maize field more than 20 years ago (OV20), and an established sunlight heated greenhouse vegetable field converted from a maize field more than 20 years ago (GV20) with four different fertilization treatments for the OV4 field were measured using the closed chamber method between March 15th, 2012 and March 14th, 2013 in suburban area of Beijing, North China Plain. Results showed that the annual N2O emissions from vegetable fields were 3.1-4.6 times higher than the typical maize field. All the N2O emission peaks were occurred after fertilization and the fertilization associated emissions accounted for 81.1% (ranging from 77.0% to 87.2%) of the annual N2O emission with 22.2% time duration in the whole year for vegetable fields. Both the occurrence data and duration of N2O emission peaks were associated with N input type (chemical or manure) and the application rate. The N2O emission peaks appeared earlier (on the 3rd day after application) and lasted shorter when only chemical N was applied; while they appeared later (on the 7th to 10th day after application) and lasted longer when the combination of manure and chemical N were applied. The magnitudes of N2O emission peaks increased when the N application rate was higher. Dicyandiamide (DCD) decreased N2O emissions by 30.1% and 21.1% in the spring cucumber and autumn cabbage seasons respectively (averaged of 24.7% over the whole year). Calculations showed that it is critical to estimate the emission factor (EF) by N type in order to decrease the uncertainty of regional N2O emissions when using EF as calculation method. EFs were 0.20% and 0.42% for manure N in the cucumber and cabbage seasons respectively; and were 0.55-1.30% and 0.8-1.59% for chemical N in the cucumber and cabbage seasons respectively.

Effects of optimized N fertilization on greenhouse gas emission and crop production in the North China Plain. Improving nitrogen (N) efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are dual challenges of the agricultural sector in the North China Plain (NCP). Most relevant studies conducted in the NCP lasted only 1-2 years without sufficiently addressing the temporal variations of weather conditions and farming practices over different seasons. Thus, a 4-year (2008-2012) field experiment was conducted for a wheat-maize cropping system in a typical intensive agricultural region of the NCP. The three N application rates were (a) control without N application (CK); (b) farmers' conventional N fertilization (CON), i.e., 600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); and (c) optimized N fertilization (OPT), i.e., 420 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), N uptake and crop production were measured. Compared with CON, the annual cumulative N2O emissions from OPT decreased by 40.9%, 7.2%, and 223% during the 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 rotation years, respectively. Basal N fertilization in the wheat season was the critical period for N2O mitigation, although the maize season contributed 51%-89% of the annual N2O emission. CH4 uptake (CO2-equivalent) via soil accounted for 60%-96% of N2O in CK treatment and 4%-48% in fertilization treatments, indicating that CH4 should be considered in the overall GHG emissions from crop production. Compared with CON, OPT significantly improved N efficiency by 46%-52% for wheat and maize and maintained a similar or higher crop yield. Improvements in N efficiency should focus on the maize season. Water saving practices exhibited high potential to reduce indirect GHG emissions for the entire life cycle of crop production. Compared with CON, OPT significantly reduced the GHG intensity, particularly in the wheat season.

Impacts of nitrogen management and organic matter application on nitrous oxide emissions and soil organic carbon from spring maize fields in the North China Plain. Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and carbon (C) sequestration are important processes for determining net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maize fields. Farming management practices (FMPs) substantially affect crop productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), and N2O emissions. However, relative knowledge is not sufficient, and further research is required for sustainable agriculture development. A multiyear experiment was performed on a spring maize field in the North China Plain (NCP) to quantify changes in SOC stocks, N2O emissions, and maize yields. Seven treatments were involved in the experiment, including no N fertilization (CK), farmers' conventional N fertilization (FP), sole application of manure N (M), a combination of M and FP (MFP), FP combined with returned maize straw (SFP), fertilization with reduced synthetic N amount (RN), and fertilization with both reduced synthetic and manure N (RMN). The field measurements demonstrated that urea applications and returned maize straw increased N2O emission. The seasonal total N2O emissions under FP were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those under CK by 176% to 222% and lower than those under SFP by 20% to 61% throughout the three maize growing seasons. The application of organic manure or maize straw enhanced SOC storage for the studied cropping system. The SOC stocks were relatively high in the plots that received applications of organic manure or maize straw, with the SOC stock of the M plot being significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the CK, FP, SFP, RN, and RMN plots in 2016 after eight years of manure amendments. The average net GHG emission from 2012 to 2014 was 203 kg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) year(-1) (i.e., a net GHG source) under FP. The other treatments converted the maize fields from net GHG sources to GHG sinks. By considering both the maize yields and net GHG emissions, RMN would be an optimal management option, although MFP, SFP, and RN also mitigated the GHG emissions and maintained the yields. Large variations were observed in the contributions of the SOC changes and N2O emissions to net GHG emissions among the treatments. The large variations demonstrate the need to consider both SOC changes and N2O emissions when evaluating the impacts of alternative FMPs on net GHG emissions.

An improved microelectrode method reveals significant emission of nitrous oxide from the rhizosphere of a long-term fertilized soil in the North China Plain. Microsensors are able to accurately quantify nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in microenvironments at high spatiotemporal resolution: yet, limited studies have been conducted on agricultural soils due to the inability to obtain electrical signal under conditions of low soil moisture. This study improved the calibration of a microelectrode for measuring N2O emissions from agricultural soil. The microelectrode was applied to evaluate the effect of long-term fertilization with mineral fertilizer (NPK), complemented with pig manure (MNPK), straw (SNPK), or without fertilizer (CK), all with and without urea addition, on N2O emissions from the soil, with explicit separation of the rhizosphere and the bulk soil compartments. The use of soil solution instead of pure water for calibration of the microelectrode doubled the signal and significantly improved the sensor sensitivity. The optimal electrolytic concentration of the soil solution, expressed as water: soil ratio, was found at the maximum vertex of the quadratic equation fitted on the slope values of the calibration equations for different soil solutions. The application of the calibrated microelectrode revealed significantly higher N2O emission from the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil, accounting for 60% of the total emission. For the bulk soil, MNPK significantly increased N2O emissions compared to SNPK and NPK, whereas the differences between these treatments for the rhizosphere soil were insignificant. The statistical modeling revealed significant relation of the N2O emission with soil inorganic nitrogen contents and an additive effect of treatment (MNPK and SNPK), urea addition and rhizosphere soil. This study provides novel insights into the use of microelectrodes for measuring N2O emissions from the soil microenvironment and also points on the rhizosphere compartment and the management practices of agroecosystems able to reduce the N2O emission from agriculture.

Reducing Soil-Emitted Nitrous Acid as a Feasible Strategy for Tackling Ozone Pollution. Severe ozone (O-3) pollution has been a major air quality issue and affects environmental sustainability in China. Conventional mitigation strategies focusing on reducing volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides (NOx) remain complex and challenging. Here, through field flux measurements and laboratory simulations, we observe substantial nitrous acid (HONO) emissions (F-HONO) enhanced by nitrogen fertilizer application at an agricultural site. The observed F-HONO significantly improves model performance in predicting atmospheric HONO and leads to regional O-3 increases by 37%. We also demonstrate the significant potential of nitrification inhibitors in reducing emissions of reactive nitrogen, including HONO and NOx, by as much as 90%, as well as greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide by up to 60%. Our findings introduce a feasible concept for mitigating O-3 pollution: reducing soil HONO emissions. Hence, this study has important implications for policy decisions related to the control of O-3 pollution and climate change.

Effect of fertilizer deep placement and nitrification inhibitor on N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3 emissions from a maize field in the North China Plain. Fertilized soil is an essential source of atmospheric gaseous nitrogen compounds (GNC, including N2O, 2 O, NO, HONO, and NH3) 3 ) that play important roles in global warming and regional air pollution. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the exchange fluxes of these gases between soil and the atmosphere, let alone exploration of mitigation measures. Herein, the fluxes of N2O, 2 O, NO, HONO, and NH3 3 under different fertilization treatments (surface fertilization (SF), deep fertilization (DF), DF with added nitrification inhibitor (DN), and control (CK, non-fertilization)) were comparatively investigated by open-top dynamic chambers in a maize field in the North China Plain (NCP) in 2022. The results showed that fertilization significantly promoted soil GNC emissions under SF and DF treatments, while there was no significant increase in GNC emissions except for NH3 3 under the DN treatment after fertilization. In comparison to the SF treatment, the cumulative emissions under the DF treatment exhibited a significant reduction, amounting to 80.8% for N2O, 2 O, 89.4% for NO, 88.3% for HONO, 84.8% for NH3, 3 , and 83.9% for the total emissions of these four gases. These results emphasize the effect of fertilizer deep placement in mitigating soil GNC emissions, and further reductions were observed when using nitrification inhibitors like dicyandiamide (DCD). Compared with the cumulative emissions under the SF treatment, the DN treatment showed reductions exceeding 95% for N2O, 2 O, NO, and HONO, and 77.1% for NH3 3 due to the inhibition of ammonia oxidation by DCD, resulting in an overall reduction of 88.8% for the four gases. Therefore, we advocate deep placement of fertilizer with or without nitrification inhibitors during crop cultivation to achieve a comprehensive reduction in GNC emissions and improve regional air quality.

Fertilizer N triggers native soil N-derived N2O emissions by priming gross N mineralization. Recent 15nitrogen (N) tracing studies have shown that unlabeled N2O emissions (UNEs) following 15N fertilizer application tend to be higher than those from zero-N controls, which indicates a potential risk for elevated N2O emissions from native soil. However, researchers do not clearly understand whether these increased UNEs are derived from a priming effect or how interactions between N in fertilizer and native soil affect various sources of N2O emissions. Here, we combined 15N tracing and 15N pool dilution in an incubation study to track gross N transformations, specific sources of N2O emissions, and N2O-production pathways following N fertilization. Four treatments, including two fertilizer N levels (0 and 120 mg N kg(-1)) in conjunction with two native soil N levels (0.56 and 1.25 g kg(-1)), were established in the study. Soil gross N mineralization (GM) increased by 33.0%- 98.5% (4.59-14.97 mg N kg(-1)) after N fertilizer addition, which indicated a positive priming effect on soil N turnover and resulted in additional native soil N-derived N2O emissions. In addition to priming GM, the pool substitution effect after 15N addition, which was not triggered by stimulated soil N turnover, also generated substrates for the UNEs. Therefore, overlooking the pool substitution effect might overestimate native soil N-derived emissions by 104%-180%. Differentiation of the specific N2O emission sources showed that both the fertilizer N-and primed native soil N-derived N2O emissions were dominated by nitrifier-mediated processes, which were governed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. At a specified N fertilizer addition rate, soils with higher native N levels had greater levels of fertilizer N-and native soil N-derived N2O emissions due to the higher GM and gross nitrification rates. The study reveals that fertilizer N application triggers potential N2O emissions from native soil N by stimulating the GM and nitrifier-mediated N2O-production processes.

Biochar effects on crop yields and nitrogen loss depending on fertilization. Biochar (BC) application to low fertility soils is a promising approach to increase crop yield, improve soil quality, and mitigate climate change simultaneously. Only few studies evaluated the combined effects of BC and nitrogen (N) fertilization rates on crop productivity and N losses under field conditions. The objectives were to investigate combined effects of BC (2 rates) and N (5 rates) fertilization on crop productivity and N losses in a long-term field experiment started in 2008 in a winter wheat/summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain. Linear-plateau models best described the responses of wheat and maize yields to N rates. N2O fluxes, NH3 volatilization, and soil mineral N contents increased exponentially with N fertilization rates. Despite the effect of BC on wheat or maize yields was negligible, BC retains of mineral N at 240 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). BC application increased NH3 volatilization by 31% in wheat season and 26% in maize season because of pH increase. BC reduced N2O emissions by 8-23% in the wheat season and by 24% at lower N rates (<= 60 kg ha(-1)) in the maize season, due to BC induced complete denitrification to N-2. BC stimulated N2O emissions by 18-26% compared to soils without BC in maize season at N rates higher than 60 kg ha(-1). The combination of increased mineral N retention and C availability with BC addition increased nitrification and/or denitrification rates, leading to increased N2O emissions. For the wheat/maize rotation system, BC application decreased N2O emissions at lower N rates (<= 120 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) but had no effects at higher N rates. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of the shallow groundwater table on the groundwater N2O and direct N2O emissions in summer maize field in the North China Plain. Agriculture is an important N2O emissions source. Water cycle and nitrogen cycles have important effects on N2O in farmland ecosystems. The changes in the groundwater table can lead to changes in farmland the water and nitrogen cycle processes. However, how this such changes will affect N2O emissions from farmland remains unclear. In this study, a two-year volume lysimeter experiment (2019-2020), including four controlled groundwater tables (i.e., 40, 70, 110, and 150 cm), was performed to monitor the variations in the NO3- and N2O concentrations in shallow groundwater as well as the direct N2O emissions due to surface soil and groundwater evaporation. Our results showed that N2O emissions during fertilization accounted for 80%-90% of the total N2O emissions throughout the maize growing period. Direct N2O emissions increase with the increase in the groundwater table. The total N2O emissions in 2020 were 96.44, 9.75, 6.46, and 6.22 kg ha(-1) y(-1) at a groundwater table of 40, 70, 110, and 150 cm, respectively. The high water-filled pore space (WFPS) value resulting from the elevated groundwater table increased the groundwater-atmosphere connectivity, leading to significantly increased N2O emissions after fertilization. Increased precipitation (454.90 mm in 2020 vs. 180.30 mm in 2019) accelerated the hydrological processes in agroecology, reducing the retention time of N2O (6 weeks in 2020 vs. 7.5 weeks in 2019) and NO3- (6.75 weeks in 2020 vs. 7.25 weeks in 2019) in shallow groundwater. Studying the influence of shallow groundwater tables on direct N2O emissions will provide insights into the interaction between the water and nitrogen cycles in agroecosystems. The results of this study suggest that direct N2O emissions can be effectively reduced by controlling the groundwater table in agricultural fields in the North China Plain. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Optimizing maize straw return enhances wheat yield and nitrogen use efficiency while reducing N2O emissions. Crop straw return can not only affect soil fertility & crop productivity, but also influence nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the optimal straw return methods that ensure high yield and NUE (grain yield/total N uptake, %) with less N2O emissions remain inadequately understood. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment in the North China Plain to investigate the integrated effects of maize straw return on wheat yield, NUE and N2O emissions with five treatments: straw removal (CK), straw mulch (SM), straw mixed evenly into the 0-10 cm soil layer (SR10), straw mixed evenly into the 0-20 cm soil layer (SR20), and straw mixed evenly with the 0-10 cm soil and then the mixture incorporated into the 10-20 cm soil layer (TB). Results showed that maize straw return significantly increased wheat yield compared to straw mulch, with the method of TB achieving the highest yield (10.63 Mg ha(-1)) and NUE (32.97). TB also improved soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N (TN) at the 10-20 cm soil layer, with TN increased by 24.89 % on average compared with SM, promoting soil N uptake by wheat plant and reducing N2O emissions. Conversely, straw mulch or mixed into 0-10 cm soil layer triggered cumulative N2O emissions by 22.33 % and 20.39 % compared to TB, respectively, particularly during the early growing stages, due to enhanced nitrification microbial activity and reduced substrate supply for denitrification. TB reduced yield-scaled N2O emissions by 27.6-29.4 % compared with straw mulch. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that effects of straw return on soil chemical properties (r = 0.37, P < 0.001) and denitrification microbial activity (r = 0.62, P < 0.001) were key drivers of N2O emissions. These findings highlight that stratified incorporation of straw-soil mixtures is a promising strategy to balance wheat yield, NUE, and N2O mitigation in intensive wheat-maize cropping systems in the North China Plain.

Concentration profiles of CH4, CO2 and N2O in soils of a wheat-maize rotation ecosystem in North China Plain, measured weekly over a whole year. Agricultural soils are main sources and sinks of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The source-sink function depends on soil characteristics, climate and management. Emission measurements usually quantify the net result of production, consumption and transport of these gases in the soil; they do not provide information about the depth distributions of the concentrations of these gases in the soil. Here we report on concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O in air of 300 cm deep soil profiles, at resolutions of 30-50 cm, over a full year. Gas samples were taken weekly in a long-term field experiment with an irrigated winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system, and four fertilizer N application rates (0, 200, 400 and 600 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). The results showed distinct differences in CH4, CO2 and N2O concentrations profiles with soil depth. The concentrations of CO2 in soil air increased with soil depth and showed a seasonal pattern with relatively high concentrations in the warm and moist maize growing season and relatively low concentrations in the winter-wheat growing season. In contrast, CH4 concentrations decreased with depth, and did not show a distinct seasonal cycle. Urea application did not have a large effect on CH4 or CO2 concentrations, neither in the topsoil nor the subsoil. Concentrations of N2O responded to N fertilizer application and irrigation. Application of fertilizer strongly increased grain and straw yields of both winter wheat and summer maize, relatively to the control, but differences in yield between the treatments N200, N400 and N600 were not statistically significant. However, it significantly increased mean N2O concentrations peaks at basically all soil depths. Interestingly, concentrations of N2O increased almost instantaneously in the whole soil profile, which indicates that the soil had a relatively high diffusivity, despite compacted subsoil layers. In conclusion, the frequent measurements, at high depth resolutions, of concentrations of CH4, CO2 and N2O in soil air under a winter wheat-summer maize double crop rotation provide detailed insight into the production, consumption and transport of these gases in the soil. Concentrations of CH4, CO2 and N2O responded differently to management activities and weather conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. C1 [Wang, Y. Y.; Hu, C. S.; Ming, H.; Zhang, Y.

Biogas slurry application could potentially reduce N2O emissions and increase crop yield. The huge excrement quantity from the increasing large-scale livestock stressed the ecological, environmental deterioration. As a major benefit for handling livestock manure, the slurry of biogas (BS) is developed during the production of biogas that might increase plant productivity. However, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from BS are considered a significant danger to the environment due to global warming potential. Furthermore, applying different proportions of BS combined with chemical fertilizer (CF) on N2O productions in the North China Plain (NCP) remains unclear. Herein, two sequential field trials were performed by maize-wheat rotations to substitute the CF by BS and reduce N2O emissions while keeping the crop yield stable. Four treatments were conducted, including T1, T3, T6, and CK. A total of 226.5 kg N ha(-1) used in the maize-wheat rotation system. Additionally, different ratios of BS (100%, 80%, and 50%) combined with CF were used in wheat season in the tillering stage. Results showed integrated applications of BS with CF have potential for reducing N2O emission. Our findings showed that the maximum grain yield of CF was 6250 kg ha(-1), which might be achieved by applying 38% BS and 62% of CF. This ratio yielded 1.03 kg ha(-1) N2O emissions, which was 15% lesser than the N2O emission of CK, 1.21 kg ha(-1). Considering whole growing period of wheat biogas treatments significantly reduced the cumulative N2O emissions from 17% to 26% compared to CF. To achieve maximum yield and minimum N2O emissions, an optimum 38% BS ratio has been suggested. The integrated use of BS and CF provided the greatest grain yield because of necessary nutrients provided by both slurry and CF. Consequently, N2O emissions reduced based on frequency and type of fertilizer. In conclusion, 38% ratio of BS combined with 62% CF would be a suitable approach to mitigate N2O emission and simultaneously increase crop yield in NCP. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of urease and nitrification inhibitors on nitrous oxide emissions and nitrifying/denitrifying microbial communities in a rainfed maize soil: A 6-year field observation. Application of the inhibitor-amended nitrogen fertilizers is a recommended method for reducing agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. However, the potential impacts of these inhibitors on soil environments still needs to be evaluated using long-term experiments. Through a 6-year field observation, the effects of combined application of a nitrification inhibitor (dicyandiamide, DCD) and a urease inhibitor (hydroquinone, HQ) on N2O emission, as well as soil ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in a maize (Zea mays L.) field in Northeast China were investigated. The results showed that annual soil N2O emissions were 0.466, 1.021 and 0.874 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for N0 fertilizer treatment (CK), Urea treatment (U) and Urea + DCD + HQ treatment (UDH), respectively. A significant linear correlation was found between the N2O accumulation in the first month after fertilizer application and the short-term precipitation (i.e., a period from 10 days before to 20 days after fertilizer application). The N2O emissions in the freeze-thaw period accounted for up to 42.5% of the year-round N2O emissions. The remarkable fluctuations of annual N2O emissions were observed (their coefficients of variation were 68.3%, 77.7% and 71.2% for CK, U and UDH treatments, respectively); these fluctuations were mainly attributed to the precipitation. The averaged N2O emission factors (EF) (0.308% and 0.227% for U and UDH treatments, respectively) were far less than the default mean EF of 1% proposed by (IPCC, 2006). An averaged N2O mitigation of 26.4% was fulfilled by UDH application. The results of quantitative PCR for soil nitrification and denitrification gene copy numbers measurement showed that UDH treatment significantly decreased the ammonia oxidation bacteria (AOB) amoA gene copy numbers by 74% on the 10th day after UDH application. No significant effects of combined application of DCD and HQ on microbial denitrification functional gene abundance were observed.

Integrated management practices significantly affect N2O emissions and wheat-maize production at field scale in the North China Plain. In the North China Plain, a field experiment was conducted to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes from a typical winter wheat-summer maize rotation system under five integrated agricultural management practices: conventional regime [excessive nitrogen (N) fertilization, flood irrigation, and rotary tillage before wheat sowing; CON], recommended regime 1 (balanced N fertilization, decreased irrigation, and deep plowing before wheat sowing; REC-1), recommended regime 2 (balanced N fertilization, decreased irrigation, and no tillage; REC-2), recommended regime 3 (controlled release N fertilizer, decreased irrigation, and no tillage; REC-3), and no N fertilizer (CK). Field measurements indicated that pulse emissions after N fertilization and irrigation contributed 19-49 % of annual N2O emissions. In contrast to CON (2.21 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1)), the other treatments resulted in significant declines in cumulative N2O emissions, which ranged from 0.96 to 1.76 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1), indicating that the recommended practices (e.g., balanced N fertilization, controlled release N fertilizer, and decreased irrigation) offered substantial benefits for both sustaining grain yield and reducing N2O emissions. Emission factors of N fertilizer were 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, and 0.37 % under CON, REC-1, REC-3, and REC-2, respectively. Emissions of N2O during the freeze-thaw cycle period and the winter freezing period accounted for 9.7 and 5.1 % of the annual N2O budget, respectively. Thus, we recommend that the monitoring frequency should be increased during the freeze-thaw cycle period to obtain a proper estimate of total emissions. Annual CH4 fluxes from the soil were low (-1.54 to -1.12 kg CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1)), and N fertilizer application had no obvious effects on CH4 uptake. Values of global warming potential were predominantly determined by N2O emissions, which were 411 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) in the CK and 694-982 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) in the N fertilization regimes. When comprehensively considering grain yield, global warming potential intensity values in REC-1, REC-2, and REC-3 were significantly lower than in CON. Meanwhile, grain yield increased slightly under REC-1 and REC-3 compared to CON. Generally, REC-1 and REC-3 are recommended as promising management regimes to attain the dual objectives of sustaining grain yield and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the North China Plain.

Effect of long-term compost and inorganic fertilizer application on background N2O and fertilizer-induced N2O emissions from an intensively cultivated soil. The influence of inorganic fertilizer and compost on background nitrous oxide (N2O) and fertilizer-induced N2O emissions were examined over a maize-wheat rotation year from June 2008 to May 2009 in a fluvo-aquic soil in Henan Province of China where a field experiment had been established in 1989 to evaluate the long-term effects of manure and fertilizer on soil organic status. The study involved five treatments: compost (OM), fertilizer NPK (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium, NPK), half compost N plus half fertilizer N (HUM), fertilizer NK (NK), and control without any fertilizer (CK). The natural logarithms of the background N2O fluxes were significantly (P<0.05) correlated with soil temperature, but not with soil moisture, during the maize or wheat growing season. The 18-year application of compost alone and inorganic fertilizer not only significantly (P<0.05) increased soil organic carbon (SOC) by 152% and 10-43% (respectively), but also increased background N2O emissions by 106% and 48-76% (respectively) compared with the control. Total N in soils was a better indicator for predicting annual background N2O emission than SOC. The estimated emission factor (EF) of mineralized N, calculated by dividing annual N2O emission by mineralized N was 0.13-0.19%, significantly (P<0.05) lower than the EF of added N (0.30-0.39%). The annual N2O emission in the NPK, HUM and OM soils amended with 300 kg ha(-1) organic or inorganic N was 1427, 1325 and 1178 g N ha(-1), respectively. There was a significant (P<0.05) difference between the NPK and OM. The results of this study indicate that soil indigenous N was less efficiently converted into N2O compared with exogenous N. Increasing SOC by compost application, then partially increasing N supply to crops instead of adding inorganic N fertilizer, may be an effective measure to mitigate N2O emissions from arable soils in the North China plain.

Nitrous Oxide Emission and Denitrifier Abundance in Two Agricultural Soils Amended with Crop Residues and Urea in the North China Plain. The application of crop residues combined with Nitrogen (N) fertilizer has been broadly adopted in China. Crop residue amendments can provide readily available C and N, as well as other nutrients to agricultural soils, but also intensify the N fixation, further affecting N2O emissions. N2O pulses are obviously driven by rainfall, irrigation and fertilization. Fertilization before rainfall or followed by flooding irrigation is a general management practice for a wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain. Yet, little is known on the impacts of crop residues combined with N fertilizer application on N2O emission under high soil moisture content. A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of two crop residue amendments (maize and wheat), individually or in combination with N fertilizer, on N2O emissions and denitrifier abundance in two main agricultural soils (one is an alluvial soil, pH 8.55, belongs to Ochri-Aquic Cambosols, OAC, the other is a lime concretion black soil, pH 6.61, belongs to Hapli-Aquic Vertosols, HAV) under 80% WFPS (the water filled pore space) in the North China Plain. Each type soil contains seven treatments: a control with no N fertilizer application (CK, N0), 200 kg N ha(-1) (N200), 250 kg N ha(-1) (N250), maize residue plus N200 (MN200), maize residue plus N250 (MN250), wheat residue plus N200 (WN200) and wheat residue plus N250 (WN250). Results showed that, in the HAV soil, MN250 and WN250 increased the cumulative N2O emissions by 60% and 30% compared with N250 treatment, respectively, but MN200 and WN200 decreased the cumulative N2O emissions by 20% and 50% compared with N200. In the OAC soil, compared with N200 or N250, WN200 and WN250 increased the cumulative N2O emission by 40%-50%, but MN200 and MN250 decreased the cumulative N2O emission by 10%-20%. Compared with CK, addition of crop residue or N fertilizer resulted in significant increases in N2O emissions in both soils. The cumulative N2O emissions from the treatments of 250 kg N ha(-1) were 1.1-3.3 times higher than those of treatments with 200 kg N ha(-1) in both soils with adding equal amounts of the same type of crop residue. Abundance of the 16S rRNA gene did not significantly change in all treatments in two soils, but the nosZ and nirS genes were more abundant in soils amended with crop residues compared with CK or N-only treatments. N2O emission, however, were not related to the abundance of denitrifier containing nirS or nosZ. The research provided some information regarding the effect of crop residues with N fertilizer on N2O emissions and denitrifier abundances in two soils. Our results imply the property of crop residue and rate of N fertilizer are important influencing factors of N2O emission when crop residues combined with N fertilizer are applied to different agricultural soils.

Assessing the impacts of climate change on crop yields, soil organic carbon sequestration and N2O emissions in wheat-maize rotation systems. Straw retention has been widely implemented to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and green-house gas (GHG) mitigation for global agriculture. However, the combined effects of long-term straw retention on crop production, SOC sequestration and GHG emissions response to climate change remain unknown. Two nearby wheat-maize rotation field experiments in the North China Plain, combined with local weather, soil and agronomic measurements, were used to evaluate the applicability of the SPACSYS model. The model was then applied to assess the response of crop yield, SOC storage and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to three nitrogen fertilizer application levels (100, 200, 400 kg N ha(-1)) and three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) under straw retention for the wheat-maize rotation systems during 2021-2100. In general, the model was reasonably accurate with R-2 and model efficiency (EF) ranging from 0.25 to 0.96 and 0.32-0.94, respectively. Climate change decreased wheat yield by 4-39%, while maize showed a slight increase (3%) under RCP2.6 and a decrease of 1-15% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The SOC storage in the 0-20 cm soil increased at a rate of 73-195 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) but decreased within the upper 1 m soil at 280-390 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Climate change reduced the positive effect of SOC sequestration except in RCP2.6 and stimulated substantial N2O emissions ranging from 1-7.5 to 2.9-23.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), consequently, the global warming potential increased from -79-2555 to 548-9357 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) under various N fertilizer application levels. This study reveals that the negative feedback under climate change with modelling approach, and extensive efforts are needed to make adaptations to ensure food production and reduce GHG emissions in the future.

Maize stalk incorporation increases N2O emissions that offset the benefit of SOC sequestration in a winter wheat-summer maize field: A four-year measurement in long-term fertilizer experiments. Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and net global warming potential (GWP) are variable following crop residue retention in agroecosystems. We measured the SOC content (from 1990 to 2018) and N2O fluxes (from October 2014 to September 2018) in a long-term fertilizer experiment with winter wheat-summer maize rotation (since 1990) in the Guanzhong Plain. The primary aim was to quantify the effects of maize stalk incorporation on N2O emissions, SOC sequestration (SOCSR), and net GWP during the measurement period. We examined two fertilizer management practices, i.e., synthetic fertilizers in both crop seasons (NF) and synthetic fertilizers in both crop seasons with maize stalk incorporation in the winter wheat season (NFS), and an unfertilized control (CK). Annual N2O emissions ranged from 0.11 to 0.27 kg N ha(- 1 ) yr(-1) in CK. Fertilization significantly increased N2O emissions (p < 0.001), with values ranging from 1.65 to 5.65 and 3.08 to 7.85 kg N ha(- 1 ) yr(- 1 ) in NF and NFS, respectively. The emissions from NFS were 27-253% higher than those from NF, with significant differences (p < 0.05) during three out of four experimental years. The SOC contents linearly increased with the experimental year (p < 0.001), giving SOCSRs of 0.13, 0.45 and 0.60 t C ha(- 1 ) yr(- 1 ) in CK, NF and NFS, respectively. The net GWP averaged - 0.38, - 0.36, and 0.01 t CO2 equivalent ha(- 1 )yr(- 1 )in the three treatments, denoting that NFS was a minor greenhouse gas source during the measurement period. This study provided evidence that maize stalk incorporation increased both N2O emissions and SOC sequestration, while the N2O emissions offset the benefit of SOC sequestration. We conclude that maize stalk incorporation does not appear to be an effective approach to decrease net greenhouse gas emissions from the winter wheat-summer maize rotation in the Guanzhong Plain. This issue can probably be resolved by avoiding fertilizer application to wet soil in the winter wheat season and/or returning winter wheat straw in the summer maize season.

Nitrous oxide and methane emissions from optimized and alternative cereal cropping systems on the North China Plain: A two-year field study. The impacts of different crop rotation systems with their corresponding management practices on grain yield, greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer nitrogen (N) and irrigation water use efficiencies are not well documented. This holds especially for the North China Plain which provides the staple food for hundreds of millions of people and where groundwater resources are polluted with nitrate and depleted through irrigation. Here, we report on fertilizer N and irrigation water use, grain yields, and nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions of conventional and optimized winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping systems, and of three alternative cropping systems, namely a winter wheat-summer maize (or soybean)-spring maize system, with three harvests in two years; and a single spring maize system with one crop per year. The results of this two-year study show that the optimized double-cropping system led to a significant increase in grain yields and a significant decrease in fertilizer N use and net greenhouse gas intensity, but the net greenhouse gas N2O emissions plus CH4 uptake and the use of irrigation water did not decrease relative to the conventional system. Compared to the conventional system the net greenhouse gas emissions, net greenhouse gas intensity and use of fertilizer N and irrigation water decreased in the three alternative cropping systems, but at the cost of grain yields except in the winter wheat-summer maize-spring maize system. Net uptake of CH4 by the soil was little affected by cropping system. Average N2O emission factors were only 0.17% for winter wheat and 0.53% for maize. In conclusion, the winter wheat-summer maize-spring maize system has considerable potential to decrease water and N use and decrease N2O emissions while maintaining high grain yields and sustainable use of groundwater.

Greenhouse gas emissions and crop-specific emission factors of eight upland crops based on a six-year field experiment in the North China Plain. Nitrous oxide is a significant greenhouse gas (GHG) contributor in crop production, yet detailed documentation, including crop yields and specific emission factors (EFd d of N2O), 2 O), are lacking for the North China Plain. A six-year (2016-2022) diversified crop rotation experiment in this region examined GHG emissions from eight crops (sweet potato, peanut, soybean, spring maize, sweet sorghum, ryegrass, summer maize, and winter wheat) and fallow seasons. The results revealed that summer maize had the highest cumulative soil N2O 2 O emissions (5.07 kg N ha- 1 ), with an average flux value of 225.3 mu g N2O-N 2 O-N m- 2 h- 1 during the growing season. Summer maize emitted 16-75 % more N2O 2 O than spring crops and winter wheat and 85-86 % more than ryegrass (cover crop) and the winter fallow season. All eight crops acted as weak net CH4 4 sinks. Annual average CO2-equivalents 2-equivalents of N2O 2 O and CH4 4 emissions reflected N2O 2 O emissions from all crops and fallow seasons. In addition, GHG footprint metrics (GFa, a , per unit area; GFy, y , per kg equivalent yield; GFb, b , per kg biomass; GFe, e , per unit economic benefit) based on life cycle assessment thinking showed that intensive cereal crops (winter wheat and summer maize) had the highest GHG footprints, while sweet potato had the lowest due to its greater biomass and lower N input. Other crops had 19-90 % lower GHG footprints than wheat and maize. Furthermore, we also quantified specific- crop EFd d of N2O, 2 O, with ryegrass having the lowest EFd d (0.48 f 0.02 %), followed by winter wheat (0.81 f 0.43 %), and other crops ranging from 1.00 f 0.13 % to 2.36 f 0.85 %. This study provides important emissions data for different crops and winter fallow periods, enhancing our understanding of GHG footprints and emission factors, which are essential for the advancement of sustainable agriculture practices.

Nitrous oxide emission and nitrogen use efficiency in response to nitrophosphate, N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide and dicyandiamide of a wheat cultivated soil under sub-humid monsoon conditions. A field experiment was designed to study the effects of nitrogen (N) source and urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) or nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and N use efficiency (NUE) in a sandy loam soil. Six treatments including no N fertilizer (control), N fertilizer urea alone (U), urea plus NBPT (NBPT), urea plus DCD (DCD), urea plus NBPT and DCD (NBPT plus DCD) and nitrate-based fertilizer nitrophosphate (NP) were designed and implemented separately during the wheat growth period. Seasonal cumulative N2O emissions with urea alone amounted to 0.49 +/- 0.12 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced to 0.28 +/- 0.03, 0.31 +/- 0.01 and 0.26 +/- 0.01 kg N2O-N ha(-1) by application of DCD, NBPT and NBPT plus DCD, respectively. Cumulative N2O emissions from NP were 0.28 +/- 0.01 kg N2O-N ha(-1). A single N2O flux peak was identified following basal fertilization, and DCD and/or NBPT inhibition effects mainly occurred during the peak emission period. The NP application significantly (P < 0.05) increased wheat yield by 12.3% and NUE from 28.8%(urea alone) to 35.9 %, while urease and/or nitrification inhibitors showed a slight increase effect. Our results clearly indicated that the application of urea as basal fertilizer, but not as supplemental fertilizer, together with DCD and NBPT is an effective practice to reduce N2O emissions. The application of NP instead of urea would be an optimum agricultural strategy for reducing N2O emissions and increasing crop yield and NUE for wheat cultivation in soils of the North China Plain.

Eight years organic amendment application alters N2O emission potential by increasing soil O2 consumption rate. Organic amendments are efficient measures that can be employed to increase both nitrogen use efficiency and soil organic carbon (SOC) content. However, the long-term effects of such measures on soil N2O emission and the associated underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we sampled soils that were part of two long-term trials after eight years of different amounts and types of organic amendment addition, and investigated the response of soil N2O emissions to different types of mineral N addition under oxic condition. Further, we selected two soil samples with a large difference in SOC content and investigated the responses of soil CO2, N2O, NO, and N-2 emissions as well as O-2 consumption to NH4+, NO3-, and nitrification inhibitor addition under limited O-2 diffusion condition and anoxic condition. Results showed that long-term organic amendments significantly increased SOC content, while the stimulated effect on N2O and N-2 emissions owing to increased SOC contents was more pronounced with NH4+ addition under limited O-2 diffusion condition than under oxic or anoxic conditions. Further, in all treatments under limited O-2 diffusion condition, soil O-2 concentration and N2O production showed significant inverse relationships, suggesting that O-2 directly regulates N2O production. We speculated that the decrease in O-2 availability with higher SOC contents owing to enhanced soil respiration, instead of the increased supply of electron donors, is primarily responsible for the stimulated N2O emissions. This implied that practices which reduce limited O-2 diffusion conditions might help to minimize the stimulated N2O emissions from increased SOC content. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Food benefit and climate warming potential of nitrogen fertilizer uses in China. Chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer has long been used to help meet the increasing food demands in China, the top N fertilizer consumer in the world. Growing concerns have been raised on the impacts of N fertilizer uses on food security and climate change, which is lack of quantification. Here we use a carbon-nitrogen (C-N) coupled ecosystem model, to quantify the food benefit and climate consequence of agronomic N addition in China over the six decades from 1949 to 2008. Results show that N fertilizer-induced crop yield and soil C sequestration had reached their peaks, while nitrous oxide (N2O) emission continued rising as N was added. Since the early 2000s, stimulation of excessive N fertilizer uses to global climate warming through N2O emission was estimated to outweigh their climate benefit in increasing CO2 uptake. The net warming effect of N fertilizer uses, mainly centered in the North China Plain and the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River Basin, with N2O emission completely counteracting or even exceeding, by more than a factor of 2, the CO2 sink. If we reduced the current N fertilizer level by 60% in 'over-fertilized' areas, N2O emission would substantially decrease without significantly influencing crop yield and soil C sequestration.

Denitrification-Nitrate Driven N2O Uptake by Fluvisols With Low-N Fertiliser Is an Overlooked Sink of N2O. The frequent observation of negative N2O fluxes reveals a significant but overlooked soil sink, yet its potential and mechanisms under zero nitrogen (N) fertilisation remain unclear, since high-N fertiliser application induced N2O emission pulses generally obscured the role of N2O uptake. To explore the uptake potentials and driving mechanisms under zero-N fertilisation, a 3-year in situ field study (from June 2013 to May 2016) on maize-wheat rotation systems in the North China Plain was conducted, using high-resolution sampling of N2O fluxes and meteorological metadata (fluxes were every 2-3 days) and biological analysis (measured in 2015-2016). The results showed that contrasting patterns of N2O emissions between the wheat season (-492.6 g N ha-1) and maize season (443.5 g N ha-1) were recorded, and the N2O sink of the wheat season was 1.10 times that of the N2O source from the maize season during the whole experiment. Further analysis of predictor variables identified that temperature, nitrate content and nosZ abundances were the key explanatory variables for N2O uptake by wheat field soils, while denitrification, nitrate content and relatively higher abundances of AOA, AOB, NOB, nirS and/or nirK characterised maize soils. Therefore, a probable mechanism for N2O uptake by wheat field soils was that, during the wheat season, typical low temperatures extremely restricted microbial denitrification activities and decreased nitrate substrate accessibility. Moreover, higher temperature and anoxic conditions within subsurface soils provided more helpful conditions for microbial conversion of N2O to N2 with greater nosZ gene abundances. Overall, this study characterised a significantly underestimated N2O sink in the wheat season with zero-N fertilisation. These findings contribute to modifying the conventional understanding that cropland soil is always a major source of N2O emissions to the atmosphere, and also provide new insight for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation under the dual carbon strategy.

Maize-soybean intercropping reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the fertilized soil in the North China Plain. Background and Aim Continuous monocropping with high nitrogen (N) fertilizer input substantially increases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in maize-based agroecosystems in the North China Plain (NCP). Introducing soybeans as an intercrop with maize and partially substituting urea with manure might effectively decrease GHG emissions. The aim of this study was to quantify the synergistic effect of maize-soybean intercropping and manure on soil GHG emissions. Methods A two-year field experiment with three cropping systems (maize monocrop, soybean monocrop, and maize-soybean intercrop) and four N treatments (control, urea, manure, and manure + urea) was carried out at Luancheng Agro-Ecosystem Experimental Station in the NCP. All N treatments, except the control, received 150 kg N ha(-1)season(-1), either full dose as a basal application or two equal split applications. Results Results showed that all treatments contributed as a net source of N2O and CO2 fluxes but acted as a net sink of CH4 fluxes. In both cropping seasons, intercrops had significantly lower N2O emissions compared to monocropping systems, with 38% and 14% less emissions than maize monocrops in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, maize monocrops had significantly higher soil CO2 emissions than other systems, while maize-soybean intercropping had 12% and 13% less CO2 emissions than maize monocrops in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Among fertilized treatments, manure-treated soils emit notably lower N2O fluxes compared to sole urea treatments. In this study, N2O and CO2 fluxes had a strong positive correlation with soil mineral N concentrations, soil temperature, and moisture content. Possibly due to more efficient N utilization, intercrop soils exhibited significantly lower NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, leading to reduced nitrification and denitrification in the system, resulting in lower N2O emissions from maize-soybean intercrops. Conclusion Our findings indicate that intercropping maize and soybean reduces soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, as well as significantly decreasing soil N2O and CO2 emissions when compared to traditional maize monoculture. Therefore, due to its potential for reducing soil GHG emissions, maize-soybean intercropping can be regarded as an effective alternative cropping system to the prevailing maize-dominant monoculture to develop a sustainable agroecosystem in the NCP region.

Linkage between N2O emission and functional gene abundance in an intensively managed calcareous fluvo-aquic soil. The linkage between N2O emissions and the abundance of nitrifier and denitrifier genes is unclear in the intensively managed calcareous fluvo-aquic soils of the North China Plain. We investigated the abundance of bacterial amoA for nitrification and narG, nirS, nirK, and nosZ for denitrification by in situ soil sampling to determine how the abundance of these genes changes instantly during N fertilization events and is related to high N2O emission peaks. We also investigated how long-term incorporated straw and/or manure affect(s) the abundance of these genes based on a seven-year field experiment. The overall results demonstrate that the long-term application of urea-based fertilizer and/or manure significantly enhanced the number of bacterial amoA gene copies leading to high N2O emission peaks after N fertilizer applications. These peaks contributed greatly to the annual N2O emissions in the crop rotation. A significant correlation between annual N2O emissions and narG, nirS, and nirK gene numbers indicates that the abundance of these genes is related to N2O emission under conditions for denitrification, thus partly contributing to the annual N2O emissions. These findings will help to draw up appropriate measures for mitigation of N2O emissions in this `hotspot' region.

Short-Term Effects of Partial Substitution of Mineral Fertilisers With Compost and Biogas Slurry on Carbon Dioxide, Nitrous Oxide, and Nitrogen Emissions. Compost and biogas slurry are increasingly used as organic fertilisers, but existing studies on their application on soil N2O emissions have been contradictory, studies on soil N2 emissions are lacking, and the mechanism of microbial control of gaseous N loss is unclear. This study investigated the effects of partially replacing mineral fertilisers with compost (30%) and biogas slurry (50%) on CO2, N2O, and N2 emissions, alongside soil nitrogen-cycling microbial communities in no nitrogen application (LN) and 600 kg N ha-1 year-1 fertilisation (HN) soils from China's North China Plain. Through controlled incubation experiments, gas flux measurements, and metagenomic analysis, we found that in the first 5 days of fertilised treatments, N2O emissions accounted for 85.26% and 94.18%, while N2 emissions accounted for 71.25% and 68.78% of total emissions under LN and HN, respectively. Organic substitutions reduced soil mineral nitrogen (-N) content by limiting exogenous nitrogen input and suppressing native organic matter mineralisation, thereby decreasing pulse emissions of N2O, N2, and CO2. While both substitutions promoted complete denitrification, biogas slurry at 50% substitution significantly enhanced nitrifying microbe abundance (Nitrosospira, Nitrospira) and nitrification-related functional genes (AmoC and Hao), increasing nitrification-driven N2O emissions compared to compost. For sustainable management, high-fertility soils benefit from partial substitution of mineral fertiliser with compost, whereas low-fertility soils require substitution ratios of biogas slurry for mineral fertiliser to boost microbial activity. These findings provide critical insights for optimising organic substitution strategies to balance productivity and environmental sustainability in intensive agricultural systems.

Modelling impacts of alternative farming management practices on greenhouse gas emissions from a winter wheat-maize rotation system in China. Agricultural production plays an important role in affecting atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Field measurements were conducted in Quzhou County, Hebei Province in the North China Plains to quantify carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a winter wheat-maize rotation field, a common cropping system across the Chinese agricultural regions. The observed flux data in conj. unction with the local climate, soil and management information were utilized to test a process-based model, Denitrification-Decomposition or DNDC, for its applicability for the cropping system. The validated DNDC was then used for predicting impacts of three management alternatives (i.e., no-till, increased crop residue incorporation and reduced fertilizer application rate) on CO2 and N2O emissions from the target field. Results from the simulations indicated that (1) CO2 emissions were significantly affected by temperature, initial SOC, tillage method, and quantity and quality of the organic matter added in the soils; (2) increases in temperature, initial SOC, total fertilizer N input, and manure amendment substantially increased N2O emissions; and (3) temperature, initial SOC, tillage, and quantity and quality of the organic matter added in the soil all had significant effects on global warming. Finally, five 50-year scenarios were simulated with DNDC to predict their long-term impacts on crop yield, soil C dynamics, nitrate leaching losses, and N2O emissions. The modelled results suggested that implementation of manure amendment or crop residue incorporation instead of increased fertilizer application rates would more efficiently mitigate GHG emissions from the tested agro-ecosystem. The multi-impacts provided a Sound basis for comprehensive assessments on the management alternatives. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Contrasting effects of biochar- and organic fertilizer-amendment on community compositions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in a wheat-maize rotation system. This research investigated the N2O fluxes and community compositions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system on the North China Plain. The experiment included three treatments: 1) a control treatment (CK); 2) biochar at 10.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (C); and 3) organic fertilizer at 7.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (M). The application of biochar reduced the cumulative N2O emissions by 47.7% and 62.2% in the maize and wheat seasons, respectively, compared with those of the CK treatment. Organic fertilizer increased the cumulative N2O emissions by 311.1% in the maize season and had no significant effects on them in the wheat season. Organic fertilizer reduced the cumulative N2O emissions by 39.8% in the nonfertilizer period of the maize season. The cumulative N2O emissions in the maize season accounted for 75.2-90.0% of the annual emissions among all the treatments. Biochar and organic fertilizer affected soil N2O emissions mainly by changing soil denitrifiers. In the maize season, the lower abundances of Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum (AOA-amoA), Nitrosomonas (AOB-amoA), Mesorhizobium (nirK), Magnetospirillum (nirS) and Halomonas (nirS) may result in lower N2O emissions in the biochar treatment, and organic fertilizer had a similar influencing mechanism on N2O emissions during the nonbasic fertilizer and nontopdressing periods of the maize season. In the wheat season, the dominant genus Alicycliphilus (nosZ) was the major contributor to decreasing N2O emissions in the biochar treatment, while there was no biomarker related to N2O emissions in the M treatment. The soil pH, NO3--N content and water-filled pore space (WFPS) were the key factors shifting the community compositions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in this study. The application of biochar could be a better practice to improve saline-alkali soil with lower N2O emissions. These findings will improve our understanding of the nitrifiers and denitrifiers response to biochar and organic fertilizer.

Greenhouse gas emissions from soils A review. Soils act as sources and sinks for greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Since both storage and emission capacities may be large, precise quantifications are needed to obtain reliable global budgets that are necessary for land-use management (agriculture, forestry), global change and for climate research. This paper discusses exclusively the soil emission related processes and their influencing parameters. It reviews soil emission studies involving the most important land-cover types and climate zones and introduces important measuring systems for soil emissions. It addresses current shortcomings and the obvious bias towards northern hemispheric data. When using a conservative average of 300 mg CO(2)e m(-2) h(-1) (based on our literature review), this leads to global annual net soil emissions of >= 350 Pg CO(2)e (CO(2)e = CO2 equivalents = total effect of all GHG normalized to CO2). This corresponds to roughly 21% of the global soil C and N pools. For comparison, 33.4 Pg CO2 are being emitted annually by fossil fuel combustion and the cement industry. (C) 2016 The Authors.

INTERCROPPING WITH LEGUMES ON NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) EMISSIONS. EFFECTS OF MAIZE (ZEA MAYS L.) INTERCROPPING WITH LEGUMES ON NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) EMISSIONS. To investigate the effects of maize/legume intercropping on soil N2O emissions, six treatments were tested in the North China Plain: maize, M120 (N application rate 120 kg ha-1); maize, M240 (N application rate 240 kg ha-1); soybean (Glycine max), SS (120 kg ha-1); maize/soybean intercropping, MS (120 kg ha-1); peanut (Arachis hypogaea), PP (120 kg ha-1); and maize/peanut intercropping, MP (120 kg ha-1). The amounts of inorganic nitrogen for the 0-20 cm soil in MS were 24.0%, 5.3%, and 29.3% lower than in SS, M120, and M240, respectively (P < 0.05). The total N2O emissions ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.09 to 0.98 +/- 0.14 kg ha-1. MP and MS were statistically different at the 95% confidence level, whereas MP produced the least N2O emissions at 0.41 kg ha-1. The seasonal cumulative N2O emissions and global warming potential in MS and MP were also significantly lower than those in the other three monoculture treatments (P < 0.001). The results demonstrated that maize/legume intercropping can increase the N uptake of crops and reduce the amount of soil inorganic nitrogen and N2O emissions, thereby, ensuring the sustainability of the agricultural environment.

Effect of deficit irrigation on soil CO2 and N2O emissions and winter wheat yield. Determining the features of soil CO2 and N2O emissions and the driving factors of deficit irrigation is of great significance for optimizing cropland management modes. In this study, the experimental plots were selected in a typical area of the North China Plain during the whole growth period of winter wheat. Six irrigation levels were designed to investigate the effect of deficit irrigation on CO2 and N2O emissions and wheat yield. CK represents reference irrigation (full-water irrigation), and T1-T5 represent irrigation water decreasing by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%, respectively. The experiment showed that soil CO2 and N2O emissions decreased under the deficit irrigation treatments (T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5). Pearson correlation analysis showed that there were significant correlations between the CO2 emissions and soil temperature or water-filled pore space (WFPS) under the different irrigation treatments, and these correlations had a significant linear relationship. However, there was no discernible correlation between the N2O emissions and soil temperature or WFPS under the other irrigation treatments except the CK treatment. Compared with that of the CK treatment, the equivalent CO2 of the T1-T5 treatments decreased by 8.6%, 5.7%, 14.3%, 14.1% and 19.3%, respectively. Compared with the CK treatment, the T3-T5 treatments significantly decreased the N2O emissions (P < 0.05), and the reduction in CO2 by deficit irrigation did not reach a significant level (P > 0.05). Moreover, some deficit irrigation treatments had negative influences on the yield of winter wheat. Through the TOPSIS method and RSR method, the effects of the irrigation levels on equivalent CO2 and wheat yield were evaluated comprehensively. The T3 treatment was shown to be the best irrigation level for the conservation of wheat yield and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the corresponding irrigation water amount under the T3 treatment could be regarded as the most appropriate scheme. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

[1] Soil denitrification fluxes and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the soil surface simulated by a Water and Nitrogen Management Model (WNMM), with three different gas modules, are compared to measurement data sets from two irrigated wheat-maize systems at two locations in the North China Plain (NCP) ( 2 years of measurement at the Luancheng site and 1 year of measurement at the Fengqiu site). The three gas modules are the WNMM gas module, the DAYCENT gas module, and the DNDC gas module. The term gas module used in this paper refers to the model component which simulates N2O emission from the processes of soil nitrification and denitrification. Soil water, temperature, organic matter decomposition, other nitrogen (N) transformations, such as mineralization and immobilization, and crop growth are simulated by the WNMM platform. For the 2-year data set from Luancheng, the three gas modules generate similar soil mineral N dynamics in the 0 - 20 cm topsoil. The daily time step, simply structured WNMM gas module consistently performs the best among the three gas modules for predicting soil denitrification fluxes (R-2 = 0.28, n = 39, p = 0.0006) and N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.45, n = 36, p < 0.0001). Up to 73, 43, and 22% of total N2O emissions are nitrification-induced as simulated by the DNDC, DAYCENT, and WNMM gas modules respectively, in this well-drained loam soil during the 2-year simulation. When applied to the 1-year data set at the Fengqiu site, the WNMM gas module consistently performs better in estimating N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.54, n = 35, p < 0.0001) compared to the other two modules. Simulations using the DNDC and DAYCENT gas modules explain over 40% of the temporal variation of N2O emission from the soil. Further testing on different soils and different agroecosystems is needed to confirm the superior performance of the WNMM gas module observed in this simulation study.

Reductions in nitrous oxide emissions in diverse crop rotations linked to changes in prokaryotic community structure. Diverse crop rotations are increasingly recognized as key to address the global food crisis and improve environmental sustainability, including reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the specific effects on N2O emissions of different crops in these rotations and the underlying incidence on microbial processes remain underexplored. In a six-year field study, we compared N2O emissions from traditional wheat-maize rotation with diverse rotations, including legumes (peanut, soybean), ryegrass, sorghum, and sweet potato. We also examined the microbial functions associated with nitrogen cycling based on functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa (FAPROTAX) analysis. Our study showed that diversified crop rotations with reduced synthetic fertilization and irrigation can reduce N2O emissions by 23 %-49 % compared to conventional rotations. These reductions were supported by increases in soil organic carbon, soil carbon/nitrogen ratio and decreases in the relative abundance of denitrifying microorganisms, particularly observed in rotations with soybean and sweet potato. However, the spring maize and peanut-based rotation had higher emission factors than traditional wheat-maize rotation due to lower initial crop nitrogen uptake and lower nitrogen use efficiency, respectively. Changes in the microbial community structures of nitrification and denitrification processes, including increased activity of ammoniaoxidizing bacteria MND1 and archaea Candidatus Nitrososphaera in legume and sweet potato rotations, and a shift in denitrifying microbes of diverse rotations (a decrease in Rhodoplanes and an increase in Paracoccus), significantly contributed to the overall reductions in emissions in all other investigated rotation systems. Understanding the microbial mechanisms that control N2O emissions from agricultural soils will enable the development of more effective and crop-specific strategies to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Nitrous oxide emissions from an intensively cultivated maize-wheat rotation soil in the North China Plain. N2O emissions from a maize-wheat rotation field were monitored in the Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station (Fenaqiu County, Henan Province, China) from June 2004 to June 2005. The experiment included four treatments: a bare (crop-absent) soil treated with 150 kg N ha(-1) (WN150) and soils fertilized with 0 (N0), 150 (N 150), and 250 (N250) kg N ha(-1) and cropped with maize or wheat. The bulk of the N2O emissions occurred in pulses following the application of fertilizer N at soil temperatures of 15 degrees C or more. The application of fertilizer N significantly increased the N2O emission, from 636 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the N0 treatment to 4480 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the N250 treatment. However, this increase primarily occurred during the maize growing season. The emission factor of applied fertilizer N as N2O was 1.05-1.34% and 0.24-0.26% during the 105-day maize and 241-day wheat growing seasons, respectively, and was on average 0.61-0.77%. Increasing the rate of fertilizer application increased the emission factor during the maize growing season. The presence of maize appears to increase N2O emission by 45% versus bare soil during the maize growing season. And, N2O emission during the maize season were significantly related to CO, production (R=0.43-0.81, n=30, P < 0.05). N2O emission was greatly affected by soil moisture during the maize growing season and by soil temperature during the wheat growing season. The maximum rates of nitrification occurred when soil moisture was in the range of 45-60% WFPS, with the optimum value being approximately 50%. However, soil moisture influenced N2O emission only when the soil temperature was at the optimum level. It is suggested that reducing the application rate of basal fertilizer N during the maize growing season could decrease N2O emission. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide in water-saving rice production in North China. Lowland rice production is currently facing serious water shortages in numerous Asian countries. In the North China Plain water limitations are severe. Water-saving rice production techniques are therefore increasingly searched for. Here we present the first study of trace gas emissions from a water-saving rice production system where soils are mulched and are kept close to field capacity in order to compare their contribution to global warming with traditional paddy rice. In a two-year field experiment close to Beijing, CH4 and N2O fluxes were monitored in two forms of the Ground Cover Rice Production System (GCRPS) and in traditional paddy fields using closed chambers. With paddy rice the observed CH4 emissions were very low, about 0.3 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1) in 2001 and about 1 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1) in 2002. In GCRPS, the CH4 emissions were negligible. N2O fluxes in GCRPS were similar, 0.5 to 0.6 g N2O m(-2) a(-1) in 2001 and 2002, and emission peaks mainly followed fertilizer applications. In paddy rice, N2O fluxes were unexpectedly low throughout the year 2001 (0.03 g N2O m(-2) a(-1)), and in 2002 larger emissions occurred during the drainage period. So with 0.4 g N2O m(-2) a(-1) the cumulative flux was similar to emissions in GCRPS. Total CO2 equivalent fluxes calculated according to IPCC methodology were tenfold higher in GCRPS compared to paddy in 2001. In 2002, fluxes from both systems were similar with 175 and 141 g CO2 equivalents m(-2) a(-1) from GCRPS and paddy. C1 Univ Kiel, Inst Plant Nutr & Soil Sci, Kiel, Germany.

However, the trade-off between the economic and environmental performances of different blended fertilizer treatments for different maize varieties remains unclear. Therefore, a consecutive two-year field experiment was conducted in the North China Plain to study the effects of different ratios of CRU and common urea on the yield, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, yield-scaled total N2O emissions, greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), and net ecosystem economic benefit (NEEB) in 2021 and 2022. Four N fertilizer treatments with equal rate at 180 kg N ha(-1) were applied as N180U (all Urea), N180C1(1/3CRU), N180C2(2/3CRU), and N180C (all CRU), and two maize varieties (JNK728-yellow ripe variety and ZD958-green ripe variety) were used. The N180C1 and N180C2 treatments produced the highest grain yield in varieties JNK728 and ZD958 (9.4-11.5 t ha(-1) and 9.0-11.0 t ha(-1)), respectively. Compared to the N180U treatment (conventional method), the N180C1 treatment reduced the GHGI (24.8 %-25.9 %) and increased the NEEB (33.1 %-33.4 %) in the JNK728 variety, whereas the N180C2 treatment reduced the GHGI (16.9 %-28.8 %) and increased the NEEB (27.2 %-48.1 %) in the ZD958 variety. The study concludes that a one-time application of blended nitrogen fertilizer in suitable varieties can minimize the GHGI and maximize the NEEB, which is an effective strategy for balancing yield and nitrogen efficiency in the summer maize system in the North China Plain.

Effect of field-aged biochar on fertilizer N retention and N2O emissions: A field microplot experiment with 15N-labeled urea. Biochar application is thought to improve crop yield and reduce N leaching and gas emissions; however, little is known about how field-aged biochar affects fertilizer N retention and N2O emissions. Here, a field microplot experiment is established in the North China Plain at maize season by applying N-15-labeled urea to the sandy loam soil both with (Biochar) and without (Control) application of 3-year field-aged biochar at 12 t ha(-1). Overall, 25.6-26.2% of the urea N was taken up by maize aboveground biomass, field-aged biochar did not affect yield or fertilizer N recovery efficiency. After maize harvest, the residual ratio of applied N in the soil profile (0-40 cm) was 21.6 and 20.3% under Control and Biochar treatment, respectively, with an increase of 10.2% in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and decrease of 37.2% in the subsoil (20-40 cm) following biochar amendment, probably due to reduced NO3- leaching. Cumulative N2O emissions and urea N-induced N2O emissions under Control treatment were 2.06 and 0.78 kg N ha(-1), and significantly decreased to 1.89 and 0.74 kg N ha(-1) after Biochar treatment, respectively. N2O emissions derived from the applied N accounted for 38.0 and 39.4% of the total emissions under Control and Biochar treatment, respectively. N2O emissions from decomposition of soil organic N induced by the priming effect of the applied N was 0.69 and 0.56 kg N ha(-1) under Control and Biochar treatment, respectively, contributing 33.7 and 29.7% of the total emissions. Overall, our results suggest that field-aged biochar increased the retention of fertilizerNin the topsoil by reducing NO3 leaching, while effectively reduced N2O emissions from fertilizer N and mineralization of organic N in the sandy loam soil.

Seasonal variations in N2 and N2O emissions from a wheat-maize cropping system. The N losses via denitrification and the N-2/N2O emission ratio are highly uncertain, mainly due to methodological difficulties concerning measurement of N-2 emissions. Here, we report on seasonal measurements of N2O and N-2 emissions from the top soil of a winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping system in the North China Plain. A novel double cylinder soil core method was used to measure N2O and N-2 fluxes in situ from a 20-year field experiment with four N fertilizer treatments (0, 200, 400, and 600kgNha(-1)year(-1)) and 16 sampling occasions over a 1-year period. The N-2-free helium-oxygen atmosphere in the inter-layer between the two cylinders acted as a buffer against N-2 diffusion from the atmosphere into the soil core. Total N2O emissions were 0.44, 1.31, 2.19, and 2.23kgNha(-1)year(-1), and total N-2 emissions were 8.3, 20.0, 22.5, and 24.7kgNha(-1)year(-1) from the N0, N200, N400, and N600 treatments, respectively. The N-2/N2O emission ratio ranged from 2 to 136, indicating that N-2 was the dominant gas. The N-2/N2O ratio was much higher in summer than in winter, and was inversely related to fertilizer N application. Fluxes of N-2 were statistically related to soil temperature and concentrations of NO3--N and DOC in soil extracts, while N2O fluxes were related to soil water content and concentrations of NO3--N and exchangeable NH4+ in soil extracts. The N-2/N2O ratio was related to soil temperature and exchangeable NH4+ and NO3--N concentrations. Our study provides new insights on variations of the N-2/N2O emission ratio in agroecosystems, and shows the importance of seasonal measurements.

Greenhouse gas emissions as influenced by wetland vegetation degradation along a moisture gradient on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of North-West China. Vegetation loss and plant diversity decline in wetlands affect carbon and nitrogen cycling and consequently influence gas fluxes. Although extensive grazing by livestock and climate change have caused significant physical degradation of wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), and created a clear drainage gradient, the impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with this change has rarely been reported. A 3-year study (2013-2015) was conducted to examine the effect of vegetation change and seasonality on ecosystem respiration, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in four classes of wetlands with distinct magnitudes of vegetation degradation: healthy vegetation (HV), slightly degraded (SD), moderately degraded, and heavily degraded (HD). We used the dark static chamber-chromatography method to measure the gas fluxes. Highly degraded wetlands were larger C and GHG sources than HV, despite lower methane emissions, due to the loss of gross primary production. SD and HD exhibited the highest cumulative mean annual ecosystem respiration and N2O emissions, respectively. Ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes were much higher during the growing seasons than in the non-growing seasons. Ecosystem respiration and N2O fluxes were positively correlated with soil and air temperatures. This points at a potential effect of global warming on GHG emissions from the QTP wetlands. Top soil (0-20cm) moisture content significantly correlated positively with CH4 fluxes. Vegetation loss led to a reduced C uptake and increased global warming potential. Therefore, we recommend soil conservation measures and reduced livestock grazing in the wetlands in order to conserve their role as carbon sinks.

Organic waste recycling application increases N availability and mitigates N2O emission without crop yield penalty in the North China Plain. Introduction: Agricultural organic waste recycling can supply nutrients for crop production and partially replace chemical nitrogen fertilizers, which is beneficial for waste management and environmental protection. Nevertheless, comprehensive evaluation of the effects of different organic materials applications on crop yield and the environment is limited. Methods: Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive investigation of the synergistic effects of straw, pig manure, and biogas residue recycling on the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) systems was carried out in the North China Plain. Field experiments were conducted from 2019 to 2021, comprising five treatments: straw (ST), pig manure (PM), and biogas residue (BR) partially replacing chemical nitrogen fertilizer, sole application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer (CF), and a control with no nitrogen application (WN). Results and discussion: The results showed that organic materials significantly increased soil total nitrogen (3.04%-9.10%) and N recovery efficiency (REN; 42.21%-44.99%), but pig manure was more beneficial in increasing crop yields (3.50%), especially wheat yields (8.72%), and REN was significantly higher than that of the other treatments. Organic materials performed differently in wheat and maize seasons, and wheat yield could be improved by organic materials return. Organic materials stimulated N2O emission in wheat season (4.28%-32.20%), while biogas residue inhibited the N2O emission in maize season (47.47%). The negative effect of straw and biogas residue on yield decreased with increasing years of return, and pig manure continued to contribute to yield. In conclusion, pig manure is the optimal alternative that can increase crop yield, soil N content, and REN without stimulating N2O emissions.

Response of soil N2O emission and nitrogen utilization to organic matter in the wheat and maize rotation system. The appropriate nitrogen (N) fertilizer regulator could increase N utilization of crops and reduce N losses in the North China Plain. We investigated the effects of reduced inorganic-N rate combined with an organic fertilizer on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in winter wheat and summer maize rotation system. Simultaneously studied the effect of different treatments on N use efficiency (NUE), N balance and net income. After reducing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the wheat-corn rotation system, the results showed that the cumulative emission of soil N2O from the RN40%+HOM [40% of RN (recommended inorganic-N rate) with homemade organic matter] treatment was 41.0% lower than that of the RN treatment. In addition, the N production efficiency, agronomic efficiency, and apparent utilization were significantly increased by 50.2%, 72.4% and 19.5% than RN, respectively. The use of RN40%+HOM resulted in 22.0 and 30.1% lower soil N residual and N losses as compared with RN. After adding organic substances, soil N2O cumulative emission of RN40%+HOM treatment decreased by 20.9% than that of the HAN (zinc and humic acid urea at the same inorganic-N rate of RN) treatment. The N production efficiency, N agronomic efficiency and NUE of RN40%+HOM treatment were 36.6%, 40.9% and 15.3% higher than HAN's. Moreover, soil residual and apparent loss N were 23.3% and 18.0% less than HAN's. The RN40%+HOM treatment appears to be the most effective as a fertilizer control method where it reduced N fertilizer input and its loss to the environment and provided the highest grain yield.

Gross Nitrogen Transformations and Related Nitrous Oxide Emissions in an Intensively Used Calcareous Soil. A better understanding of the internal N cycle in agriculturally used soils is crucial for developing sustainable and environmentally friendly N fertilizer management and to propose effective N2O mitigation strategies. The present laboratory study quantifies gross nitrogen transformations in an intensively used agricultural soil of the North China Plain (NCP). It also elucidates the role of nitrification and denitrification in the emissions of the greenhouse gas N2O. In the lab, soil samples adjusted to a water-filled pore space (WFPS) of 40 or 60% were spiked with (NH4NO3)-N-15, (NH4NO3)-N-15, or (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 and incubated at 20 degrees C for 10 d. One subset of the samples was amended with glucose. The size and N-15 enrichment of the mineral N pools and N2O fluxes were determined at intervals of 0 to 10 d. The studied calcareous soil showed a very rapid nitrification of the applied NH4+, which disappeared during the first 3 d. Glucose enhanced mineralization of native soil organic matter (SOM), stimulated dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and promoted the immobilization-remineralization cycle. Throughout the incubation, nitrification, and denitrification Occurred simultaneously. Nitrification was the dominant N2O-producing process and contributed 83.0 to 95.4% to the totally emitted N2O in the non-glucose soils. In contrast, the N2O emitted from (NO3-)-N-15 pool increased after adding glucose, indicating that denitrification was C-limited in the studied soil.

Effects of long-term amendment of organic manure and nitrogen fertilizer on nitrous oxide emission in a sandy loam soil. To understand the effects of long-term amendment of organic manure and N fertilizer on N2O emission in the North China Plain, a laboratory incubation at different temperatures and soil moistures were carried out using soils treated with organic manure (OM), half organic manure plus half fertilizer N (HOM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NP (NP), fertilizer NK (NK), fertilizer PK (NK) and control (CK) since 1989. Cumulative N2O emission in OM soil during the 17 d incubation period was slightly higher than in NPK soil under optimum nitrification conditions (25 degrees C and 60% water-filled pore space, WFPS), but more than twice under the optimum denitrification conditions (35 degrees C and 90% WFPS). N2O produced by denitrification was 2.1-2.3 times greater than that by nitrification in OM and HOM soils, but only 1.5 times greater in NPK and NP soils. These results implied that the long-term amendment of organic manure could significantly increase the N2O emission via denitrification in OM soil as compared to NPK soil. This is quite different from field measurement between OM soil and NPK soil. Substantial inhibition of the formation of anaerobic environment for denitrification in field might result in no marked difference in N2O emission between OM and NPK soils. This is due in part to more rapid oxygen diffusion in coarse textured soils than consumption by aerobic microbes until WFPS was 75% and to low easily decomposed organic C of organic manure. This finding suggested that addition of organic manure in the tested sandy loam might be a good management option since it seldom caused a burst of N2O emission but sequestered atmospheric C and maintained efficiently applied N in soil.

Nitrous oxide emissions from Chinese maize-wheat rotation systems: A 3-year field measurement. Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured over a 3-year period (2004-2007) in a long-term experimental field. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the interannual variation of N2O emissions from a maize-wheat rotation, under different fertilizer regimes and to determine the key controlling factors. The study involved four treatments: compost (OM), half compost N plus half inorganic fertilizer-N (HOM), inorganic fertilizer-N (NPK), and control (CK) where no N application. The mean annual N2O emission over a 3-year period was 030 +/- 0.11 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the CK treatment, but increased to 1.61 +/- 0.10 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the HOM treatment, 2.13 +/- 0.15 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the OM treatment, and 2.76 +/- 0.19 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the NPK treatment. Differences were significant among treatments. The N2O emission factors of the applied OM, NPK and HUM were 0.61 +/- 0.02, 0.82 +/- 0.10 and 0.44 +/- 0.04%, respectively, at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), indicating that the combined application of compost with inorganic fertilizer significantly reduced N2O emission. Over a maize-wheat rotation year, more than 65% of the annual N2O emission occurred during the maize growing season. There was a large interannual variation in N2O emission in all treatments, albeit not significant either during the maize growing season or at an inter-year scale. This interannual variation was mainly attributable to differences in soil moisture after basal fertilizer application, and irrigation and/or heavy rainfall events immediately following basal fertilization could induce more N2O production than pre-irrigation before plowing. The HOM treatment had higher N fertilizer use efficiency and lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions compared with the OM and NPK treatments. We therefore argue that the combined application of half compost N plus half fertilizer-N will mitigate N2O emissions from soils in the North China plain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects and mechanisms of deep straw incorporation and denitrifying bacterial agents on mitigating nitrate leaching and N2O emissions in four soil types in the North China Plain. The agricultural practice of straw incorporation is often employed to enhance soil fertility, improve soil properties and reduce nitrate leaching via deep burying. Nevertheless, the tradeoff between nitrate leaching and N2O emissions caused by deep straw incorporation in various soil types remains uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, a mesocosm column experiment was established to evaluate the impact of straw amendment (NS) and of straw plus application of denitrifying bacterial agents (NSS) at column depths of 20-60 cm on NO3--N leaching and N2O emission across four soil types (brown, cinnamon, fluvo-aquic and mortar black soil) in the North China plain. The results showed that the NS and NSS treatments significantly reduced NO3--N leaching by 47%-73% and 37%-81%, respectively, across four soil types, in comparison to the control without straw and bacterial agents (N), with the greatest reduction recorded in the mortar black soil (by 73% for NS and 81% for NSS). Meanwhile, the NS and NSS treatments resulted in a significant increase in cumulative N2O emissions (by 289% for NS and 598% for NSS) in the acidic brown soil with a soil pH ranging between 4.8 and 6.5, but showed no significant effect in the remaining three soil types in which soil pH is above 7.5. When compared to the NS treatment, NSS treatment reduced the cumulative N2O emissions in the fluvo-aquic soil by 42%. We further showed that soil type is the primary driver of bacterial community composition (R-2 = 62.3%; P < 0.001), followed by soil depth (R-2 = 5.2%; P < 0.001). The incorporation of straw and denitrifying bacterial agents induced significant change in the bacterial community in the middle depth layers, and increases in nosZ gene abundance and the relative abundance of inoculant-similar OTUs significantly by 0.5-37 folds and 2.8-6900 folds, respectively, in all soil types, suggesting the colonization of denitrifying bacterial agents. Our results further suggested that the Streptomycetales were the most important predictors for N2O emissions, and the relative abundance of Streptomycetales was highly positively correlated with N2O emissions across the four soil types. Overall, the study suggests that deep straw incorporation as soil amendment is effective in mitigating nitrate leaching in all four soil types, especially in the fluvo-aquic soil, due to its dual effects on controlling nitrate leaching and N2O emissions. However, it is not recommended for the acidic brown soils as it may cause increased N2O emissions.

Impact of biochar and deficit irrigation on greenhouse gas emissions reduction in maize-wheat rotation systems. Biochar application and irrigation management are widely regarded as effective strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural systems. However, the combined effects of these two approaches on greenhouse gas emissions remain insufficiently understood. This study investigated how different biochar application rates and irrigation strategies affect soil moisture and temperature, as well as the relationship between soil moisture, temperature, and greenhouse gas emissions. A two-year field experiment was conducted in the North China Plain to investigate the combined impact of deficit irrigation and biochar on greenhouse gas emissions in a summer maize-winter wheat rotation system. The experiment included three irrigation strategies (full irrigation (F: 70 %-80 % field capacity (theta(fc))), deficit irrigation (D: 50 %-60 % theta(fc)) during the jointing stage of maize and wheat (DJ), and deficit irrigation during the jointing stage and filling stage of maize and wheat (D-J+F)) and 3 biochar application rates (T: 0 t ha(-1) biochar, M: 15 t ha(-1) biochar, and H: 30 t ha(-1) biochar). The results showed that water-filled pore space (WFPS) and soil temperature were positively correlated with CO2 and N2O emission fluxes but had no significant relationship with CH4 emission flux. Decreasing irrigation and increasing biochar application led to a reduction in cumulative soil CO2 and N2O emissions, alongside an increase in CH4 absorption. The interaction between deficit irrigation and biochar application effectively reduced overall soil greenhouse gas emissions. Under high biochar application (H), deficit irrigation during the jointing stage of maize and wheat decreased the global warming potential by 15.9 %, with a minimal yield loss of only 4.86 %. These findings suggest that targeted deficit irrigation, combined with biochar application, is a promising strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while minimizing crop yield losses.

N2O emissions from soils under short-term straw return in a wheat-corn rotation system are associated with changes in the abundance of functional microbes. Straw return is an effective conservation tillage measure that improves soil properties, increases crop yields, and is an efficient means of reusing agrobioenergy by-products. Straw return has been shown to affect nitrogen (N) cycling and related functional microbes in agricultural soils. However, the relationship between nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and N-related functional genes under different straw return strategies in wheat-corn double cropping systems remains elusive. Here, we conducted a short-term field study to investigate the response of N2O emissions driven by N cycling functional genes (bacterial and archaeal amoA genes and nirS, nirK, and nosZ genes) to different straw return patterns in a wheat-corn double cropping system in the North China Plain. Three treatments were established, namely, both wheat and corn straw return (CWSR), only wheat straw mulch return (WSR), and no straw return (NSR). Over the wheat-corn season, the total N2O emissions significantly increased by 31.74% and 12.37% in CWSR and WSR-treated soils, respectively. Straw return increased nitrifying and denitrifying functional gene abundances, thus stimulating N2O emissions. Correlation analysis showed that AOA (r = 0.262, p < 0.05) and AOB (r = 0.703, p < 0.01) were strongly and positively correlated with NO3--N concentrations, indicating that AOA and AOB were involved in nitrification under straw return. Both nirS (r = 0.287, p < 0.05) and nirK genes (r = 0.252, p < 0.05) were positively correlated with N2O emissions, while nosZ genes (r =-0.266, p < 0.05) were negatively correlated with N2O emissions. Structural equation model (SEM) analysis further revealed that straw return indirectly affected N2O emissions by influencing the abundances of AOB-amoA (r = 0.324, p < 0.05), nirK (r = 0.417, p < 0.05), and nosZ (r =-0.388, p < 0.001) genes. Overall, short-term straw return increased N2O production in a wheat-corn double cropping system, mainly through increased AOB-amoA and nirK gene abundance, which stimulated N2O production, and reduced nosZ gene abundance, which inhibited N2O reduction.

Measurement report: Exchange fluxes of HONO over agricultural fields in the North China Plain. Nitrous acid (HONO) is a crucial precursor of tropospheric hydroxyl radicals, but its sources are not fully understood. Soil is recognized as an important HONO source, but the lack of measurements of soil-atmosphere HONO exchange flux ( F HONO ) has led to uncertainties in modeling its atmospheric impacts and understanding the reactive nitrogen budget. Herein, we conduct F HONO measurements over agricultural fields under fertilized ( F HONO - NP , normal fertilization and irrigation) and non-fertilized ( F HONO - CK , normal irrigation but no fertilization) treatments. Our results show that nitrogen fertilizer use causes a remarkable increase in F HONO - NP . F HONO - NP exhibits distinct diurnal variations, with an average noontime peak of 152 ng N m - 2 s - 1 . The average F HONO - NP within 3 weeks after fertilization is 97.7 +/- 8.6 ng N m - 2 s - 1 , around 2 orders of magnitude higher than before fertilization, revealing the remarkable promotion effect of nitrogen fertilizer on HONO emissions.We also discuss other factors influencing soil HONO emissions, such as meteorological parameters and soil properties/nutrients. Additionally, we estimate the HONO emission factor of 0.68 +/- 0.07 % relative to the applied nitrogen during the whole growing season of summer maize. Accordingly, the fertilizer-induced soil HONO emission is estimated to be 22.3 and 60.8 Gg N yr - 1 in the North China Plain (NCP) and mainland China, respectively, representing a significant reactive nitrogen source. Furthermore, our observations reveal that soil emissions sustain a high level of daytime HONO, enhancing the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and aggravating O 3 pollution in the NCP. Our results indicate that to mitigate regional air pollution effectively, future policies should consider reactive nitrogen emissions from agricultural soils.

Modelling water dynamics with DNDC and DAISY in a soil of the North China Plain: A comparative study. The performance of the DNDC and Daisy model to simulate the water dynamics in a floodplain soil of the North China Plain was tested and compared. While the DNDC model uses a simple cascade approach, the Daisy model applies the physically based Richard's equation for simulating water movement in soil. For model testing a three years record of the soil water content from the Dong Bei Wang experimental station near Beijing was used. There, the effect of nitrogen fertilization, irrigation and straw removal on soil water and nitrogen dynamics was investigated in a three factorial field experiment applying a split-split-plot design with 4 replications. The dataset of one treatment was used for model testing and calibration. Two other independent datasets from further treatments were employed for validating the models. For both models, the simulation results were not satisfying using default parameters. After parameter optimisation and the use of site-specific van Genuchten parameters, however, the Daisy model performed well. But, for the DNDC model, parameter optimisation failed to improve the simulation result. Owing to the fact that many biological processes such as plant growth, nitrification or denitrification depend strongly on the soil water content, our findings bring us to the conclusion that the site-specific suitability of the DNDC model for simulating the soil water dynamics should be tested before further simulation of other processes.

Conservation farming practices in winter wheat-summer maize cropping reduce GHG emissions and maintain high yields. No-till (NT), straw incorporation (SI) and optimized N fertilization are important mitigation options for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agroecosystems. These measures may also help to maintain high crop production and are frequently recommended for use in northern China. Few studies, however, have addressed the interactive effects of these conservation and fertilization practices with respect to GHG emissions and crop yields. We report on a field experiment conducted in two consecutive dry years (2013-2015) when precipitation was much lower than the long-term average. We examined the effects of three different N fertilizer application rates, tillage practice and straw management on crop yields, GHG, area-scaled GHG (in global warming potential) and net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) of a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in northern China. Results showed that reducing N fertilizer significantly decreased soil N2O emissions without affecting annual crop yields. Compared with the average of all other fertilization treatments, the no-till x straw incorporation (NT x SI) practice increased both wheat and maize yields. However, in the maize season, NT also increased cumulative N2O emissions compared with conventional tillage (CT). The practices of combining N fertilization with straw management conferred an additional effect on 1920 emissions when compared with single practices (i.e, fertilization or straw management). Compared with straw removal (SR) treatments, SI increased annual cumulative N2O emissions by 37% for the conventional N fertilization, but decreased them by 13% at the optimized N fertilization. Neither single practice nor integrated practices had a significant effect on cumulative CH4 uptake. The highest NEEB values were obtained in NT x SI x optimal N fertilization (OPT) and NT x SR x OPT in the 1st and 2nd cropping years, respectively. We conclude that, when considering the additional benefits of SI for improving soil fertility and C sequestration, the NT x SI x OPT practice would be a viable strategy to achieve high crop yields, while simultaneously reducing GHG emissions.

Irrigation of DOC-rich liquid promotes potential denitrification rate and decreases N2O/(N2O+N2) product ratio in a 0-2 m soil profile. Lack of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is generally one of the key factors limiting denitrification in subsoil beneath the root zone. Despite a number of laboratory DOC amendment studies, the effects of in situ DOC infiltration on subsoil denitrification, and on subsequent end product composition, are less understood. Here, we report on the effects of in situ infiltration of a DOC-rich liquid, derived from decomposing straw, on potential denitrification rate (PDR), N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio, and nitrate stock in a 0-2 m soil profile. The results showed that in situ infiltration with a DOC-rich liquid (100 mm, 2 ton DOC ha(-1)) significantly increased the DOC concentration and PDR, and significantly decreased the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio in the soil profile. Up to 70% of the nitrate accumulated in the 0-2 m soil profile disappeared within three weeks following the infiltration of the DOC-rich liquid. The majority of the nitrate removed could be accounted for by denitrification. The predominant end product of denitrification was N-2. The mass ratio between the consumed DOC and nitrate-N was about 5. Our results demonstrate the significant potential for removing subsoil nitrate by in situ introduction of DOC generated from the above-ground crop biomass. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cereal-Legume Mixed Residue Addition Increases Yield and Reduces Soil Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fertilized Winter Wheat in the North China Plain. Incorporating crop residues into the soil is an effective method for improving soil carbon sequestration, fertility, and crop productivity. Such potential benefits, however, may be offset if residue addition leads to a substantial increase in soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study aimed to quantify the effect of different crop residues with varying C/N ratios and different nitrogen (N) fertilizers on GHG emissions, yield, and yield-scaled emissions (GHGI) in winter wheat. The field experiment was conducted during the 2018-2019 winter wheat season, comprising of four residue treatments (no residue, maize residue, soybean residue, and maize-soybean mixed residue) and four fertilizer treatments (control, urea, manure, and manure + urea). The experiment followed a randomized split-plot design, with N treatments as the main plot factor and crop residue treatments as the sub-plot factor. Except for the control, all N treatments received 150 kg N ha(-1) season(-1). The results showed that soils from all treatments acted as a net source of N2O and CO2 fluxes but as a net sink of CH4 fluxes. Soybean residue significantly increased soil N2O emissions, while mixed residue had the lowest N2O emissions among the three residues. However, all residue amendments significantly increased soil CO2 emissions. Furthermore, soybean and mixed residues significantly increased grain yield by 24% and 21%, respectively, compared to no residue amendment. Both soybean and mixed residues reduced GHGI by 25% compared to maize residue. Additionally, the urea and manure + urea treatments exhibited higher N2O emissions among the N treatments, but they contributed to significantly higher grain yields and resulted in lower GHGI. Moreover, crop residue incorporation significantly altered soil N dynamics. In soybean residue-amended soil, both NH4+ and NO3- concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.05). Conversely, soil NO3- content was notably lower in the maize-soybean mixed residue amendment. Overall, our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how different residue additions from different cropping systems influence soil N dynamics and GHG emissions, offering valuable insights into effective agroecosystems management for long-term food security and soil sustainability while mitigating GHG emissions.

Effects of different agricultural organic wastes on soil GHG emissions: During a 4-year field measurement in the North China Plain. Large quantities and many varieties of agricultural organic wastes are produced in China annually. Applying agricultural organic wastes to soil plays an essential role in coping with the environmental pollution from agricultural wastes, solving the energy crisis and responding global climate change. But there is little information available on the effects of different agricultural organic wastes on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The objectives of this study were to investigate and compare the impacts of different organic wastes on soil GHG emissions during a 4-year field experiments in the North China Plain, as well as analyze the influential factors that may be related to GHG emissions. The treatments were: crop straw (CS), biogas residue (BR), mushroom residue (MR), wine residue (WR) and pig manure (PM) returning to soil, as well as a control with no organic waste applied to soil but chemical fertilizer addition only (CF). The results showed that compared with CF treatment, organic material applied to soil significantly increased GHG emissions and emissions followed the order of WR(27,961.51 kg CO2-eq/ha/yr) > PM (26,376.50 kg CO2-eq/haiyr) > MR(23,366.60 kg CO2-eq/ha/yr) > CS(22,434.44 kg CO2-eq/ha/yr) > BR (22,029.04 kg CO2-eq/haiyr) > CF(17,402.77 kg CO2-eq/haiyr), averagely. And considering the affecting factors, GHG emissions were significantly related to soil temperature and soil water content. Different organic wastes also affected soil total organic carbon (TOC), microbial carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents, which related to GHG emissions. Further analysis showed that characteristics of organic wastes affected GHG emissions, which included C-N ratio, lignin, polyphenol, cellulose and hemicellulose. Our study demonstrates that biogas residue returning to soil emitted minimum GHG emissions among these different types of organic wastes, which provided a better solution for applying organic wastes to mitigate soil GHG emissions.

Effects of soil warming and straw return on soil organic matter and greenhouse gas fluxes in winter wheat seasons in the North China Plain. As one of the greatest political and scientific issues, global warming is affecting the terrestrial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles and subsequently greenhouse gases (GHGs) fluxes. Straw return is considered as an environmentally friendly management to increase soil health and agricultural productivity. However, little is known about their interactive effects on soil organic matter (SOM) and GHGs emissions. Therefore, we collected two-year data from a field experiment in the North China Plain (NCP) to elucidate the effects of soil warming (ambient temperature vs. warming +3.8 degrees C) and straw management (straw removal vs. straw return) on soil properties, nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes during winter wheat seasons. Soil warming stimulated the available nutrients (NH4+, NO3-, and dissolved organic C), and thereby increased cumulative CO2 emission by 17.5-25.0% compared with ambient temperature, while had no effect on N2O fluxes. Straw return enhanced soil CO2 and N2O emissions by 11.5-28.3% and 37.1-48.4% compared with straw removal, respectively. This was mainly due to increased organic matter input stimulating microbial activity, thereby accelerating soil C and N cycling. The NCP was found to be a CH4 sink, and soil warming and straw return increased the CH 4 uptake. Finally, soil warming combined straw return resulted in the highest GHGs budget, and we estimated that almost 7.1 t CO2-eq ha(-1) per wheat season would be lost in response to soil warming and straw return in the NCP. In the second growing season, soil organic C (SOC) and total N (TN) were reduced under warming by 6.1% and 4.9% due to the stimulated decomposition and mineralization, respectively. However, the decreases considerably counteracted by straw return, which enhanced the SOC and TN by 5.8% and 9.4%, respectively. Our study suggested that soil warming and straw return will lead to stimulated GHGs emissions in wheat seasons in the NCP, while straw return may contribute to the mitigation of global warming through increasing SOM accumulation.

Spatial patterns and driving factor analysis of recommended nitrogen application rate for the trade-off between economy and environment for maize in China. Appropriate nitrogen (N) application increases crop yield, while its unreasonable application results in environmental problem. Determining the appropriate N application rate is the key to sustainable development. Here, the denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model was used to analyze the effects of N fertilizer on maize yields, economic benefits, nitrate leaching, and nitrous oxide emissions in China. The N application rate for the trade-off between economy and environment at the county scale was further determined. The geodetector model was used to identify the main driving factors and their interactions of the recommended N rate in each agricultural zone. The results showed that the recommended N rate was generally high in the northwest but low in the south, consistent with the spatial patterns of yield potential. However, clay soils with clay ratios greater than 34% in southern China and sandy soils with bulk densities greater than 1.5 g cm(-3) on the Huanghuaihai Plain experienced high N levels and low yields, and thus soils need to be improved. Potential grain yield was the main driving factor in most zones, yet its effects gradually weakened from north to south. The influence of soil characteristics increased from north to south. It was found that the current average N application rate of farmers in China was 249 kg N/ha, and 86.55% of counties had excessive N applications. Compared to the regional optimal N rate at a regional scale, a differentiated N application strategy at the county scale determined in this study increased maize yield and economic benefit by 10.51% and 10.85%, respectively, and reduced N2O emissions and NO3- leaching by 28.72% and 33.60%, respectively. The current research provides a scientific basis for China to formulate a win-win N management strategy for economy and environment and provides a method reference for other countries.

Deficit irrigation combined with reduced N-fertilizer rate can mitigate the high nitrous oxide emissions from Chinese drip-fertigated maize field. Agricultural soils are major sources of the greenhouse gas N2O, particularly under maize with high nitrogen (N) inputs and excessive irrigation. To determine how N and water management can mitigate N2O emissions from drip-irrigated maize fields, a field study was carried out in the North China Plain during the maize growing season. The objective of the study was to investigate the individual and combined effects of irrigation level and N input on N2O emissions and grain yields, as well as N and water use efficiency (WUE), under drip-fertigation management. The main treatments were two irrigation levels: 50 mm/event (sufficient irrigation, W-H) and 25 mm/event (limited irrigation, W-L), with four N application rates: 0 (N-0), 90 (N-1), 180 (N-2), and 270 (N-3) kg N ha(-1). Pulses of N2O emissions were recorded every 2-3 d following each irrigation or fertigation (irrigation + fertilization) event. N input, irrigation, and their interactions all significantly influenced N2O emissions. A significant exponential relationship (P < 0.05) was observed between N application rate and cumulative and yield-scaled N2O emissions in both irrigation treatments. The cumulative N2O emission fluxes from the N-0, N-1, N-2, and N-3 levels of fertilizer with W-L were 11.4, 13.8, 27.2, and 58.8% lower, respectively, than those from the same N levels with W-H; this occurred because high pulses of N2O were avoided during low irrigation conditions. Under W-H, denitrification was the likely source of the high amounts of N2O, whereas nitrification was likely the main source of N2O emissions under W-L. The variations in the water-filled pore space (WFPS) between the two irrigation treatments may explain these results. The effect of N fertilizer on grain yield and WUE depended on the availability of soil water. Based on the available soil water content, the regulation of N fertilizer application can increase yield and also reduce cumulative and yield-scaled N2O emissions. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Evaluating Gas Emissions from Different Feed Cropping Systems in the North China Plain: A Two-Year Field Measurement. The cultivation of silage crops is encouraged to enhance the connection between crop and livestock production in the North China Plain (NCP). A field experiment was designed to evaluate the ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) emissions of five silage cropping systems, including triticale-summer maize (Tr-SuM), triticale-spring maize (Tr-SpM), triticale-double forage maize (Tr-DFM), double forage maize (DFM), and winter wheat-summer maize (WW-SuM), as well as their biomass- and crude protein-scaled emission intensities, with respect to NH3 and greenhouse gas (GHG). The annual nitrogen (N) emissions through NH3, N2O, and CH4 emissions of these systems were 13.43-23.77 kg ha(-1) (4.2-5.6% of N fertilizer input), 3.43-4.56 kg ha(-1) (0.75-1.08% of N fertilizer input) and 2.10-2.85 kg ha(-1), respectively. The total GHG emissions of these systems was dominated by the contributions of N2O. Ranking these systems according to their biomass and crude protein production gave Tr-DFM > DFM > WW-SuM > Tr-SuM and Tr-SpM, their partial factor productivity was in the order of Tr-DFM > WW-SuM > Tr-SuM and Tr-SpM > DFM, and the order of their emission intensity was DFM > Tr-SuM > Tr-DFM > WW-SuM > Tr-SpM. In conclusion, the Tr-DFM needs to be further investigated for its suitability in the NCP, owing to its superior productivity and moderate emission intensities.

New estimates of direct N2O emissions from Chinese croplands from 1980 to 2007 using localized emission factors. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a long-lived greenhouse gas with a large radiation intensity and it is emitted mainly from agricultural land. Accurate estimates of total direct N2O emissions from croplands on a country scale are important for global budgets of anthropogenic sources of N2O emissions and for the development of effective mitigation strategies. The objectives of this study were to re-estimate direct N2O emissions using localized emission factors and a database of measurements from Chinese croplands. We obtained N2O emission factors for paddy fields (0.41 +/- 0.04 %) and uplands (1.05 +/- 0.02 %) from a normalization process through cube root transformation of the original data. After comparing the results of normalization from the original values, Logarithmic and cube root transformations were used because the frequency of the original data was not normally distributed. Direct N2O emissions from Chinese croplands from 1980 to 2007 were estimated using IPCC (2006) guidelines combined with separate localized emission factors for paddy fields and upland areas. Direct N2O emissions from paddy fields showed little change, increasing by 10.5% with an annual rate of increase of 0.4% from 32.3 Gg N2O-N in 1980 to 35.7 Gg N2O-N in 2007. In contrast, emissions from uplands changed dramatically, increasing by 308% with an annual rate of 11% from 68.0 Gg N2O-N in 1980 to 278 Gg N2O-N in 2007. Total direct N2O emissions from Chinese croplands increased by 213% with an annual rate of 7.6% from 100 Gg N2O-N in 1980 to 313 Gg N2O-N in 2007, and were determined mainly by upland emissions (accounting for 67.8-88.6% of total emissions from 1980 to 2007). Synthetic N fertilizers played a major role in N2O emissions from agricultural land, and the magnitude of the contributions to total direct N2O emissions made by different amendments was synthetic N fertilizer > manure > straw, representing about 78, 15, and 6% of total direct N2O emissions, respectively, between 2000 and 2007. The spatial pattern of total N2O emissions in 2007 in China shows that high direct N2O emissions occurred mainly in the north and in the Sichuan Basin in the southwest. The provinces with the highest emissions were Henan (35.4 Gg) and Shandong (31.6 Gg) and Tibet had the lowest (0.65 Gg). High direct N2O emissions per unit of arable land occurred mainly on the North China Plain and the southeast coast. The mean value nationally was 2.52 kg N ha(-1), with 18 provinces above this value and with emissions of >4.0 kg N ha(-1) in Beijing, Tianjin and in Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian and Henan provinces.

Manipulation of nitrogen leaching from tea field soil using a Trichoderma viride biofertilizer. With the increasing use of chemical fertilizers, negative environmental impacts have greatly increased as a result from agricultural fields. The fungus Trichoderma viride used as a biofertilizer can efficiently reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from subtropical tea fields in southern China. In this paper, it was further found that T. viride biofertilizer could alleviate nitrogen (N) leaching in tea fields. Gross N leaching was 1.51 kg ha(-1) year(-1) with no external fertilizer input, but when 225 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)was applied, it increased to 12.38 kg ha(-1) year(-1) using T. viride biofertilizer but 53.46 kg ha(-1) year(-1) using urea. Stepwise linear regression analysis identified the factors responsible for N leaching to be soil nitrate concentration and soil interflow, simulated here using the water balance simulation model (WaSiM-ETH). Finally, mass-scale production of T. viride biofertilizer from waste reutilization using sweet potato starch wastewater and rice straw was found to be cost-effective and feasible. These procedures could be considered a best management practice to reduce N leaching from tea fields in subtropical areas of central China and to reduce pollution from other agricultural waste products.

Reducing N2O emissions while maintaining yield in a wheat-maize rotation system modelled by APSIM. CONTEXT: Modelling approaches have already been used to quantitatively assess the trade-offs between crop yield and N2O emissions as impacted by management practices. However, the model's performance in terms of predicting N2O emissions was mainly assessed against total emissions per growing season or year, which may reduce accuracy in modelling due to the uncertainties in total emissions estimated using the manual (static) chamber method. OBJECTIVE: Here, a comparison between optimizations for Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) with total N2O emissions and daily N2O emissions was conducted. We further used the validated model to develop simple surrogate models for estimating total N2O emissions in different years and target potential opportunities to reduce N2O emissions while still maintaining the grain yield under long-term climatic conditions. METHODS: Five parameters relating to denitrification and nitrification were optimized using differential evolution algorithm for global optimization based on two-year field experimental data at Huantai site in North China Plain, and comprehensive simulation experiments were further conducted under long-term climate variability in an irrigated wheat-maize rotation system. The method of Levenberg-Marquardt was implemented to fit simple surrogate models for estimating total N2O emissions in different years, and Analysis of Variance was used for model comparison. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: APSIM model optimized with daily N2O emissions could better simulate soil N2O and nitrate dynamics than that optimized with total N2O emissions. We obtained the posterior distributions of five key parameters to which N2O emissions are sensitive, and demonstrated that original model using default parameters could underestimate the rate of nitrification and denitrification and the subsequent N2O emissions. Total N2O emissions increased exponentially with nitrogen application rate and mean temperature, and IPCC (1% emission factor) could underestimate whole-year N2O emissions when N rate was higher than the optimized nitrogen rate for crop production. We also found that there was potential to optimize nitrogen fertiliser rate to reduce N2O emissions while still maintaining crop yield in the irrigated wheat-maize rotation system. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated the necessity of optimization with daily N2O emissions in improving model accuracy, and the posterior distributions of five parameters relating to N2O emissions offered reference range for future model improvement and applications.

Responses of greenhouse gas fluxes to experimental warming in wheat season under conventional tillage and no-tillage fields. Understanding the effects of warming on greenhouse gas (GHG, such as N2O, CH4 and CO2) feedbacks to climate change represents the major environmental issue. However, little information is available on how warming effects on CHG fluxes in farmland of North China Plain (NCP). An infrared warming simulation experiment was used to assess the responses of N2O, CI-I-4 and CO2 to warming in wheat season of 2012-2014 from conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems. The results showed that warming increased cumulative N2O emission by 7.7% in CT but decreased it by 9.7% in NT fields (p < 0.05). Cumulative CH4 uptake and CO2 emission were increased by 28.7%-51.7% and 6.3%-15.9% in both two tillage systems, respectively (p < 0.05). The stepwise regressions relationship between GHG fluxes and soil temperature and soil moisture indicated that the supply soil moisture due to irrigation and precipitation would enhance the positive warming effects on CHG fluxes in two wheat seasons. However, in 2013, the long-term drought stress due to infrared wanning and less precipitation decreased N2O and CO2 emission in warmed treatments. In contrast, warming during this time increased CH4 emission from deep soil depth. Across two years wheat seasons, warnaing significantly decreased by 30.3% and 63.9% sustained-flux global warming potential (SGWP) of N20 and CH4 expressed as CO2 equivalent in CT and NT fields, respectively. However, increase in soil CO2 emission indicated that future wan-ning projection might provide positive feedback between soil C release and global warming in NCP.

Reducing N2O emissions with enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs) in a high-yielding spring maize system. Enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs), including nitrification inhibitors (NIs) and slow-release fertilizer (SRF), are considered promising approaches for mitigating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions while improving crop yield. This study investigated the combined application of EENFs with improved water and fertilizer management in an intensively irrigated spring maize rotation over five years in North-western China. High-frequency measurements of N2O fluxes were made throughout each year (both during crop growth and the fallow season) in five treatments: no N fertilizer as a control (CK), conventional N fertilization and irrigation (Con), optimum N fertilization and irrigation (Opt, 33% reduction in N fertilizer and 25% reduction of irrigation water), optimum N fertilization and irrigation with nitrification inhibitor (Opt + NI), and optimum N fertilization and irrigation with slow-release fertilizer (Opt-SRF). Annual mean cumulative N2O emissions reached 0.31 +/- 0.07, 3.66 +/- 0.19, 1.87 +/- 0.16, 1.23 +/- 0.13, and 1.61 +/- 0.16 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for CK, Con, Opt, Opt thorn NI, and Opt-SRF, respectively, with annual mean nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of 36, 54, 61 and 59% for Con, Opt, Opt thorn NI, and Opt-SRF, respectively. The Opt, Opt thorn NI and Opt-SRF treatments significantly reduced cumulative N2O emissions by 49%, 66%, and 56% (P < 0.05), respectively, and increased NUE by 51%, 70%, and 66% (P < 0.05), respectively, relative to Con. However, mean above-ground N uptake (288-309 kg N ha(-1)) and mean grain yields (12.7-12.8 Mg ha(-1)) did not differ significantly between the Con, Opt, Opt thorn NI, and Opt-SRF treatments during the five-year study. High N2O emissions mainly occurred within a few days of fertilization with irrigation, which could have been produced by microbially-mediated nitrifier or nitrifier denitrification processes. The fallow seasons had significantly lower cumulative N2O emissions, which were mainly attributed to the low temperature, low N inputs of crop residues, and low soil moisture conditions. Our study clearly indicated that the combined application of EENFs with optimum N fertilization and irrigation management can reduce environmental impacts while maintaining high crop yields in dryland regions such as Northwest China.

Effect of mulching and biochar addition on the distribution and emission characteristics of N2O from furrow-ridge tillage soils. Mulching and biochar are increasingly used individually in agriculture, but little is known about their combined effects on N2O distribution and dispersion in ridge and furrow profiles. We conducted a 2-year field experiment in northern China to determine soil N2O concentrations using the in situ gas well technique and calculate N2O fluxes from ridge and furrow profiles by the concentration gradient method. The results showed that mulch and biochar increased soil temperature and moisture and altered the mineral nitrogen status, leading to a decrease in the relative abundance of nitrification genes in the furrow area and an increase in the relative abundance of denitrification genes, with denitrification remaining as the main source of N2O production. N2O concentrations in the soil profile increased significantly after fertiliser application, and N2O concentrations in the ridge area of the mulch treatment were much higher than those in the furrow area, where vertical and horizontal diffusion occurred. Biochar addition was effective in reducing N2O concentrations but had no effect on the N2O distribution and diffusion pattern. Soil temperature and moisture, but not soil mineral nitrogen, explained the variation in soil N2O fluxes during the non-fertiliser application period. Compared to furrow-ridge planting (RF), furrow-ridge mulch planting (RFFM), furrow-ridge planting with biochar (RBRF) and furrow-ridge mulch planting with biochar (RFRB) resulted in 9.2%, 11.8% and 20.8% increases in yield per unit area and 1.9%, 26.3% and 27.4% decreases in N2O fluxes per unit of yield, respectively. The interaction between mulching and biochar significantly affected the N2O fluxes per unit of yield. Biochar costs aside, RFRB is very promising for increasing alfalfa yields and reducing N2O fluxes per unit of yield.

Oxygen-depletion by rapid ammonia oxidation regulates kinetics of N2O, NO and N2 production in an ammonium fertilised agricultural soil. Oxygen (O-2) is a key factor driving the expression of N-cycle-related functional genes and regulating nitrogenous gas production in the soil. However, how and to what extent the associated gene transcription and corresponding gas kinetics interact with the transition of soil O-2 status caused by N fertilisation, remains poorly understood. In this context, we conducted a robotized incubation experiment using a He/O-2 atmosphere with different amounts of ammonium-based fertiliser (0 (control), 60 (AS(60)) and 200 mg N kg(-1) (NH4)(2)SO4 (AS(200))) applied to an agricultural soil with a strong nitrification potential under three different initial O-2 levels (oxic 21%, sub-oxic 3%, and anoxic 0%) over 14 days. Through repeated measurements of N2O, NO, and N-2 concentrations and kinetics of mineral N following the decline of O-2 concentrations, we found that higher ammonium addition (200 vs. 60 mg N kg(-1)) caused faster O-2 consumption in the headspace and induced up to 238 times higher net accumulation of N2O under initially oxic headspace condition. We speculate that this was due to: 1) the rapid transition of O-2 status from oxic to anoxic due to vigorous ammonia oxidation; and 2) the increased N2O/(N2O + NO + N-2) ratio of denitrification with higher N addition. The amoA and nosZ gene transcript numbers changed significantly in response to ammonium addition and decreasing O-2 concentration, whereas high-throughput sequencing revealed a significant structural alteration of the soil microbiota along with the transition of O-2 status. Our results highlight that the vigorousness of oxygen depletion in the soil matrix driven by rapid ammonia oxidation is the proximal factor that regulates gas kinetics in high nitrification-potential soil when O-2 diffusion is limited. This implies that practices which reduce hotspots of ammonia oxidation have the potential to mitigate N2O emissions from nitrifier denitrification and denitrification in agricultural soil.

Net global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity in a double-cropping cereal rotation as affected by nitrogen and straw management. The effects of nitrogen and straw management on global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in a winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping system on the North China Plain were investigated. We measured nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and studied net GWP (NGWP) and GHGI by calculating the net exchange of CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) from greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural inputs and management practices, as well as changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), based on a long-term field experiment established in 2006. The field experiment includes six treatments with three fertilizer N levels (zero N (control), optimum and conventional N) and straw removal (i.e. N-0 N-opt and N-con) or return (i.e. SN0, SNopt and SNcon). Optimum N management (N-opt, SNopt) saved roughly half of the fertilizer N compared to conventional agricultural practice (N-con, SNcon), with no significant effect on grain yields. Annual mean N2O emissions reached 3.90 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in N-con and SNcon, and N2O emissions were reduced by 46.9% by optimizing N management of N-opt and SNopt. Straw return increased annual mean N2O emissions by 27.9 %. Annual SOC sequestration was 0.40-1.44Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in plots with N application and/or straw return. Compared to the conventional N treatments the optimum N treatments reduced NGWP by 51 %, comprising 25% from decreasing N2O emissions and 75% from reducing N fertilizer application rates. Straw return treatments reduced NGWP by 30% compared to no straw return because the GWP from increments of SOC offset the GWP from higher emissions of N2O, N fertilizer and fuel after straw return. The GHGI trends from the different nitrogen and straw management practices were similar to the NGWP. In conclusion, optimum N and straw return significantly reduced NGWP and GHGI and concomitantly achieved relatively high grain yields in this important winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping system.

Impacts of slurry application methods and inhibitors on gaseous emissions and N2O pathways in meadow-cinnamon soil. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of mitigation practices (slurry application methods and inhibitors applications) on gas emissions and identify the soil N2O production pathways in cattle slurry applied soil using isotopocule mapping approach. First, we compared the NH3 and N2O emissions of cattle slurry applied soil in a summer maize field experiment in north China plain (NCP) with four treatments: control (CK, no fertilization), slurry application using surface (SA-S), slurry application using band application (BA-S), and chemical fertilizer application using band application (BA-C). Then, an incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the mitigation effect of nitrification inhibitors (dicyandiamide, DCD) and denitrification inhibitors (procyanidins, PC) and their combination (DCD + PC) on gaseous N emissions with slurry applied using incorporation (IA) or surface application (SA) methods. The results showed that the total gaseous N emissions (N2O-N and NH3-N) in field were in the order of SA-S (1534 mg m(-2)) > BA-S (338 mg m(-2)) > BA-C (128 mg m(-2)) > CK (55 mg m(-2)), and the dominant N loss contributor varied from NH3 in SA-S (similar to 89%) to N2O in BA-S (similar to 94%) and BA-C (similar to 88%). Moreover, the isotopocule mapping approach indicated that emitted N2O of the slurry applied soil in field appeared to have lower rN(2)O values and led to more N2O + N-2 emissions at the initial fertilization period. The incubation experiment indicated that the N2O emissions of slurry-applied soil were significantly reduced by DCD (similar to 45%) and DCD + PC (similar to 67%) application in comparison with CK (p < 0.05), and the stronger contributions of bacterial denitrification/nitrifier denitrification to N2O production were revealed by the lower delta N-15(SP) in N2O using the isotopocule mapping approach. In conclusion, in NCP the gaseous losses of the slurry applied field can be largely reduced by using incorporation method, and greater reduction could be achieved given the simultaneous application of nitrification/denitrification inhibitors.

N2O and CO2 emissions, nitrogen use efficiency under biogas slurry irrigation: A field study of two consecutive wheat-maize rotation cycles in the North China Plain. Reuse of biogas slurry (BGS) could reduce fertilizer application rate because this material is an alternative source of nutrients and irrigation that could replace some of applied fertilizer. However, the environmental impacts of BGS irrigation, such as greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are poorly understood. We investigated the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of BGS irrigation by quantifying the nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions under different BGS irrigation rates in a two-year wheat-maize rotation field in the North China Plain. We found BGS irrigation did not change the patterns and fluxes of CO2 and N2O emission during the entire wheat-maize cropping cycle. In addition, there were no significant difference between BGS treatments (BSL, BSM, and BSH) and conventional fertilizer treatment (CF) in GWP. Further, no significant difference occurred in GHGI between BSM (33% BGS and 67% groundwater were mixed and irrigated during the wintering period and joining stage of wheat and after maize sowing, 315 kg.N.hm(-1)), BSH (50% BGS and 50% groundwater were mixed and irrigated during the wintering period and joining stage of wheat and after maize sowing, 477 kg.N.hm(-1)) and CF (conventional NPK fertilizer, 420 kg.N.ha(-1)), despite a higher value BSL (33% BGS and 67% groundwater were mixed and irrigated during the wintering period of wheat and after maize sowing, 210 kg.N.hm(-1)). The BSL and BSM treatments significantly increased the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) compared to the CF treatment (11.3% for BSL and 15.3% for BSM). Despite the lower NUE in the BSH treatment relative to CF, it was not statistically significant. Therefore, BGS reuse can increase NUE and does not cause environmental impacts. According to the results of GHGI and NUE, it can be concluded that BSM should be recommended as an improved recycling management practice for the wheat-maize rotation systems.

Impacts of Elevated Atmospheric CO2 and N Fertilization on N2O Emissions and Dynamics of Associated Soil Labile C Components and Mineral N in a Maize Field in the North China Plain. The elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO(2)) is expected to increase the labile C input to the soil, which may stimulate microbial activity and soil N2O emissions derived from nitrification and denitrification. However, few studies studied the effect of eCO(2) on N2O emissions from maize field under the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) conditions in the warm temperate zone. Here, we report a study conducted during the 12th summer maize season under long-term eCO(2), aiming to investigate the effect of eCO(2) on N2O emissions. Moreover, we tested zero and conventional N fertilization treatments, with maize being grown under either eCO(2) or ambient CO2 (aCO(2)). We hypothesized that N2O emissions would be increased under eCO(2) due to changes in soil labile C and mineral N derived from C-deposition, and that the increase would be larger when eCO(2) was combined with conventional N fertilization. We also measured the activities of some soil extracellular enzymes, which could reflect soil C status. The results showed that, under eCO(2), seasonal N2O and CO2 emissions increased by 12.4-15.6% (p < 0.1) and 13.8-18.5% (p < 0.05), respectively. N fertilization significantly increased the seasonal emissions of N2O and CO2 by 33.1-36.9% and 17.1-21.8%, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of eCO(2) and N fertilization increased the intensity of soil N2O and CO2 emissions. The marginal significant increase in N2O emissions under eCO(2) was mostly due to the lower soil water regime after fertilization in the study year. Dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC) concentration showed a significant increase at most major stages, particularly at the tasseling stage during the summer maize growth period under eCO(2). In contrast, soil mineral N showed a significant decrease under eCO(2) particularly in the rhizospheric soils. The activities of C-related soil extracellular enzymes were significantly higher under eCO(2), particularly at the tasseling stage, which coincided with concurrent increased DOC and MBC under eCO(2). We conclude that eCO(2) increases N2O emissions, and causes a higher increase when combined with N fertilization, but the increase extent of N2O emissions was influenced by environmental factors, especially by soil water, to a great extent. We highlighted the urgent need to monitor long-term N2O emissions and N2O production pathways in various hydrothermal regimes under eCO(2).

Sustainable water and nitrogen optimization to adapt to different temperature variations and rainfall patterns for a trade-off between winter wheat yield and N2O emissions br. Optimizing irrigation and nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications is essential to ensure crop yields and lower environmental risks under climate change. The DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was employed to investigate the impacts of irrigation regime (RF, rainfed; MI, minimum irrigation; CI, critical irrigation; FI, full irrigation) and N fertilizer rate(N60, N90, N120, N150, N180, N210, N240, N270, and N300 kg ha-1) on yield and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from winter wheat growing season under different temperature rise levels (+0, +0.5, +1.0, +1.5, and +2.0 degrees C scenar-ios) and precipitation year types (wet, normal, and dry seasons) in the North China Plain. Model evaluations demon-strated that simulated soil temperature, soil moisture, daily N2Oflux, yield, and cumulative N2O emissions weregenerally in close agreement with measurements fromfield experiment over three growing seasons. By adopting simu-lation scenarios analysis, the model was then used to explore the effects of irrigation and N fertilizer inputs to balanceyield and N2O emissions from winter wheat growing season. Based on reduced water and fertilizer inputs and N2Oemissions with little yield penalty, recommended management practices included application of MI-N150 in wet season,CI-N120 in both normal and dry seasons, and CI-N150 for +0 to +2.0 degrees C scenarios.

Impacts of Irrigation Managements on Soil CO2 Emission and Soil CH4 Uptake of Winter Wheat Field in the North China Plain. The North China Plain is an important irrigated agricultural area in China. However, the effects of irrigation management on carbon emission are not well documented in this region. Due to the uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall, irrigation is mainly concentrated in the winter wheat growing season in the North China Plain. In this study, we estimated CO2 emission and soil CH4 uptake from winter wheat fields with different irrigation methods and scheduling treatments using the static chamber-gas chromatography method from April to May 2017 and 2018. Treatments included three irrigation methods (surface drip, sprinkler, and border) and three irrigation scheduling levels that initiated as soon as the soil moisture drained to 50%, 60%, and 70% of the field capacity for a 0-100 cm soil profile were tested. The results showed that both the irrigation methods and scheduling significantly influenced (p < 0.05) the cumulative CO2 and CH4 emission, grain yield, global warming potential (GWP), GWP Intensity (GWPI), GWPI per unit irrigation applied, and water use efficiency (WUE). Compared to 60% and 70% FC, 50% FC irrigation scheduling de-creased accumulated CH4 uptake 26.8-30.3% and 17.8-25.4%, and reduced accumulated CO2 emissions 7.0-15.3% and 12.6-19.4%, respectively. Conversely, 50% FC reduced GWP 6.5-13.3% and 12.5-19.4% and lower grain yield 10.4-19.7% and 8.5-16.6% compared to 60% and 70% FC irrigation scheduling in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Compared to sprinkler irrigation and border irrigation, drip irrigation at 60% FC increased the accumulated CH4 uptake 11.3-12.1% and 1.9-5.5%, while reduced the accumulated CO2 emissions from 7.5-8.8% and 10.1-12.1% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Moreover, drip irrigation at 60% FC increased grain yield 5.2-7.5% and 6.3-6.8%, WUE 0.9-5.4% and 5.7-7.4%, and lowered GWP 8.0-9.8% and 10.1-12.0% compared to sprinkler and border irrigation in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The interaction of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods significantly impacted accumulated CH4 uptake, cumulative CO2 amount, and GWP in 2018 only while grain yield and WUE in the entire study. Overall, drip irrigation at 60% FC is the optimal choice in terms of higher grain yield, WUE, and mitigating GWP and GWPI from winter wheat fields in North China Plain.

Greenhouse gas production, diffusion and consumption in a soil profile under maize and wheat production. Agricultural soil emissions are a balance between sinks and sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The fluxes of GHGs from soils are complex and spatially and temporally heterogenous. While the soil surface is the exchange site with the atmosphere and is commonly where GHG fluxes are measured, it is important to consider processes occurring throughout the soil profile. To reduce emissions and improve agricultural sustainability we need to better understand the drivers and dynamics (production, consumption, diffusion) of these gases within the soil profile. Due to the heterogeneous nature of GHG processes at small to large scales, it is important to test how these processes differ with depth in different systems. In this study, we measured in situ CO2, N2O and CH4 concentration gradients as a function of soil depth over subsequent maize and wheat growing seasons with active gas samplers inserted into an arable field at 10, 20, 30 and 50 cm depths. We found N2O and CH4 concentrations increased with depth, but only CO2 concentrations differed with depth between growing seasons due likely to differences in soil diffusivity driven by soil conditions. Using the concentration gradient method (GM), the CO2 fluxes at each depth and their contribution to the surface flux were calculated and validated against a chamber method (CM) measured surface flux. We found the GM estimated surface CO2 flux was only 6 % different in the wheat, but 28 % lower than the surface measured flux in the maize growing season, due to drought conditions reducing the accuracy of the GM. Finally, we measured fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 in ambient and highly concentrated headspaces in laboratory mesocosms over a 72 h incubation period. We provide evidence of depth dependent CH4 oxidation and N2O consumption and possibly CO2 fixation. In conclusion, our study provides valuable information on the applicability of the GM and further evidence of the GHG production, consumption and diffusion mechanisms that occur deeper in the soil in a temperate arable context.

Future climate change impacts on grain yield and agricultural greenhouse-gas emissions under different cropping systems in the North China Plain. Context The winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping system with high input and output in the North China Plain (NCP) is the primary source of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. As the climate warms, the NCP faces the challenges of improving agricultural productivity, while reducing carbon footprint.Aims This research aims to explore an optimal cropping system that achieves a balance between high yield and reduced environmental impact, while promoting sustainable agricultural development.Methods On the basis of climate data from 27 global climate models (GCMs), we evaluated the impacts of future climatic change on yield and GHG emissions of five cropping systems by using the Agricultural Production System Simulator Model (APSIM). The cropping systems included winter wheat-summer maize (1Y2MS0, 1-year cycle), winter wheat-summer maize-fallow without/with straw mulching-early maize (2Y3MS0/2Y3MS1, 2-year cycle), early maize-fallow without/with straw mulching (1Y1MS0/1Y1MS1, 1-year cycle).Key results Future climatic change was beneficial for wheat and maize yields for all cropping systems under most climate scenarios. GHG emissions from all cropping systems were projected to increase in the future. However, compared with the conventional intensive 1Y2MS0, cropping system adjustment could decrease indirect emissions from agricultural input, thereby reducing GHG emissions by 21.6-46.0%. Straw mulching during fallow period might slightly increase N2O emissions but could enhance soil carbon sequestration.Conclusions We suggested that 2Y3MS1 was the optimal planting system in the NCP to balance grain yields and GHG emissions in the future.Implications This study can inform cleaner production developments to reduce carbon footprint of regional multi-crop systems.

Efficiency of 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole Phosphate in Mitigating N2O Emission Varied with Irrigation Regime in Drip-Irrigated Wheat Field. Agricultural soils are major anthropogenic sources of N2O emissions. The application of nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) has been proved to be an effective management measure to mitigate N2O emissions. However, the influence mechanism of DMPP on the mitigation of soil N2O emissions under different irrigation regimes remains unclear. Therefore, a lysimeter experiment was conducted to study the effects of irrigation level (lower irrigation limits of 75%, 65%, and 55% of field capacity (FC), signed as WH, WM, and WL) and DMPP addition (0% and 1% of N application, signed as D0 and D1) on N2O emissions, soil environmental factors such as ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), water-filled pore space (WFPS), soil temperature, and the abundances of N2O-related genes (AOA amoA, AOB amoA, nirS, and nirK). The results showed that soil N2O emissions increased with the increasing of irrigation level. The efficiency of DMPP mitigating N2O emissions varies depending on irrigation regime. Compared to D0, D1 strongly decreased cumulative N2O emissions by 11.27%, 18.96%, and 15.05% in the WL, WM, and WH conditions, respectively. Meanwhile, D1 caused an obvious reduction in the AOB amoA gene by 29.73%, 47.02%, and 22.41%, respectively, but there was no significant effect on the AOA amoA gene. D1 was effective in decreasing nirS and nirK genes except in the WL condition; the percentages of reduction were 48.45%, 40.84% and 37.18%, 44.97% in the WM and WH conditions, respectively. In addition, D1 caused an increase in NH4+-N content and a decrease in NO3--N content, WFPS, and soil temperature in all irrigation regimes. A higher significant correlation was observed between N2O emissions and NH4+-N and AOB amoA in the WL and WM conditions, while a significant correlation was observed between N2O emissions and NO3--N, nirK, and nirS in the WH condition. It was revealed that with the increase in irrigation level, the main source of N2O emissions might change from nitrification to denitrification. Overall, our study indicated that in the WL and WM conditions, the mitigation of N2O emissions by DMPP was primarily attributable to the inhibition of the AOB amoA gene, whereas the inhibition of nirS and nirK genes was likely the dominant mechanism in the WH condition. The findings of this study will provide a theoretical basis for the application of a nitrification inhibitor for drip-irrigated winter wheat fields in the North China Plain.

A spatially referenced water and nitrogen management model (WNMM) for (irrigated) intensive cropping systems in the North China Plain. A spatially referenced biophysical model, the water and nitrogen management model (WNMM), was developed and shown to simulate dynamic soil water movement and soil-crop carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling under a given agricultural management, for the purpose of identifying optimal strategies for managing water and fertiliser N under intensive cropping systems (mainly wheat-maize) in the North China Plain and other regions in the world. A uniform data structure, ARC GRID ASCII format, was used both in GIS and WNMM for achieving a close Model-GIS coupling. A significant part of WNMM adopts and modifies concepts and components from widely used models, with a focus on soil N transformations. WNMM simulates the key processes of water dynamics in the surface and subsurface of soils: including evapotranspiration, canopy interception, water movement and groundwater fluctuations; heat transfer and solute transport; crop growth; C and N cycling in the soil-crop system; and agricultural management practices (crop rotation, irrigation, fertiliser application, harvest and tillage). The model runs on a daily time step at any desired scale and is driven by lumped variables (meteorological and crop biological data) in text data format, and spatial variables (soil and agricultural management) in ARC GRID ASCII format. In particular, WNMM simulates all key N transformations in agricultural fields, including mineralisation of fresh crop residue N and soil organic N, formation of soil organic N, immobilisation in biomass, nitrification, ammonia (NH3) volatilisation, denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. WNMM has been successfully applied in Fengqiu County, Henan Province and Luancheng County, Hebei Province, China at site and regional scales. The key WNMM components were intensively calibrated and verified against comprehensive field measurements of soil water content, evapotranspiration, crop leaf area index and yield, NH3 volatilisation, denitrification and N2O emissions as well as nitrate (NO3-)-N concentrations in the soil solution. A sensitivity analysis showed that WNMM was sensitive to changes in meteorological variables, soil hydraulic properties, land use and agricultural management. At the site scale, WNMM simulated well soil water content, crop growth and yield, NH3 volatilisation and soil NO3--N concentration. There was uncertainty in simulating soil denitrification and N2O emissions, when the predicted peaks of denitrification and N2O emissions at very wet conditions could not be confirmed because of limitations in the acetylene-inhibition method for measuring denitrification. At county scale, WNMM simulation of crop yield in Fengqiu County explained 22% of the variation in observed crop yields, and 31% of crop yield variation in Luancheng County where soil variation was less. These results are considered acceptable because factors such as soil salinity and other nutrient deficiencies, which have not been considered in this version of WNMM, may play a role. The source code for the WNMM is available on request. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Greenhouse Gas Flux and Crop Productivity after 10 Years of Reduced and No Tillage in a Wheat-Maize Cropping System. Appropriate tillage plays an important role in mitigating the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) in regions with higher crop yields, but the emission situations of some reduced tillage systems such as subsoiling, harrow tillage and rotary tillage are not comprehensively studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the emission characteristics of GHG (CH4 and N2O) under four reduced tillage systems from October 2007 to August 2009 based on a 10-yr tillage experiment in the North China Plain, which included no-tillage (NT) and three reduced tillage systems of subsoil tillage (ST), harrow tillage (HT) and rotary tillage (RT), with the conventional tillage (CT) as the control. The soil under the five tillage systems was an absorption sink for CH4 and an emission source for N2O. The soil temperature positive impacted on the CH4 absorption by the soils of different tillage systems, while a significant negative correlation was observed between the absorption and soil moisture. The main driving factor for increased N2O emission was not the soil temperature but the soil moisture and the content of nitrate. In the two rotation cycle of wheat-maize system (10/2007-10/2008 and 10/2008-10/2009), averaged cumulative uptake fluxes of CH4 under CT, ST, HT, RT and NT systems were approximately 1.67, 1.72, 1.63, 1.77 and 1.17 t ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, and meanwhile, approximately 4.43, 4.38, 4.47, 4.30 and 4.61 t ha(-1) year(-1) of N2O were emitted from soil of these systems, respectively. Moreover, they also gained 33.73, 34.63, 32.62, 34.56 and 27.54 t ha(-1) yields during two crop-rotation periods, respectively. Based on these comparisons, the rotary tillage and subsoiling mitigated the emissions of CH4 and N2O as well as improving crop productivity of a wheat-maize cropping system.

Long-term manure application increased greenhouse gas emissions but had no effect on ammonia volatilization in a Northern China upland field. The impacts of manure application on soil ammonia (NH3) volatilization and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are of interest for both agronomic and environmental reasons. However, how the swine manure addition affects greenhouse gas and N emissions in North China Plain wheat fields is still unknown. A long-term fertilization experiment was carried out on a maize-wheat rotation systemin Northern China (Zea mays L-Triticum aestivum L.) from 1990 to 2017. The experiment included four treatments: (1) No fertilizer (CK), (2) single application of chemical fertilizers (NPK), (3) NPK plus 22.5 t/ha swine manure (NPKM), (4) NPK plus 33.7 t/ha swine manure (NPKM+). A short-termfertilization experiment was conducted from 2016 to 2017 using the same treatments in a field that had been abandoned for decades. The emissions of NH3 and GHGs were measured during the wheat season from 2016 to 2017. Results showed that after long-term fertilization the wheat yields for NPKM treatment were 7105 kg/ha, which were higher than NPK (3880 kg/ha) and NPKM+ treatments (5518 kg/ha). The wheat yields were similar after short-term fertilization (6098-6887 kg/ha). The NH3-N emission factors (EFamm) for NPKM and NPKM+ treatments (1.1 and 1.1-1.4%, respectively) were lower than NPK treatment (2.2%) in both the long and short-term fertilization treatments. In the long-and short-term experiments the nitrous oxide (N2O) emission factors (EFnit) for NPKM+ treatment were 4.2% and 3.7%, respectively, which were higher than for the NPK treatment (3.5% and 2.5%, respectively) and the NPKM treatment (3.6% and 2.2%, respectively). In addition, under long and short-term fertilization, the greenhouse gas intensities for the NPKM+ treatment were 33.7 and 27.0 kg CO2-eq/kg yield, respectively, which were higher than for the NPKM treatment (22.8 and 21.1 kg CO2-eq/kg yield, respectively). These results imply that excessive swine manure application does not increase yield but increases GHG emissions. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Can conservation agriculture mitigate climate change and reduce environmental impacts for intensive cropping systems in North China Plain?. Determining appropriate farming management practices to adapt to climate change with lower environmental costs is important for sustainable agricultural production. In this study, a long-term experiment (1985-2019) was conducted under different management practices combining fertilization rate (no, low and high N fertilizer, N0, N1 and N2), straw additions (no, low and high addition, S0, S1 and S2) with conservation tillage (no-tillage, NT) in the North China Plain (NCP). The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model was firstly evaluated using the experimental data, and then applied to simulate the changes of crop yields, soil organic carbon (SOC), and N2O emissions under different management practices combined with climate change scenarios, under low and high emission scenarios of societal development pathways (SSP245 and SSP585, respectively) with climate projections from 2031 to 2100. Under the low emission scenario (SSP245), wheat yields were the highest with the NT-N1-S2 treatment (a 23% increase relative to the baseline (1981-2010)). For maize yields, the NT-N1-S1 treatment increased 46% relative to baseline under the SSP585, whereas, the yields increased less in all treatments under SSP245-2040s. The SOC was predicted to increase by 6-60% by 2100 under SSP245. Straw addition and tillage were the main factors influencing SOC. N fertilizer was the most important driver for wheat and maize yields, however, N2O emissions from soil increased with increased application of N fertilizer. Therefore, the no-tillage method under low N fertilizer and high straw addition (NT-N1-S2) is recommended to promote crop yields and substantially increase SOC under SSP245 and SSP585. Conservation agriculture practices can potentially offset crop yield reductions, increase soil quality, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the NCP, and ensure crop production to meet the growing demand for food under future climate change.

Measurements of N2O emissions from different vegetable fields on the North China Plain. Few studies have measured the N2O emission fluxes from vegetable fields. In order to identify the characteristics and the influencing factors of N2O emissions from different vegetable fields, we measured N2O emissions for a full year from four typical fields, including an open-ground vegetable field that has produced vegetables for over 20 years (OV20), a recently developed open-ground vegetable field that was converted from a maize field three years earlier (OV3), a recently developed greenhouse vegetable field that was converted from a maize field 3 years earlier (GV3) and a typical local maize field (Maize). Four different fertilization treatments were set additionally in the recently developed open-ground vegetable field. These were: no fertilizer or manure (OV3_CK), manure only (OV3_M) and the combination of manure with different rates of chemical fertilizer application (OV3_MF1 and OV3_MF3). The results showed that N2O emission fluxes fluctuated between 03 +/- 0.1 and 912.4 +/- 80.0 mg N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) with the highest emission peak occurring after fertilization followed by irrigation. Nitrogen application explained 64.6-84.5% of the N2O emission in the vegetable fields. The magnitude of the emission peaks depended on the nitrogen application rate and the duration of the emission peaks was mainly associated with soil temperature when appropriate irrigation was given after fertilization. The N2O emission peaks occurred later and lasted for a longer period when the soil temperature was <24 degrees C in May. However, emission peaks occurred earlier and lasted for a shorter period when the soil temperature was around 25-33 degrees C from June to August. The annual N2O emissions from the fertilized vegetable fields were 1.68-238 times higher than that from the maize field, which had an emission value of 2.88 +/- 0.10 kg N ha(-1) a(-1). The N2O emission factor (EF) of manure nitrogen was 0.07% over the whole year, but was 0.11% and 0.02% in the spring cucumber season and the autumn cabbage season, respectively. The EF of chemical nitrogen was 1.10-1.78% for the vegetable field over the whole year and it was higher in recently developed vegetable field than in the established field (1.54-1.78% vs. 1.10%). Vegetable fields may contribute greatly to the national greenhouse gas inventories due to the high fertilizer application rates, frequent irrigation and an increased number of tillage-planting cycles.

Long-term saline water irrigation has the potential to balance greenhouse gas emissions and cotton yield in North China plain. Saline water has proven to be one of the alternative sources of freshwater for agricultural irrigation in water-scarce areas. However, the changes in farmland ecology caused by saline water irrigation remain unclear. In this study, six irrigation water salinities (CK: 1.3 dS m(-1), S1: 3.4 dS m(-1), S2: 7.1 dS m(-1), S3: 10.6 dS m(-1), S4: 14.1 dS m(-1), S5: 17.7 dS m(-1)) were set in a three-year (2019, 2021-2022) experiment to investigate their effects on soil environment and greenhouse gas emissions in cotton fields under long-term saline water irrigation. Results show that soil salinity in the same layer increased as increasing water salinity. Soil moisture of S3-S5 increased significantly by 4.99-12.94%. There was no significant difference in soil organic matter content between CK and S1. Saline water irrigation increased soil ammonium nitrogen content by 0.57-49.26%, while decreasing nitrate nitrogen content by 1.43-32.03%. Soil CO2 and N2O emissions and CH4 uptake were lower in S1-S5 than in CK at different cotton growth stages. In addition, saline water irrigation reduced the global warming potential by 6.93-53.86%. A structural equation model was developed to show that soil salinity, moisture, and ammonium nitrogen content were negatively correlated with global warming potential, while organic matter and nitrate nitrogen had positive effects on global warming potential. Considering the comprehensive perspectives of gas emissions and cotton yield, irrigation water with salinity less than 10.6 dS m(-1) could effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cotton fields while maintaining stable cotton yields in the experimental area and similar region.

Also the optimal microbial fertilization and tillage with the lowest CF, highest climate-based ecosystem services and highest crop yield were determined. The results showed that compared with microbial organic fertilization, the use of microbial decomposing agents increased soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration (2582.1-2909.9 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1)) and reduced CF (0.11-0.12 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) grain). Chemical fertilization was the largest contributor to total CF (27.5-56.7%), which decreased with decreasing chemical fertilization. Climate-based ecosystem services of microbial fertilization with rotary tillage (1689.9-1795.6 US$ ha(-1) yr(-1)) were significantly higher than those of chemical fertilization. In the limited system boundary of wheat-maize cropping, microbial decomposing agent MA (of 30 L ha(-1)) with rotary tillage had the highest grain production, GHG emission mitigation and climate-based ecosystem services enhancement.

Effects of straw mulching and nitrogen application rates on crop yields, fertilizer use efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions of summer maize. Although straw mulching and nitrogen applications are extensively practiced in the agriculture sector, large uncer-tainties remain about their impacts on crop yields and especially the environment. The responses of summer maize yields, fertilizer use efficiency, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the North China Plain (NCP) to two straw management practices (S0: no straw and S1: straw mulching) and two nitrogen application rates (N1: 180 and N2: 210 kg N ha(-1)) were investigated in field tests in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The highest yields and partial factor productivity (PFP) were obtained by S1N1, followed by S1N2, S0N1, and S0N2. S1N2 had the highest CO2 emissions and greatest CH4 uptake, S0N1 had the lowest CO2 emissions, and S0N2 had the smallest CH4 uptake. The highest and lowest N2O emissions were found in S0N1 and S1N1, respectively. The S1N2 treatment, an extensively applied practice, had the greatest global warming poten-tial (GWP), which was 70.3 % larger than S1N1 and two times more than S0N1 and S0N2. The largest GHG emission intensity (GHGI) of 19.4 was found in the S1N2 treatment, while the other three treatments, S0N1, S0N2, and S1N1, had a GHGI of 10.1, 10.7, and 10.7, respectively according to three tested results. In conclusion, S1N1 treatment achieved a better trade-off between crop yields and GHG emissions of summer maize in NCP.

Spartina alterniflora invasions impact CH4 and N2O fluxes from a salt marsh in eastern China. Spartina alterniflora, an invasive species originating from North America, has spread widely along the eastern coast of China. However, the impacts of S. alterniflora invasions on CH4 and N2O fluxes from salt marshes in eastern China are not fully understood. We conducted a field experiment in three treatments (transparent, opaque, and clipping) to compare the CH4 and N2O fluxes from S. alterniflora community with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities and the mudflat in a coastal wetland of eastern China over one year. CH4 flux from the S. alterniflora community was higher than the S. salsa community and mudflat but lower than the P. australis community. The opaque treatment did not significantly alter CH4 flux, except for the S. salsa community. Clipping significantly decreased CH4 flux from the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities but increased CH4 flux from the S. salsa community. In contrast, N2O fluxes in the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities were lower than for the S. salsa community and mudflat. The opaque treatment did not significantly change N2O fluxes across communities. Clipping significantly increased mean N2O fluxes from the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities but did not significantly change N2O flux in the S. salsa community. CH4 flux was positively related to the aboveground biomass and negatively related to density, whereas N2O flux was negatively related to aboveground biomass and positively related to density. Meanwhile, CH4 flux was strongly dependent on temperature, soil moisture and water depth (P < 0.05), while N2O fluxes under the transparent and opaque chambers were significantly related to water depth (P < 0.05), but N2O flux under the clipping treatment was not significantly related to environmental factors (P > 0.05). Overall, CH4 and N2O fluxes from this coastal wetland were 17.38g m (2) and -36.64 mg m (2), respectively, indicating that S. alterniflora invasions in this salt marsh in eastern China could play a negligible role in emitting CH4 and a significant role in absorbing N2O when compared with other studies worldwide.

Model development in DNDC for the prediction of evapotranspiration and water use in temperate field cropping systems. This paper integrates recent research to improve, test, and verify the process based DeNtrification DeComposition (DNDC) model to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) through a revised FAO Penman -Monteith approach. ET estimates along with biomass and soil water content for spring wheat and corn were improved and found to be in good agreement with the observations at three field sites in eastern Canada (Ottawa). The statistical evaluations (RMSE (mm day(-1)) and R-2) of ET for the newly revised model (0.88 and 0.76 for corn and 0.93 and 0.78 for wheat) showed improvements over DNDC93 (1.95 and 0.22 for corn and 1.62 and 0.09 for wheat) which used the Thornthwaite equation for estimating potential evapotranspiration. In addition, evaluations of water use efficiency for corn and wheat showed good agreement between observations and the modified model. The study demonstrates the inter-dependencies of ET with biomass production and soil/atmosphere water balance. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Modeling Adaptive Strategies on Maintaining Wheat-Corn Production and Reducing Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions under Climate Change. Climate change has posed serious challenges to food production and sustainable development. We evaluated crop yields, N2O emissions, and soil organic carbon (SOC) in a typical wheat-corn rotation system field on the North China Plain on a 50-year scale using the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model and proposed adaptive strategies for each climate scenarios. The study showed a good consistency between observations and simulations (R-2 > 0.95 and nRMSE < 30%). Among the twelve climate scenarios, we explored ten management practices under four climate scenarios (3 degrees C temperature change: P/T-3 and P/T+3; 30% precipitation change: 0.7P/T and 1.3P/T), which have a significant impact on crop yields and the net greenhouse effect. The results revealed that changing the crop planting time (CP) and using cold-resistant (CR) varieties could reduce the net greenhouse effect by more than 1/4 without sacrificing crop yields under P/T-3. Straw return (SR) minimized the negative impact on yields and the environment under P/T+3. Fertigation (FG) and Drought-Resistant (DR) varieties reduced the net greenhouse effect by more than 8.34% and maintained yields under 0.7P/T. SR was most beneficial to carbon sequestration, and yields were increased by 3.87% under 1.3P/T. Multiple adaptive strategies should be implemented to balance yields and reduce the environmental burden under future climate change.

Ammonia mitigation measures reduce greenhouse gas emissions from an integrated manure-cropland system. Increasing use of manure nutrients in crop production and decreasing the input of chemical fertilizers, is a promising way to achieve a more circular economy and more sustainable food systems. The integrated effects of amended composting manure with additives and a 50% substitution of chemical fertilizer nitrogen (N) input by amended manure N input to cropland were proved to halve ammonia (NH3) emissions from an integrate manure-cropland system. However, the accompanied impacts of these measures on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the integrate manure-cropland system have not been well quantified. Here, we examined the effects of improved manure storage and treatment and its usage at field on GHG emissions from a system perspective, based on a two-year experiment in the North China Plain (NCP). Manure storage and treatment included natural storage (NS) and composting with straw, with or without amendment by zeolite (Z) and superphosphate (SP). Manure products were applied as basal fertilizer for both crops. Results showed that CH4 was the dominant GHG source in the natural storage treatment, whereas N2O dominated in the manure composting treatments. Amending manure with straw, Z and SP stimulated 15-48 times N2O emission and decreased CH4 emissions by 82%-91% during storage and treatment. Replacement of 50% synthetic fertilizer N by manure N decreased total system GHG emissions by 25%-34%. Differences between composted manure treatments in total system GHG emissions were relatively small, although comparatively higher in amended manure treatments; however, they promoted greater soil organic carbon sink activity, resulting in no significant difference in net global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI). Application of amended manure produced high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in the integrated crop-manure system. The NH3 mitigation approach of replacing 50% of synthetic fertilizer N by amended manure N synergistically decreased total GHG emissions, increased system NUE and also increased the net economic benefit by 5%-11% over the 2 years of the experiment.

Optimizing crop rotation increases soil carbon and reduces GHG emissions without sacrificing yields. Enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) while concurrently reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and without compromising yield is a contemporary challenge for many agricultural sectors across the globe. In China, resolving the \"carbon-food\" nexus is a key pillar of government policies aimed at constraining \"Carbon Peak\" and delivering \"Carbon Neutrality\". The present study explores the potential to increase SOC stocks while reducing GHGs emissions, without sacrificing crop yields considering crop rotation optimization under different irrigation managements in the North China Plain (NCP) based on a 6-year experiment. We found higher crop yields for the irrigated treatments compared with the rainfed treatments, demonstrating that rainfed crops were constrained by water deficit stress in the region. Yield was highest in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation (WM), followed by yields of the winter wheat-summer soybean (WS), while the average yields of winter wheat-summer maize -spring maize (WMMs) were lowest. SOC stocks in the surface soil (0-20 cm) increased for the irrigated treat-ments, but soil carbon sequestration (i.e. the rate of SOC stocks change over time) for the rainfed treatments decreased for all treatments. SOC stocks for WMMs was greatest of all treatments, leading to the highest carbon sustainability index (CSI) for this treatment. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 23-57% higher in the irrigated treatments than the rainfed treatments for the three rotations, which was highest in WMMs and lowest in WS. Carbon footprints (CFs) were highest in WS and lowest in WMMs. Overall, we found that increasing SOC stocks reduced CFs and increased yield. WMMs with irrigation was the most effective treatment for promoting SOC sequestration and mitigating GHG emissions with relatively high yield in this study, suggesting that crop rota-tions that are (1) more intensive and (2) grow more aboveground biomass are more likely to promulgate lower CFs and contribute towards national emissions abatement targets, such as those aimed at Net Zero.

Optimizing irrigation management sustained grain yield, crop water productivity, and mitigated greenhouse gas emissions from the winter wheat field in North China Plain. Climate change caused by increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has led to frequent extreme weather events, which seriously threaten sustainable agricultural production. Therefore, it is essential to optimize proper irrigation management to improve the grain yield, crop water productivity (WPc), economic crop water productivity (EWPc), and lower global warming potential (GWP) and GWP Intensity (GWPI). The effect of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on GHG emissions remains largely unknown, even though this knowledge is essential to optimize the irrigation management. To address this knowledge gap, a field experiment was carried out in the North China Plain (NCP) for three winter wheat seasons to measure the influence of different irrigation methods and irrigation scheduling on WPc, EWPc, GWP, and GWPI. Irrigation scheduling including 50%, 60%, and 70% of the field capacity (FC) were kept in the main plots and irrigation methods, including sprinkler, drip, and flood irrigation methods in the sub-plots. The results revealed that relative to sprinkler irrigation at 60% FC, drip irrigation at 60% FC significantly (p < 0.05) improved the yield 4.89-7.52%, WPc 1.0-5.4%, EWPc 1.1-5.49%, lower GWP 7.47-9.34%, and GWPI 10.92-15.23%. Compared with flood irrigation at 60% FC, drip irrigation at 60% FC increased grain yield 5.34-6.81%, WPc 5.65-15.1%, EWPc 5.73-15.12%, lower GWP 10.36-15.16%, and GWPI 16.22-19.40%. Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) presented that compared with sprinkler and flood irrigation at 60% FC irrigation scheduling, drip irrigation at 60% FC irrigation scheduling provides the best results for improved the yield, WPc, and EWPc, and optimal balance in GWP and GWPI. Therefore, the irrigation scheduling of 60% FC combined with drip irrigation is suggested for sustained wheat yield, improved WPc and EWPc, and mitigated GWP in the NCP.

Effects of Long-Term Controlled-Release Urea on Soil Greenhouse Gas Emissions in an Open-Field Lettuce System. Controlled-release urea (CRU) fertilizers are widely used in agricultural production to reduce conventional nitrogen (N) fertilization-induced agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and improve N use efficiency (NUE). However, the long-term effects of different CRU fertilizers on GHGs and crop yields in vegetable fields remain relatively unexplored. This study investigated the variations in GHG emissions at four growth stages of lettuce in the spring and autumn seasons based on a five-year field experiment in the North China Plain. Four treatments were setup: CK (without N application), U (conventional urea-N application), ON (20% reduction in urea-N application), CRU (20% reduction in polyurethane-coated urea without topdressing), and DCRU (20% reduction in polyurethane-coated urea containing dicyandiamide [DCD] without topdressing). The results show that N application treatments significantly increased the GHG emissions and the lettuce yield and net yield, and DCRU exhibited the lowest N2O and CO2 emissions, the highest lettuce yield and net yield, and the highest lettuce N content of the N application treatments. When compared to U, the N2O emission peak under CRU and DCRU treatments was notably decreased and delayed, and their average N2O emission fluxes were significantly reduced by 10.20-20.72% and 17.51-29.35%, respectively, leading to a significant reduction in mean cumulative N2O emissions during the 2017-2021 period. When compared to U, the CO2 fluxes of DCRU significantly decreased by 8.0-16.54% in the seedling period, and mean cumulative CO2 emission decreased by 9.28%. Moreover, compared to U, the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of the DCRU treatment was significantly alleviated by 9.02-17.13% and 16.68-20.36%, respectively. Compared to U, the N content of lettuce under DCRU was significantly increased by 6.48-17.25%, and the lettuce net yield was also significantly increased by 5.41-7.71%. These observations indicated that the simple and efficient N management strategy to strike a balance between enhancing lettuce yields and reduce GHG emissions in open-field lettuce fields could be obtained by applying controlled-release urea containing DCD without topdressing.

Comparison of net GHG emissions between separated system and crop-swine integrated system in the North China Plain. Agriculture causes 10-12% of global GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions. GHG emissions from Chinese agriculture have been estimated at 819.97 Mt CO2-equivalence (CO2-eq); among them, total annual GHG emissions from the production of grain and livestock have been estimated at 374 Mt CO2-eq and 445 Mt CO2-eq, respectively. Because of food demand, food production has intensified, resulting in the separation of crop production and livestock rearing. This separation has increased the application of outside resources and agricultural waste, aggravating GHG emissions and other ecological and environmental problems. This research attempts to mitigate GHG emissions by improving soil carbon sequestration of crop production and decreasing emissions from swine-rearing waste. Net GHG emissions (NGHGE) between an integrated system and a separated system are compared in this study from a life-cycle perspective. The causes of different GHG emissions between these two systems are analyzed and mitigation strategies are proposed. The results show that the NGHGE of crop-swine integrated and separated systems were 24,917.95 kg CO2-eq/ha/yr and 27,732.70 kg CO2-eq/ha/yr, respectively, for 215 head of pigs. The integrated system reduced GHG by 1381.33 kg CO2-eq/yr mainly due to the recycling and reuse of pig manure in croplands. Meanwhile, the integrated system increased soil carbon storage by 35.92% compared with the separated system, although it increased soil CH4 and N2O emissions. In conclusion, these results indicate that through a series of methods, such as recycling agricultural waste, the integrated system can reduce net GHG emissions by 10.15% compared with separated systems. Although much work remains to adopt the integrated system to reduce GHG emissions, the crop-swine integrated system should be given priority to mitigate anthropogenic net GHG emissions.

Mitigating Global Warming Potential and Greenhouse Gas Intensities by Applying Composted Manure in Cornfield: A 3-Year Field Study in an Andosol Soil. A 3-year study was conducted in cornfield to evaluate how composted cattle manure application affects net global warming potential (GWP; the sum of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) minus net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI; net GWP per unit of plant biomass yield). In the first experiment, conducted from 2010 to 2012, five fertilization strategies that included an unfertilized control plot, inorganic fertilizer-only plot, two plots with inorganic fertilizer plus composted cattle manure, and composted cattle manure-only plot were established. In the second experiment composted cattle manure was applied in autumn 2012 and the field was subdivided into three plots in spring 2013, with one plot receiving additional composted cattle manure, the second plot received additional inorganic fertilizer and the third plot did not receive any additional fertilization. Fluxes of N2O, CH4 and CO2 were measured using the static closed chamber method. NECB was calculated as carbon (C) inputs minus C output (where a negative value indicates net C loss). In experiment 1, manure application significantly increased NECB and reduced net GWP by more than 30% in each of the three years of the study. GHGI in the manure-amended plots was lower than in other plots, except in 2012 when the manure-only plot had higher GHGI than fertilizer-only plot. Application of inorganic fertilizer alone increased GWP by 5% and 20% in 2010 and 2011, but showed a 30% reduction in 2012 relative to the unfertilized control plot. However, due to higher net primary production (NPP), fertilizer-only plot had lower GHGI compared to the control. Application of inorganic fertilizer together with manure showed the greatest potential to reduce GWP and GHGI, while increasing NPP and NECB. In experiment 2, additional manure or inorganic fertilizer application in spring increased NPP by a similar amount, but additional manure application also increased NECB, and decreased GWP and GHGI. Manure application, as a partial substitute or supplemental fertilizer, shows potential to mitigate GWP and GHGI.

Soil greenhouse gas emissions, yield, and water-use efficiency affected by maize-soybean intercropping under long-term nitrogen fertilization. Context: Intercropping is widely practiced in many parts of the world due to its high resource-use efficiency, increased productivity, and numerous other agronomic benefits compared to monoculture. However, the interactions between intercropping and varied nitrogen (N) levels under long-term fertilization, particularly concerning soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water-use efficiency (WUE), are not well understood in the semi-arid North China Plain region. Objective: This study aimed to quantify the effects of maize-soybean intercropping and varying N levels under long-term N fertilization on soil GHG emissions, crop productivity, and WUE. Methods: A two-year field experiment was conducted using three cropping systems: maize monocrop, soybean monocrop, and maize-soybean intercrop, combined with four N levels: 0 (control, N0), 100 (N100), 150 (N150), and 200 (N200) kg N ha- 1 per growing season. All crops were managed using recommended practices. Results: Maize monocropping consistently emitted higher levels of N2O and CO2 than soybean monocropping and maize-soybean intercropping systems. Intercropping reduced cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions by 28 % and 15 %, respectively, compared to maize monocropping. Increasing N rates led to higher GHG emissions, with N200 treatment emitting 127 % and 71 % more N2O and 10.7 % and 4.1 % more CO2 than N100 and N150, respectively. Intercropped maize increased grain yield and above-ground biomass by 42 % and 21 % than monoculture maize in 2018 and by 39 % and 22 % in 2019, respectively. Although intercropped soybean yielded less biomass and grain, the total LER ranged from 1.11 to 1.37, suggesting that the overall productivity in intercropping was consistently higher than in monocropping. While nitrogen application significantly boosted biomass and grain yield, no difference was found between N150 and N200 treatments, suggesting that a higher N dose beyond N150 offered no additional benefit. Intercropping increased grain WUE by 47 % than maize monocropping. The water equivalent ratio (WER) ranged from 1.13 to 1.41, and the relative water-saving index ranged from -16.5 % to -28.8 %, suggesting that intercropping used water more efficiently, particularly at N150, where the highest WER for grain yield (1.41) and water savings (-28.8 %) were observed among the N rate treatments. Conclusion: Maize-soybean intercropping, combined with moderate N rate (150 kg N ha- 1), offers a sustainable approach to reducing GHG emissions, enhancing crop productivity, and improving water use efficiency in the semi-arid region of northern China.

Herbicide Applications Reduce Gaseous N Losses: A Field Study of Three Consecutive Wheat-Maize Rotation Cycles in the North China Plain. Herbicide residues in farmland soils have attracted a great deal of attention in recent decades. Their accumulation potentially decreases the activity of microbes and related enzymes, as well as disturbs the nitrogen cycle in farmland soils. In previous studies, the influence of natural factors or nitrogen fertilization on the soil nitrogen cycle have frequently been examined, but the role of herbicides has been ignored. This study was conducted to examine the effects of herbicides on NH3 volatilization- and denitrification-related nitrogen loss through three rotation cycles from 2013 to 2016. The four treatments included no urea fertilizer (CK), urea (CN), urea+acetochlor-fenoxaprop-ethyl (AC-FE), and urea+2,4D-dicamba (2,4D-DI) approaches. The results showed that the application of nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased the nitrogen losses from ammonia volatilization and denitrification in the soil. Ammonia volatilization was the main reason for the gaseous loss of urea nitrogen in a wheat-maize rotation system in the North China Plain (NCP), which was significantly higher than the denitrification loss. In the CK treatment, the cumulative nitrogen losses from ammonia volatilization and denitrification during the three crop rotation cycles were 66.64 kg N hm-2 and 8.07 kg N hm-2, respectively. Compared with CK, the nitrogen losses from ammonia volatilization and denitrification under the CN treatment increased 52.62% and 152.88%, respectively. The application of AC-FE and 2,4D-DI significantly reduced the nitrogen gas losses from the ammonia volatilization and denitrification in the soil. Ammonia volatilization reduction mainly occurred during the maize season, and the inhibition rates of AC-FE and 2,4D-DI were 7.72% and 11.80%, respectively, when compared with CN. From the perspective of the entire wheat-maize rotation cycle, the inhibition rates were 5.41% and 7.23% over three years, respectively. Denitrification reduction also mainly occurred in the maize season, with the inhibition rates of AC-FE and 2,4D-DI being 34.12% and 30.94%, respectively, when compared with CN. From the perspective of the entire wheat-maize rotation cycle, the inhibition rates were 28.39% and 28.58% over three years, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates that herbicides could impact the nitrogen cycle of farmland soil ecosystems via the suppression of ammonia volatilization and denitrification rates, thus reducing gaseous N losses and mitigating global climate change.

Optimizing N-fertigation scheduling maintains yield and mitigates global warming potential of winter wheat field in North China Plain. Traditional methods of nitrogen fertilizer (urea) application are major causes of poor nitrogen use and serious greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which translates into global warming. Rational scheduling of nitrogen fertilization is critical for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions as well as ensuring sustainable food production. There is little information on the coupled analysis of global warming potential (GWP) and grain yield (GY) of winter wheat under a drip fertigation system. A two-year field experiment was conducted to determine the effect of split fertigation of nitrogen on GWP and yield of drip-irrigated winter wheat. The 5 levels of nitrogen schedule were as: N0-100 (all N fertilizer was applied as topdressing N), N25-75 (25% as basal N and 75% as topdressing N), N50-50 (50% as basal N and 50% as topdressing N), N75-25 (75% as basal N and 25% as topdressing N), and N100-0 (all N fertilizer was applied as basal and 0% topdressing N). The total nitrogen rate was 240 kg ha(-1). The basal N doses were spread just before sowing and the topdressing N doses were applied through a drip fertigation system. The results revealed that N schedule significantly (P < 0.05) affected GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions, GWP, GY, and subsequently the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). The lowest GWP (125.34 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1)) and GHGI (15.01 kg CO2 eq. Mg-1) were observed in N50-50 and N25-75 N scheduling, respectively. Compared with N100-0, the N scheduling of N25-75 and N50-50 significantly (P < 0.05) reduced GWP by 67.67 and 63.48%, respectively. A significantly higher yield (9.09 tons ha(-1)) was observed in the N50-50 treatment. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) specified that N50-50 N schedule provides the best results for minimized GWP at an acceptable GY. Therefore, the scheduling of 50% applied as basal N and other 50% as topdressing N through N-fertigation would be recommended for sustainable wheat production at a reduced risk of global warming in the North China Plain.

Unlocking soil health: Are microbial functional genes effective indicators?. Soil microbial community plays crucial roles in promoting soil functions and maintaining soil health. Microbial functional gene abundances are actively involved in soil processes which supports soil functions and wider soil health. However, their suitability as indicators to assess soil health is still debatable. In this study, we sampled soils from a 10-year long-term fertilization experiment in a wheat-maize cropping system on the North China Plain. The treatment included no fertilizer (Control), chemical fertilizers only (NPK), NPK + organic manure, NPK + straw, and NPK + manure + straw. We quantified seventeen functional genes involved in carbon (cbbL, GH31), nitrogen (nifH, ureC, chiA, A-amoA, B-amoA, narG, nirK, nirS, norB and nosZ), and phosphorus (gltA, bpp, phoD, phoC, pqqC) cycling. These genes were correlated with a suite of soil properties representing indicators of carbon (total carbon, organic carbon, and permanganate oxidizable carbon, alpha-1,4 glucosidase and carbon dioxide emission), nitrogen (total nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and nitrous oxide emission), and phosphorous (available phosphorus, acid and alkaline phosphatase) pools/cycling. Soil microbial functional genes exhibited high coefficients of variation and strong sensitivity to fertilization treatments, while showing low variability among replicates within the same treatment. The abundances of functional genes, especially GH31, cbbL, B-amoA, chiA, phoC, and phoD were strongly correlated with their proxy indicators of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. In addition, organic fertilization enhanced carbon and nutrients relevant functional gene abundances, generating positive effects on maize yield. These results indicate that microbial functional genes are sensitive to organic inputs and could provide a more detailed and mechanistic understanding of soil processes than conventional indicators by capturing the biochemical processes that govern nutrient dynamics. Our study underscores the potential of microbial functional genes as sensitive and valuable indicators for advancing soil health assessments and management practices.

Integrating agronomic practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while increasing the economic return in a rice-based cropping system. The effective mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from crop cultivation requires an overall consideration, due to the trade-off relationship between GHGs and the mitigation measures sometimes undermining grain yields and economic returns. To explore the maximum potential of GHG mitigation without sacrificing economic returns, we investigated the GHG emissions, crop yields and economic returns over two years in three rice-cropping systems (rice-wheat, RW; rice-fava bean, RB; and rice-fallow, RF). Different N fertilization levels and straw incorporation methods were employed in each of the rice-cropping systems at the study site, in the Taihu Lake region (TLR) of China. Bean straw produced in the RB system was fermented aerobically before incorporation, while straws produced in the RW and RF systems were directly incorporated into the soils. Relative to the traditional RW system, methane emissions during the rice seasons were significantly reduced by 29-44% in the RB system; annual N inputs were reduced by 43%; annual nitrous oxide emissions for N fertilization treatments were decreased by 56-69%; and the average rice yield was increased by 5.2%. As a, result, the GHG intensity (GHGI) was significantly reduced by 11-41%, and the annual net economic benefit (NEB) was increased by 22-94%. Compared with the RW system, the GHGI in the RF system was increased by 8-30% and the NEB was decreased by 3-33%. Considering the current rice/wheat production practices employed in the TLR, the GHGI could be reduced by 26% while the NEB could be improved by 23%, with an annual reduction in the N application rate (currently 525 kg N ha(-1)) by 20% and the conversion of the RW systems into RB systems that use straw fermentation. The results of this study suggest that high economic return and GHG mitigation could be simultaneously achieved by the integrated adoption of reasonable reduction in N application rates, the use of appropriate rice-cropping systems and by employing eco-friendly straw management.

Effects of micro-sprinkling with different irrigation levels on winter wheat grain yield and greenhouse gas emissions in the North China Plain. Increasing scarcity of irrigation water is threatening global wheat production and sustainability. Accordingly, the water-saving irrigation regime has been strongly advocated to reduce irrigation water consumption. However, studies about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the winter wheat cropping system with water-saving irri-gation are rare. In this study, five irrigation regimes, wherein the supplementary irrigation brought soil water content in the 0-40 cm profile to 65% (K65) field water capacity (FC), 70% (K70) FC, 75% (K75) FC, 80% (K80) FC, and 85% (K85) FC at the joining and anthesis stages in 2019-2022. K75 improved the leaf area index at the grain-filling stage and dry matter remobilization pre-anthesis and dry matter assimilation post-anthesis. Corre-spondingly, 5.48-23.96% increases in grain yield were observed for K75 compared with K65, K70, and K85 treatments, mainly attributable to increased number of kernels and 1000-kernel weight. Compared with the K80 and K85 treatments, K75 treatment had the most prominent effect on the instability of soil carbon, nitrogen, and moisture content, as reflected in decreased cumulative emissions of soil N2O (5.15-15.65%) and CH4 (6.07-44.07%). It also decreased the global warming potential (6.17-19.53%). However, there were no signif-icant differences among K65, K70, and K75 treatments. In addition, the K75 treatment decreased greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) by 5.04-25.25% compared with K65, K70, K80 and K85 treatments. Collectively, based on the combined effects of grain yield and greenhouse gas emissions improvement, we recommend K75 as a sustainable irrigation regime that can improve grain yield and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

Trade-off between soil carbon emission and sequestration for winter wheat under reduced irrigation: The role of soil amendments. Underground water source in North China Plain (NCP) is limited and extensively explored for wheat irrigation, which has caused high carbon emission. Reduced irrigation strategies and soil amendments have been advocated for sustainable agricultural production. However, the interactive effects of irrigation schedule and soil amendment on direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and carbon footprint (CF) have rarely been systematically quantified. A two-year field study was conducted in wheat season under three irrigation schedules (W0: pre-sowing irrigation only, W1: pre-sowing + jointing irrigation, and W2: pre-sowing + jointing + anthesis irrigation) and three fertilization types (Fc: chemical fertilizer only, Fm: chemical fertilizer + manure, and Fb: chemical fertilizer + biochar). In the Fc treatments, direct emissions from soil N2O and CH4 significantly decreased from W2 or W1 to W0, but SOC also decreased from W2 to W1 or W0. Net GHG emissions (GHGnet) was 14.6% higher in W1 +Fc but 6.0% lower in W0 +Fc compared with W2 +Fc because of the difference in electricity use for irrigation. Notably, the CF in W1 +Fc and W0 +Fc was 40.9% and 63.8% higher than in W2 +Fc mainly due to yield loss. Compared with Fc, direct emissions averaged 63.1% higher under Fm coupled with increased soil nitrate content, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN). The SOC significantly decreased from W0, W1 to W2 under Fm. Under the identical irrigation level, SOC stocks were 40.0% and 53.9% higher in Fm than in Fc under W1 and W0, while no significant difference under W2. Relative to Fc treatments, under Fm, CF was 28.5% lower in W0 but 6.2% and 45.7% higher in W1 and W2. Compared with Fc, direct emissions averaged 7.7% lower under Fb due to smaller MBN and higher soil porosity under Fb. The CF was lower in Fb than in Fc resulting from SOC increase. Thus, manure and biochar amendment could decrease CF following reduced irrigation, although manure application increased the risk of C loss.

Quantitative contributions of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices to yield and global warming potential in rice-winter wheat rotation ecosystems. Context: With the growing demand for food and the threat from climate change, increasing grain yields with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an important target. Yet, the quantitative effects of climate change and management practices on yield and global warming potential (GWP) of rice-winter wheat rotations are still uncertain. Objective: To investigate the key factors influencing the tradeoffs between yield and GHG of rice-winter wheat ecosystems in mid-eastern China over the two periods. Methods: In this study, the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was used to examine the spatiotemporal county-scale variations in yields of rice-winter wheat rotations and associated GHG (CH4, N2O) and GHG intensity (GHGI) over two periods (1980?1989, 2010?2019) in mid-eastern China. The DNDC model is driven by a county-scale database, consisting of meteorological data (79 stations), soil properties, management practice, and crop parameters for 213 counties. Eight scenarios were defined to isolate the individual and combined impacts of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices on yields, GWP, and GHGI. Results and conclusions: Results revealed that the total yield increased by 48.7% over the two periods but stagnated in the 2010s; the average emission rate of CH4 and N2O in the two periods were 250.7, 196, 0.63 and 2.83 kg ha- 1, respectively, while GWP and GHGI declined by 12.8% and 38.3%. The individual contributions of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices to the GHGI of the rice-winter wheat rotations were 37%, -42.5%, and 16.4%, respectively. Adoption of new cultivars was a decisive factor for improving yields and mitigating GHG, while climate change and management practices had a minor influence on yields. The negative responses of yield to improved management practices (i.e., high N fertilization, mid-season drainage) were mainly attributed to soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density variations and different fertilization patterns. The combination of new cultivars adoption and management practices decreased GHGI by 46.6%. These findings demonstrate the importance of high-yield crop varieties to low carbon agriculture, and that management practices should be adapted to local conditions and specific crop varieties. Significance: Given that the crop harvest index is approaching its theoretical upper limit and that promoting new varieties presents many challenges, future innovations should focus on introducing optimal strategies that balance the tradeoffs between yield and GHG emissions to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on agriculture.

Long term combined fertilization and soil aggregate size on the denitrification and community of denitrifiers. Balanced fertilization strategies that combine the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers have been adopted to increase soil fertility and crop yield and to safeguard environment. However, knowledge on the influence of these fertilization strategies on microbe-mediated nitrogen cycling in the agricultural ecosystems remains limited. We analyzed the denitrifiers with nitrite reductase genes (nirK and nirS) in three soil aggregate classes (large macroaggregates, > 2 mm; small macroaggregates, 0.25-2 mm; and microaggregates, < 0.25 mm) in response to long-term application of inorganic fertilizers (NPK), NPK plus straw (NPKS), and NPK plus manure (NPKM) in the fluvo-aquic soil of North China Plain. Both fertilization and aggregate size had significant effects on the nirK and nirS gene abundances and soil potential denitrification activity (PDA). PDA in the combined fertilizer-treated soils (NPKS and NPKM treatments) was two times more than that in inorganic NPK-treated soil. PDA dramatically increased in small macroaggregates and microaggregates of NPKS treatment. The nirS gene abundance was significantly higher than that of the nirK gene abundance, and NPKS and NPKM treatments increased the nirS to nirK ratio in bulk soils and in microaggregates compared with NPK treatment and control. Correlation analysis and automatic linear modeling revealed a primary correlation between PDA and abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers. Soil properties, such as SOC, pH and TN, significantly affected the community structure of nirK- and nirS-type denitrifiers while only aggregate size significantly influenced the composition of nirK-type denitrifiers. Taken together, our results suggest that long-term combined fertilization increased the denitrification potential in small macroaggregate and microaggregate classes, and the increased gene abundance and the shift community structures of nirS- and nirK-type denitrifiers were potentially responsible for an increase in the promoted denitrification.

Adding NBPT to urea increases N use efficiency of maize and decreases the abundance of N-cycling soil microbes under reduced fertilizer-N rate on the North China Plain. Urease inhibitor (UI) and nitrification inhibitor (NI) can reduce N losses from agricultural soils but effects of inhibitors on N cycle are unclear. A field experiment was conducted with maize to test effects of UI (N-(n-Butyl) thiophosphoric, NBPT) and NI (3,4-dimethylepyrazolephosphate, DMPP) on N uptake and N-cycling soil microbes. Five treatments were imposed: no N fertilizer input (CK), conventional fertilization (CF) and 80% of urea input with NBPT (80%U+UI), with DMPP (80%U+NI) and with half NBPT and half DMPP (80%U+1/2(UI+NI)). There were no significant differences in biomass between 80%U+UI, 80%U+NI and CF but harvest index was increased under 80%U+UI and 80%U+NI. Compared to CF, N use efficiency of grain under 80%U+UI was increased by 7.1%, whereas grain yield and N uptake under 80%U+1/2(UI+NI) were decreased by 8.2% and 9.4%, respectively. The peak soil NO3--N content was at about 15 days after fertilization (DAF) under CF but 30 DAF under the inhibitor treatments. In soils of 80%U+UI, the activities of urease and nitrate reductase were decreased between 15-45 DAF and between 5-30 DAF. The abundance of N-cycling soil microbes was affected: 80%U+UI and 80%U+NI reduced the copies of the amoA AOA and nir genes at about 15 days and reduced the copies of the amoA AOB gene at about 30 days. Correlation analysis indicated that there were significant positive relationships between amoA AOB gene and NH4+-N, as well as between nirK gene and NO3--N. Overall, urea applied with NBPT has greater potential for improving maize N use efficiency and inhibiting nitrification under reduced fertilizer-N applications.

Biochar and organic fertilizer changed the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea community structure of saline-alkali soil in the North China Plain. Purpose The application of a large amount of inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer resulted in an increasing N loss. It is an effective practice that biochar and organic fertilizer replace part of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer. Thus, it is necessary to identify and compare the effects of biochar and organic fertilizer on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) community structure in saline-alkali soil. Materials and methods Three treatments in triplicate were included in the field experiment: (1) CK (no biochar and organic fertilizer), (2) biochar at 10.0 t ha(-1) year(-1) (C), and (3) organic fertilizer at 7.5 t ha(-1) year(-1) (M). The community structures and diversities of AOB and AOA were investigated by Illumina sequencing analysis of gene encoding ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) and followed by principal component analysis, least discriminant analysis effect size, and redundancy analysis. Results and discussion Biochar and organic fertilizers did not change the diversity of AOA and reduced the relative abundance of Candidatus-Nitrosoarchaeum in maize season, while only biochar increased the relative abundance of Candidatus-Nitrosotenuis in wheat season. The diversity of AOB was significantly reduced in the M treatment, but was not changed in the C treatment in wheat season. Moreover, the relative abundances of Nitrosomonas (CK, 15.1%; C, 6.8%; M, 3.4%) were decreased in the maize season, and the relative abundances of Nitrosovibrio (CK, 9.8%; C, 16.8%; M, 14.5%) were increased in the wheat season in the C and M treatments, which probably related to the changes in soil pH, soil NH4+-N content, and soil salt content (SSC). The lower soil pH, higher NO3--N content, and SSC resulted in Nitrosospira (maize season: CK, 42.2%; C, 40.7%; M, 62.0%; wheat season: CK, 46.6%; C, 50.7%; M, 65.4%) becoming the dominant genus in the M treatment. Conclusions Our results indicated that AOB was more susceptible than AOA to biochar and organic fertilizer. Organic fertilizer has significant effects on the diversities and community structure of AOB than biochar associated with the changing in soil pH, salinity, and mineral N.

Optimizing tillage method and irrigation schedule for greenhouse gas mitigation, yield improvement, and water conservation in wheat?maize cropping systems. Excessive agricultural inputs meet food demand only at a huge environmental cost, and optimized management strategies are needed to promote the balanced development of food security, water conservation, and environ-mental sustainability. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment to investigate annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, yield, water use efficiency (WUE), global warming potential (GWP), and greenhouse gas in-tensity (GHGI) from 2016 to 2018 in a typical wheat?maize cropping system in the North China Plain. Two tillage methods (T1, rotary tillage; T2, subsoiling) and four irrigation schedules (W1, pre-planting irrigation; W2, pre-planting + jointing irrigation; W3, pre-planting + anthesis irrigation; W4, pre-planting + jointing + anthesis irrigation) were used for winter wheat, and conventional practices were adopted for summer maize. In the winter wheat?summer maize season, the soil acted as a net sink for CH4 but as a source for CO2 and N2O in all treat-ments, and CO2 accounted for the highest proportion of the GWP. The inappropriate irrigation period in the W3 treatment caused greater GHG release and reduced crop yield, whereas the excessive irrigation in the W4 treatment led to low water productivity. Although the use of irrigation water increased annual GHG emissions, an appropriate irrigation schedule could significantly mitigate the GHGI. Compared with the W3 and W4 treatments, the W2 treatment increased yield by an average of 7.56-10.58% and 2.06-2.68%, improved WUE by 9.95-17.83% and 11.29-22.84%, reduced GWP by 3.70?5.10% and 0.65-2.25%, and decreased GHGI by 10.66-14.26% and 3.05-4.86%, respectively. The T2 treatment resulted in high GHG emissions and was accompanied by low yield and water productivity. Relative to the T2 treatment, the annual yield and WUE in the T1 treatment increased by an average of 4.41-15.15% and 8.12-12.76%, and the annual GWP and GHGI decreased by 3.97-4.62% and 8.80-16.93%. Therefore, rotary tillage combined with supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage can mitigate GHG emissions and improve yield and water productivity, making it an envi-ronmentally friendly agricultural practice.

The Fate of Nitrogen During Agricultural Intensification in East Africa: Nitrogen Budgets in Contrasting Agroecosystems. The intensification of agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is necessary to reduce poverty and improve food security, but increased nutrient applications in smallholder systems could have negative consequences for water quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and air quality. We tracked nitrogen (N) inputs and measured maize (Zea mays) biomass, grain yields, N leaching, and nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide fluxes from a clayey soil in Yala, Kenya and a sandy soil in Tumbi, Tanzania, with application rates of 0, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) over two cropping seasons. Maize yields were 4.5 times higher in Yala than Tumbi, but yields plateaued at both sites with fertilizer applications at or above 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Partial N budgets in Yala were typically negative, meaning more N was exported in maize biomass plus grain or lost from the system than was added in fertilizer. In Tumbi, N budgets were negative at lower fertilizer levels but positive at higher fertilizer levels. At both sites most (96%) of the N was lost through maize biomass/grain removal and N leaching. Fertilizer additions at or less than 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) on these two contrasting sites resulted in minor gaseous N losses, and fertilizer additions less than 200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) caused relatively little change to N leaching losses. This indicates that the modest increases in fertilizer use required to improve maize yields will not greatly increase cropland N losses. C1 [Tully, K.

Dairy effluent mitigates N2O missions while extreme precipitation stimulates N2O losses in a sandy soil. Dairy effluents instead of mineral fertilizer can realize nutrients recycling while urease inhibitors have been proposed as fertilizer amendments to maximize nutrients utilization and reduce negative environmental effects. However, studies on the impacts of dairy effluent combined with urease inhibitors on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions remain limited. Here, a 2-year field trail with maize was conducted in a sandy soil with four treatments: no nitrogen (N) fertilizer (Control), mineral N fertilizer urea (NPK), fermented dairy effluent as liquid fertilizer (LF), and LF plus urease inhibitor hydroquinone (LFHQ). Cumulative N2O emission in the NPK treatment was 0.44 kg N ha-1 during the 2021 maize season while drastically increased to 5.21 kg N ha-1 during the 2022 maize season with extreme precipitation occurred, while NO emission reduced from 0.65 to 0.17 kg N ha-1. Compared with the NPK treatment, N2O and NO emissions in the LF treatment decreased by 38.6% and 29.2%, and by 38.8% and 6.4% during the 2021 and 2022 maize seasons, respectively. Compared with the LF treatment, the LFHQ treatment increased N2O emissions by 40.7% and 21.7% during the 2021 and 2022 maize seasons, respectively. The N2O emission factors (EF-N2O) of applied N was 0.90-1.71% during the 2022 maize season, which was ten times greater than the 2021 maize season. We further evaluated correlation between EF-N2O of mineral N fertilizer and annual precipitation in temperate sandy soils by compiling published literature, suggesting that there was a quadratic relationship between EF-N2O and precipitation, with the highest EF-N2O occurring at similar to 690 mm of precipitation. Accordingly, extreme precipitation would induce explosive N2O emissions at optimal scenario. Overall, our results suggest that replacing mineral fertilizers with dairy effluent mitigated N2O and NO emissions while heavy rainfall could cause N2O paroxysmal emission. Thus, rational water management in temperate farms is particularly required to avoid N2O surge emission after heavy rainfall events, and urease inhibitors co-application with nitrification inhibitors are recommended under dairy effluent application.

Soil Management, Irrigation and Fertilisation Strategies for N2O Emissions Mitigation in Mediterranean Agricultural Systems. Feeding a growing population, which will reach 10 billion in 2050, is a major challenge. Another major challenge is to increase crops' productivity in a sustainable way, as the increase in agricultural inputs may lead to greenhouse gas emissions, including N2O fertiliser. Several factors can influence N2O emissions such as irrigation, the soil management system, or the type of fertiliser used. The aim of this research is to study the impact of each above-mentioned factor on N2O emissions during three growing seasons in a maize field, considering three nitrogen fertilisers: urea (U), ammonium nitrate (AN), and a fertiliser with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP); two irrigation strategies: on demand (100%) and deficit irrigation (75% of demand); and a comparison of two soil management systems: conventional tillage (T) systems and no-tillage (NT) system. The interactions among the three factors and their effects on emissions were analysed through a principal component analysis. Higher emissions were recorded in plots that received the highest irrigation dose. The most favourable management to reduce N2O emissions derived from agricultural activity for maize crops under a Mediterranean climate was the NT soil management, using a fertiliser with nitrification inhibitor and an irrigation dose of 75% of conventional irrigation.

Effects of different forms of plant-derived organic matter on nitrous oxide emissions. To investigate the impact of different forms of plant-derived organic matter on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, an incubation experiment with the same rate of total nitrogen (N) application was carried out at 25 degrees C for 250 days. Soils were incorporated with maize-derived organic matter (i. e., maize residuederived dissolved organic matter and maize residues with different C/N ratios) and an inorganic N fertilizer (urea). The pattern and magnitude of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were affected by the form of N applied. Single application of maize-derived organic matter resulted in a higher N2O emission than single application of the inorganic N fertilizer or combined application of the inorganic N fertilizer and maize-derived organic matter. The positive effect of maize residue-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) addition on N2O emissions was relatively short-lived and mainly occurred at the early stage following DOM addition. In contrast, the positive effect induced by maize residue addition was more pronounced and lasted for a longer period. Single application of maize residues resulted in a substantial decrease in soil nitric nitrogen (NO3- -N), but it did not affect the production of N2O. No significant relationship between N2O emission and NO3--N and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) suggested that the availability of soil N was not limiting the production of N2O in our study. The key factors affecting soil N2O emission were the soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and metabolism quotient (qCO(2)). Both of them could explain 87% of the variation in cumulative N2O emission. The C/N ratio of maizederived organic matter was a poor predictor of N2O emission when the soil was not limited by easily available C and the available N content met the microbial N demands for nitrification and denitrification. The results suggested that the magnitude of N2O emission was determined by the impact of organic amendments on soil C availability and microbial activity rather than on soil N availability. In agricultural management practices, if the N inputs from organic and inorganic N fertilizers are equivalent, addition of organic N fertilizers that contain high amounts of available C will result in a higher N2O emission.

Effect of inhibitors and fertigation strategies on GHG emissions, NO fluxes and yield in irrigated maize. Abating large losses of nitrogen (N) oxides while maintaining or enhancing crop yield is a major goal in irrigated maize (Zea mays L) cropping areas. During two consecutive campaigns, the new nitrification inhibitor 2-(3,4-dimethy1-1H-pyrazol-1-y1) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA) applied with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and the same fertilizer applied by drip-fertigation without the inhibitor, were evaluated and compared with CAN broadcast to the surface and irrigated with sprinklers. Concurrently, urea-based treatments such as urea-fertigation and the broadcast application of urea combined with sprinkler irrigation, with or without the urease inhibitor N-butyl thiophosphorictriamide (NBPT), were also assessed. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes, grain and biomass yield and yield scaled N2O emissions of the different treatments were compared. Additionally, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured. On average, fertigation treatments led to a mitigation of N2O emissions with respect to sprinkler irrigation by 80% and 78% for CAN and urea, respectively. With regards to inhibitor-based strategies, the use of DMPSA and NBPT reduced N2O losses by 58% and 51%, respectively, considering the average of both maize cropping seasons. Since no differences in grain yield were observed between fertilized treatments, DMPSA and fertigation treatments gave the lowest values of yield-scaled N2O emissions, leading to reductions of 63%, 71% and 78% for CAN with DMPSA, urea-fertigation and CAN-fertigation, respectively, with respect to conventional management strategies (surface broadcast application and sprinkler irrigation). Low NO emissions during the first campaign masked differences between treatments, whereas during the second season, NO losses significantly decreased in the following order: conventional treatments > inhibitors > fertigation. Comparing conventional management practices, CAN significantly decreased emissions of N oxides compared with urea, but this effect was only observed in the second maize cropping season. The moisture distribution pattern in drip plots (dry and wet areas) caused a reduction of CH4 sink (only in one of the two seasons) and respiration fluxes, in comparison to sprinkler. This study shows that the use of the new nitrification inhibitor DMPSA and drip-fertigation should be promoted in irrigated maize agro-ecosystems, in order to mitigate emissions of N oxides without penalizing grain yield and leading to similar or enhanced biomass production.

Quantification of N-losses as NH3, NO, and N2O and N-2 from fertilized maize fields in southwestern France. Emissions of nitrogen compounds (NO, NH3, N2O and N-2) from heavily fertilized (280 kg(N) ha(-1)) and irrigated maize fields were studied over an annual cultivation cycle in southwestern France. NO and N2O emissions were measured by chamber techniques throughout the year. During fertilization and maize growth periods, chamber measurements were intensified and complemented by flux-gradient micrometeorological measurements of NOx and NH3. The two methods used, Bowen ratio and a simplified aerodynamical techniques, agree quite well and quantify NOx and NH3 flux variations during the period of intense emission which followed fertilizer application. Over a yearly cycle, nitrogen loss in the form of NH3, NO and N2O were calculated using micrometeorological flux measurements and emission algorithms calibrated with field data (chambers). The soil denitrification potential represented by the ratio N2O/(N2O+N-2) was measured in the laboratory to calculate potential total gaseous nitrogen loss. Taking into account all uncertainties, the total N loss into the atmosphere represents 30 to 110 kg(N) ha(-1) with about less than 1% as NH3, 40% as NO, 14% as N2O and 46% as N-2.

A new LandscapeDNDC biogeochemical module to predict CH4 and N2O emissions from lowland rice and upland cropping systems. Replacing paddy rice by upland systems such as maize cultivation is an on-going trend in SE Asia caused by increasing water scarcity and higher demand for meat. How such land management changes will feedback on soil C and N cycles and soil greenhouse gas emissions is not well understood at present. A new LandscapeDNDC biogeochemical module was developed that allows the effect of land management changes on soil C and N cycle to be simulated. The new module is applied in combination with further modules simulating microclimate and crop growth and evaluated against observations from field experiments. The model simulations agree well with observed dynamics of CH (4) emissions in paddy rice depending on changes in climatic conditions and agricultural management. Magnitude and peak emission periods of N (2) O from maize cultivation are simulated correctly, though there are still deficits in reproducing day-to-day dynamics. These shortcomings are most likely related to simulated soil hydrology and may only be resolved if LandscapeDNDC is coupled to more complex hydrological models. LandscapeDNDC allows for simulation of changing land management practices in SE Asia. The possibility to couple LandscapeDNDC to more complex hydrological models is a feature needed to better understand related effects on soil-atmosphere-hydrosphere interactions.

Effects of irrigation, fertilization and crop straw management on nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from a wheat-maize rotation field in northern China. One-year winter wheat-summer maize rotation is the most popular double cropping system in north-central China, and this highly productive system is an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions due to the high fertilizer N and irrigation water inputs. To sustain the high crop production and mitigate the detrimental impacts of N2O and NO emissions, improved management practices are extensively applied. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the effects of an improved management practice of irrigation, fertilization and crop straw on grain yield and N2O and NO emissions for a wheat-maize rotation field in northern China. Using automated and manual chamber measuring systems, we monitored N2O and NO fluxes for the conventional (CT, 2007-2008), improved (IT, 2007-2008), straw-amended (WS, 2008-2009), straw-not-amended (NS, 2008-2009), and no N-fertilizer treatments (WS-NN, 2008-2009), respectively, for one rotation-year. The grain yields were determined for CT and IT for three rotation-years (2005-2008) and for WS, NS and WS-NN for one rotation-year (2008-2009). The improved management of irrigation and fertilization reduced the annual N fertilization rate and irrigation amount by 17% and 30%, respectively; increased the maize yield by 7-14%; and significantly decreased the N2O and NO emissions by 7% (p < 0.05) and 29% (p < 0.01), respectively. The incorporation of wheat straw increased the cumulative N2O and NO emissions in the following maize season by 58% (p < 0.01) and 13%, respectively, whereas the effects of maize straw application were not remarkable. The N2O and NO emission factors of applied N were 2.32 +/- 2.32% and 0.42 +/- 1.69% for wheat straw and 0.67 +/- 0.23% and 0.54 +/- 0.15% for chemical N-fertilizers, respectively. Compared to conventional management practices using high application rates of irrigation water and chemical N-fertilizer as well as the field burning of crop straw, the improved management strategy presented here has obvious environmentally positive effects on grain yield and mitigation of N2O and NO emissions.

Reducing soil nitrogen losses from fertilizer use in global maize and wheat production. Maize and wheat are two major staple foods that collectively contribute two-thirds of the world's grain supply. The extensive use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers during the cultivation of both crops leads to significant losses of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into the environment. Here, using machine learning algorithms, we generate high-resolution maps of crop-specific soil Nr losses based on global field measurements. We estimate that global annual soil Nr losses from the use of synthetic N fertilizer in 2020, including direct emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), ammonia (NH3), N leaching and run-off, amount to 0.18, 1.62, 0.09, 1.47 and 1.10 million tonnes N for maize, and 0.12, 1.33, 0.07, 1.21 and 0.95 million tonnes N for wheat, respectively. The annual indirect N2O emissions induced by synthetic N fertilizer use from these soil Nr losses are estimated to be 45,000 and 37,000 tonnes for maize and wheat, respectively, with hydrologic pathways playing a predominant role. Enhancing N use efficiency up to 60% for regions below this value can achieve a total soil Nr loss mitigation potential of 4.00 million tonnes per year for the two crops, thereby reducing indirect N2O emissions by 49%. Our results contribute to constrain global N budgets from the use of fertilizer in agriculture, which then can help to improve projections of nitrogen cycle-climate feedbacks using modelling approaches.

Effects of Split Application of Urea on Greenhouse Gas and Ammonia Emissions From a Rainfed Maize Field in Northeast China. Split application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers during different crop growth stages to fulfill the crop N requirements reduces soil mineral N concentrations and improves the efficiency of crop N fertilizer use, and can decrease nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from the soil. However, inconsistent results regarding N2O emissions have been reported in rainfed areas. Furthermore, few long-term studies have explained the effects of split N application on soil methane (CH4) flux, thus limiting complete assessment of the effects of split N application on total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, long-term monitoring is urgently required to understand the impacts of split N application on GHG emissions in rainfed areas. In this study, a 6-year field experiment was conducted in a rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) field in Northeast China. The experiment included three treatments: no N application representing control (CK), single application at the sowing stage of maize (SU), and split N at the sowing and jointing stages at a ratio of 1: 2 (SF). Between the sowing and jointing stages, N2O emissions were significantly higher in SU than in SF. However, high N2O emissions were observed in SF for 1 month after N application at the jointing stage possibly because the time of N application coincided with optimum precipitation and soil temperature conditions, which stimulated N2O emissions. Overall, the total N2O emissions showed no significant difference between SU and SF. During the study period, split application of N fertilizer did not significantly affect the cumulative CH4 flux. Compared to CK, the yield-scaled GWP in SF treatment increased by 18.7% (p < 0.05). Ammonia (NH3) volatilization in SF was 272% higher than that in SU. The findings indicated that split N application exhibited an environmental risk by increasing the yield-scaled GWP and NH3 emissions in the field. Thus, this study suggested that single N application applied in the sowing stage should be employed in rainfed fields to mitigate the yield-scaled GWP and NH3 emissions, and maintain efficient maize yields.

Carbon Availability and Nitrogen Mineralization Control Denitrification Rates and Product Stoichiometry during Initial Maize Litter Decomposition. Returning crop residues to agricultural fields can accelerate nutrient turnover and increase N2O and NO emissions. Increased microbial respiration may lead to formation of local hotspots with anoxic or microoxic conditions promoting denitrification. To investigate the effect of litter quality on CO2, NO, N2O, and N-2 emissions, we conducted a laboratory incubation study in a controlled atmosphere (He/O-2, or pure He) with different maize litter types (Zea mays L., young leaves and roots, straw). We applied the N2O isotopocule mapping approach to distinguish between N2O emitting processes and partitioned the CO2 efflux into litter- and soil organic matter (SOM)-derived CO2 based on the natural C-13 isotope abundances. Maize litter increased total and SOM derived CO2 emissions leading to a positive priming effect. Although C turnover was high, NO and N2O fluxes were low under oxic conditions as high O-2 diffusivity limited denitrification. In the first week, nitrification contributed to NO emissions, which increased with increasing net N mineralization. Isotopocule mapping indicated that bacterial processes dominated N2O formation in litter-amended soil in the beginning of the incubation experiment with a subsequent shift towards fungal denitrification. With onset of anoxic incubation conditions after 47 days, N fluxes strongly increased, and heterotrophic bacterial denitrification became the main source of N2O. The N2O/(N2O+N-2) ratio decreased with increasing litter C:N ratio and C-org:NO3- ratio in soil, confirming that the ratio of available C:N is a major control of denitrification product stoichiometry.

A three-year measurement reveals that partial conversion from synthetic fertilizer to dairy manure increases cumulative nitric oxide emissions from a long-term experimental cropland. Conversion from synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer to organic manure has been well documented to effectively mitigate nitric oxide (NO) emissions in the current year or growing season. However, a clear understanding of NO emissions following long-term manure substitution is lacking. We hypothesize that soil conditions (particularly the accumulation of organic matter) following long-term manure substitution may stimulate NO emissions by providing more N substrates under favorable conditions. The primary aims of this study were to (1) quantify the long-term effects of manure substitution on NO emissions, and (2) identify the major regulating factors that contribute to the variations. Field measurements were conducted under summer maize-winter wheat rotations in a long-term fertilization experiment (since 1990) over three experimental years (from June 2016 to May 2019). The three treatments included an unfertilized control (CK), full synthetic urea in both crop seasons (NPK), and full synthetic urea in the maize season with 70% urea substituted by dairy manure in the winter wheat season (NPKM). Annual NO emissions varied from 0.10 to 0.22 kg N ha-1 and from 0.32 to 1.53 kg N ha-1 in CK and the fertilized treatments, respectively. We attributed the variations in annual NO emissions from the fertilized treatments to mean soil temperature by fitting a significant linear regression between the two variables (r2 = 0.681, p = 0.008). Seasonal NO emissions from NPKM treatment were lower (range, 2-66%, not always significant) and larger (range, 115-294%, not always significant) than those from NPK during the winter wheat and maize seasons, respectively. Annual NO emissions from NPKM treatment were 78% larger (range, 44-112%, not always significant) than those from NPK across the experimental years. Overall, this three-year field measurement revealed that cumulative NO emissions from NPKM treatment were significantly (p = 0.038) larger than those from NPK (2.73 versus 1.53 kg N ha-1). We concluded that long-term manure substitution for synthetic fertilizer in the winter wheat seasons did not mitigate, but rather stimulated cumulative NO emissions.

Effects of increasing fertilization rates on nitric oxide emission and nitrogen use efficiency in low carbon calcareous soil. Global nitrogen fertilizer consumption is expected to continue to increase. To explore effective mitigation strategies, a deeper understanding of the responses of nitrogen use efficiency, nitric oxide (NO) emission and the NO direct emission factor (EFd) to increasing fertilization rates is needed. A gradient of fertilization rates (0,135, 270, 430, 650 and 850 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the form of urea, hereafter referred to as NO, N135, N270, N430, N650 and N850, respectively) was used to fully represent the nitrogen application levels in the wheat-maize rotational cropping system that has been widely adopted in China. The annual NO emissions ranged from 0.43 +/- 0.04 (NO) to 2.64 +/- 0.35 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (N850) and linearly increased with increasing fertilization rates (P < 0.01). The high pH and low carbon availability in the calcareous soil limited NO production; thus, low EFd values (0.26-0.36%) were observed. The partial factor productivity of applied nitrogen (PFPN) rapidly decreased with increasing fertilization rates; the relationship could be characterized by a rectangular hyperbolic function (P < 0.01). The expected trade-off between EFd and PFPN was not observed. The on-farm PFPN was only 33 +/- 3 kg grain kg(-1) N (N430), highlighting the necessity of optimizing current management strategies. Based on a review of previous studies, a comprehensive optimized management strategy is recommended to obtain the maximum benefits for multiple goals of a wheat-maize cropping system. However, consecutive field observations and model studies are still needed to validate the long-term effects of this management strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Land use change effects on trace gas fluxes in the forest margins of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Land use changes and land use intensification are considered important processes contributing to the increasing concentrations of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) and of nitric oxide (NO), a precursor of ozone. Studies on the effects of land use changes and land use intensification on soil trace gas emissions were mostly conducted in Latin America and only very few in Asia. Here we present results from Central Sulawesi where profound changes in land use and cultivation practices take place: traditional agricultural practices like shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn agriculture are replaced by permanent cultivation systems and introduction of income-generating cash crops like cacao. Our results showed that N2O emissions were higher from cacao agroforestry (35 +/- 10 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) than maize (9 +/- 2 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)), whereas intermediate rates were observed from secondary forests (25 +/- 11 mg N m(-2) h(-1)). NO emissions did not differ among land use systems, ranging from 12 +/- 2 mg N m(-2) h(-1) for cacao agroforestry and secondary forest to 18 +/- 2 mg N m(-2) h(-1) for maize. CH4 uptake was higher for maize (-30 +/- 4 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) than cacao agroforestry (-18 +/- 2 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) and intermediate rates were measured from secondary forests (-25 +/- 4 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)). Combining these data with results from other studies in this area, we present chronosequence effects of land use change on trace gas emissions from natural forest, through maize cultivation, to cacao agroforestry (with or without fertilizer). Compared to the original forests, this typical land use change in the study area clearly led to higher N2O emissions and lower CH4 uptake with age of cacao agroforestry systems. We conclude that this common land use sequence in the area combined with the increasing use of fertilizer will strongly increase soil trace gas emissions. We suggest that the future hot spot regions of high N2O (and to a lesser extend NO) emissions in the tropics are those areas where climatic and edaphic conditions allow for intensive agriculture. This scenario is probably preferable over the alternative of agriculture extensification, which would imply a dramatic increase in deforestation rates with accompanying CO2 emissions.

Effect of organic amendments on yield-scaled N2O emissions from winter wheat-summer maize cropping systems in Northwest China. The effect of dairy manure amendments to agricultural soil on the yield-scaled nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remains unclear. We hypothesize that an optimum ratio of dairy manure to synthetic fertilizers leads to large nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and small yield-scaled N2O emissions. The aims of this study were to (1) quantify the variations in the crop yields and N2O emissions from winter wheat-summer maize cropping systems in Northwest China, (2) determine the responses of the NUE and yield-scaled N2O emission to the ratio of organic materials to synthetic fertilizers, and (3) evaluate the relationship between the NUE and yield-scaled N2O emissions. Field measurements were conducted within long- and short-term fertilization experiments between the years of 2014 and 2016. Treatments included synthetic fertilizers, synthetic fertilizers plus crop residues, and synthetic fertilizers plus dairy manure at both sites. The annual grain yields and N2O emissions varied from 13.3 to 18.0 Mg ha(-1) and from 1.3 to 3.6 kg N ha(-1), respectively, across the treatments. The yield-scaled N2O emissions related negatively to the NUE, suggesting that agronomic aims of improving NUE are an effective approach to mitigate N2O emissions. The ratio of organic materials to synthetic fertilizers was not a significant limit on the NUE and yield-scaled N2O emissions. We conclude that organic amendments appeared to play a minor influence on the promotion of the NUE and N2O mitigation.

Assessing biogeochemical effects and best management practice for a wheat-maize cropping system using the DNDC model. Contemporary agriculture is shifting from a single-goal to a multi-goal strategy, which in turn requires choosing best management practice (BMP) based on an assessment of the biogeochemical effects of management alternatives. The bottleneck is the capacity of predicting the simultaneous effects of different management practice scenarios on multiple goals and choosing BMP among scenarios. The denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model may provide an opportunity to solve this problem. We validated the DNDC model (version 95) using the observations of soil moisture and temperature, crop yields, aboveground biomass and fluxes of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) from a wheat-maize cropping site in northern China. The model performed well for these variables. Then we used this model to simulate the effects of management practices on the goal variables of crop yields, NO emission, nitrate leaching, NH3 volatilization and net emission of greenhouse gases in the ecosystem (NEGE). Results showed that no-till and straw-incorporated practices had beneficial effects on crop yields and NEGE. Use of nitrification inhibitors decreased nitrate leaching and N2O and NO emissions, but they significantly increased NH3 volatilization. Irrigation based on crop demand significantly increased crop yield and decreased nitrate leaching and NH3 volatilization. Crop yields were hardly decreased if nitrogen dose was reduced by 15% or irrigation water amount was reduced by 25 %. Two methods were used to identify BMP and resulted in the same BMP, which adopted the current crop cultivar, field operation schedules and full straw incorporation and applied nitrogen and irrigation water at 15 and 25% lower rates, respectively, than the current use. Our study indicates that the DNDC model can be used as a tool to assess biogeochemical effects of management alternatives and identify BMP.

Using field-measured soil N2O fluxes and laboratory scale parameterization of N2O/(N2O+N2) ratios to quantify field-scale soil N2 emissions. Soil dinitrogen (N-2) emissions are a key nitrogen loss pathway of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the quantification of field N-2 emissions from terrestrial ecosystems remains challenging, as sensitive field methods for measuring N-2 fluxes are lacking. Here, we report a new approach to quantify field N-2 emissions by (i) param-eterizing the molar ratio of nitrous oxide (N2O) to N2O plus N-2 emissions (RN2O) in the laboratory and (ii) measuring field N2O emissions and soil factors. Soil samples were taken from a maize field and incubated in the laboratory under simulated field conditions. Soil N-2 and N2O emissions were determined using the gas-flow-soilcore method. The measurements revealed that the RN2O values were significantly higher (0.06-0.67) following urea fertilization and soil rewetting compared to those periods with no fertilization (0.03-0.08) (P < 0.01). A multivariate, nonlinear parameterization of RN z o against four easily measured soil factors (ammonia and nitrate concentrations, temperature, and moisture) (n = 20, r(2) = 0.92, P < 0.001) was developed. The seasonal N-2 emissions at the field scale were calculated by combining the laboratory-measured RN2O with the field-measured N2O emissions and the soil factors. Based on this approach, the cumulative emissions of N-2 and N-2 +N2O for the maize season were 7.2 +/- 2.8 and 9.6 +/- 2.1 (standard error) kg N ha(-1), respectively. Using a fixed RN2O, i.e., disregarding the temporal and spatial variability of RN2O, resulted in approximately 50%-70% lower estimates. Our study shows that a combination of field N2O and soil factors measurements and laboratory parameterization of RN2O allows field N-2 emissions from croplands to be constrained. With additional measurements, including other soil properties, the development of a generalized parameterization of RN2O may become feasible. This approach would allow for a better understanding of gaseous N losses from agricultural ecosystems.

Mitigating nitrous oxide emissions from a maize-cropping black soil in northeast China by a combination of reducing chemical N fertilizer application and applying manure in autumn. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils, mainly caused by chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs, are major sources of N2O in Chinese terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, attempts to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils by optimizing N applications are receiving increasing attention. Further, organic fertilizers are being increasingly used in China to improve crop production/quality and prevent or reduce soil degradation. However, organic and chemical fertilizers are often both applied in spring in northeast China, which promotes N2O emissions and may be sub-optimal. Therefore, we hypothesized that reducing applications of chemical fertilizer N and applying manure in autumn could be an effective strategy for mitigating N2O emissions from cropped soils in the region. To test this hypothesis, we established a field trial to investigate the effects of different combinations of chemical N fertilizer applications and animal manure in autumn on both N2O emissions and maize (Zea mays L.) grain yields in northeast China. The treatments, expressed as NxMy (where Nx and My denote the total amounts of chemical fertilizer nitrogen (N) and manure (M) applied in kg N ha(-1) and m(3)Mha(-1), respectively), were N0M0, N230M0, N270M12, N230M15, N320M18 in 2010 and N0M0, N230M0, N200M12, N200M15, N280M18 in 2011. Measurements of the resulting N2O emissions showed that pulse fluxes occurred after each chemical N fertilizer application, but not after manure inputs in autumn or during soil-thawing periods in the following spring. Emission factors for the chemical fertilizer N were on average 1.07% (1.001.10%) and 1.14% (0.491.83%) in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Furthermore, by comparing the nine pairs of fertilization treatments, the relative increase in cumulative nitrous oxide-nitrogen (N2O-N) emissions was found to be proportional to the relative increase in urea application, but independent of the amount of autumn-applied manure. These findings imply that N2O emissions from fertilized agricultural soils in northeast China could be mitigated by supplying manure in the autumn and reducing the total amount of chemical N fertilizer applied in the following year. Although no significant difference in maize grain yield was found among the fertilization treatments, the grain yield-scaled N2O emissions for the treatments with a lower chemical N application (e.g., N230M15 and N200M15 treatments) were significantly lower than those with a higher chemical N application (e.g., N320M18 and N280M18 treatments). Meanwhile, under the condition of the same application amount of chemical fertilizer N, the grain yield-scaled N2O emission decreased with the increase of manure application rate. Thus, the results support the hypothesis that combining reductions in chemical N fertilizer and applying manure in autumn could be an effective strategy for mitigating N2O emissions from N-fertilized soils in northeast China.

N2O fluxes in soils of contrasting textures fertilized with liquid and solid dairy cattle manures. Manure is known to increase soil N2O emissions by stimulating nitrification and denitrification processes. Our objective was to compare soil-surface N2O emissions following the application of liquid and solid dairy cattle manures to a loamy and a clay soil cropped to silage maize. Manures were applied in 2 consecutive years at rates equivalent to 150 kg total N ha(-1) and compared with a control treatment receiving an equivalent rate of synthetic N. Soil-surface N2O fluxes, soil temperature, and soil water, nitrate and ammonium contents were monitored weekly in manured and control plots. From 60 to 90% of seasonal N2O emissions occurred during the first 40 d following manure and synthetic fertilizer applications, indicating that outside that period one or several factors limited N2O emissions. The period of higher emissions following manure and fertilizer application corresponded with the period when soil mineral N contents were highest (up to 17 g NO3- -N m(-2)) and water-filled pore space (WFPS) was greater than 0.5 m(3) m(-3). The absence of significant N2O fluxes later in the growing season despite high WFPS levels indicated that the stimulating effect of organic and synthetic N additions on soil N2O production was relatively short-lived. Fertilization of silage maize with dairy cattle manure resulted in greater or equal N2O emissions than with synthetic N. This was observed despite lower overall soil mineral N contents in the manured plots, indicating that other factors affected by manure, possibly additional C substrates and enhanced soil respiration, resulted in greater denitrification and N2O production. Silage maize yields in the manured soils were lower than those receiving synthetic N, indicating that the N(2)Oemissions per kilogram of harvested biomass were greater for manures than for synthetic N. Our results also suggest that the main source of N2O was nitrification in the loam and denitrification in the clay soil. There was no clear difference in N2O emissions between liquid and solid manures. The variable effects of liquid and solid manure addition on soil N(2)Oemissions reported in the literature likely result from the variable composition of the manures themselves as well as from interactions with other factors such as soil environment and farming practices. A better characterization of the availability of manure C and N is required to assess the impact of manure application on soil N2O emissions under field conditions.

Management of pig manure to mitigate NO and yield-scaled N2O emissions in an irrigated Mediterranean crop. Substitution of conventional mineral fertilizers with organic sources can avoid the environmental problems associated with high concentrations of intensive livestock production in some Mediterranean areas. Some management practices, such as the use of nitrification inhibitors or more efficient irrigation techniques (e.g., drip irrigation), have been suggested as effective alternatives to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions released from soils amended with synthetic and organic fertilizers. In this experiment, we aimed to assess the effect of different organic amendments derived from pig manure (control without N fertilization (C); liquid fraction of pig slurry (LFPS); pig urine with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4 dimethylpyrazolephosphate (DMPP) (LFPSI); compost from the solid phase of pig slurry (COM)) compared to urea (U) and two different irrigation systems (the widespread sprinkler and alternative drip irrigation systems) on greenhouse gas (N2O, methane, CH4, and carbon dioxide, CO2) and NO emissions in a maize (Zea mays L.) crop. The effect of these treatments on crop yields and yield scaled N2O emissions were also evaluated. The use of DMPP with LFPS was an effective practice to reduce N2O and NO losses (40 and 32% mitigation, respectively, compared to LFPS alone), and was also associated with the highest rates of CH4 oxidation. Drip irrigation significantly reduced the global warming potential (in spite of a lower CH4 sink) but increased the NO losses by 58%, as opposed td sprinkler irrigation. The higher biomass production and similar grain yields observed with drip irrigatioh resulted in lower yield scaled N2O emissions in this treatment than in sprinkler irrigation. The use of organic fertilizers penalized grain yields compared to U (16-33%), although the differences were not significant in the case of LFPSI. Consequently, LFPSI in drip irrigation was (together with U applied by drip-fertigation) the treatment that led to the lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions. The use of organic N sources in irrigated maize is an environmentally advisable strategy in Mediterranean cropping systems, but an optimum balance between N oxides and greenhouse gas losses, N efficiency and crop yields requires the use of nitrification inhibitors (e.g., DMPP) with liquid organic sources.

Nonlinear response of nitric oxide fluxes to fertilizer inputs and the impacts of agricultural intensification on tropospheric ozone pollution in Kenya. Crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa remain stagnant at 1 ton ha(-1), and 260 million people lack access to adequate food resources. Order-of-magnitude increases in fertilizer use are seen as a critical step in attaining food security. This increase represents an unprecedented input of nitrogen (N) to African ecosystems and will likely be accompanied by increased soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO). NO is a precursor to tropospheric ozone, an air pollutant and greenhouse gas. Emissions of NO from soils occur primarily during denitrification and nitrification, and N input rates are a key determinant of emission rates. We established experimental maize plots in western Kenya to allow us to quantify the response function relating NO flux to N input rate during the main 2011 and 2012 growing seasons. NO emissions followed a sigmoid response to fertilizer inputs and have emission factors under 1% for the roughly two-month measurement period in each year, although linear and step relationships could not be excluded in 2011. At fertilization rates above 100 kg N ha(-1), NO emissions increased without a concomitant increase in yields. We used the GEOS-CHEM chemical transport model to evaluate local impacts of increased NO emissions on tropospheric ozone concentrations. Mean 4-hour afternoon tropospheric ozone concentrations in Western Kenya increased by up to roughly 2.63 ppbv under fertilization rates of 150 kg N ha(-1) or higher. Using AOT40, a metric for assessing crop damage from ozone, we find that the increased ozone concentrations result in an increase in AOT40 exposure of approximately 110 ppbh for inputs of 150 kg N ha(-1) during the March-April-May crop growing season, compared with unfertilized simulations, with negligible impacts on crop productivity. Our results suggest that it may be possible to manage Kenyan agricultural systems for high yields while avoiding substantial impacts on air quality.

Responses of N2O and CH4 fluxes to fertilizer nitrogen addition rates in an irrigated wheat-maize cropping system in northern China. Model and field studies generally posit that when the application rates of nitrogen fertilizer exceed crop needs, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions will increase nonlinearly, though linear responses are also extensively reported by field studies. We conducted year-round measurements of crop yield, N2O and methane (CH4) fluxes for treatments of six fertilizer nitrogen levels (0, 135, 270, 430, 650 and 850 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the form of urea) in a typical irrigated wheat-maize rotation field in northern China. Linear models characterized the responses of cumulative N2O emissions to fertilizer rates well; therefore, the calculated N2O emission factors of 0.17 +/- 0.02%, 0.73 +/- 0.05% and 0.49 +/- 0.02% for the wheat season, maize season and annual scale, respectively, were appropriate for the different fertilizer rates. The cumulative CH4 uptake by the soil tended to be enhanced at higher fertilizer rates (>= 350 kg N ha(-1)) in the maize season whereas no effect was observed for the wheat season. When the annual fertilizer rates increased from 270 to 430, from 270 to 650, and from 270 to 850 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), the crop yields increased only 3 similar to 15% (0.5 similar to 2.1 t ha(-1) yr(-1)), but cumulative N2O emissions increased 35 similar to 115% (0.9 similar to 3.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). We recommend 270 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as the locally optimum fertilizer rate. Considering the nitrogen inputs by fertilization (270 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), irrigation (4.3 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and deposition (wet deposition: 30.5 +/- 1.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), the slightly positive soil nitrogen balance could maintain the current crop yield (similar to 13.8 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) and reduce the present high N2O emissions (>3.51 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) of the local farmers' practice (fertilizer rate > 430 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)).

Topography Controls N2O Emissions Differently during Early and Late Corn Growing Season. Topography affects soil hydrological, pedological, and biochemical processes and may influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions into the atmosphere. While N2O emissions from agricultural fields are mainly measured at plot scale and on flat topography, intrafield topographical and crop growth variability alter soil processes and might impact N2O emissions. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of topographical variations on crop growth period dependent soil N2O emissions at the field scale. A field experiment was conducted at two agricultural farms (Baggs farm; BF and Research North; RN) with undulating topography. Dominant slope positions (upper, middle, lower and toeslope) were identified based on elevation difference. Soil and gas samples were collected from four replicated locations within each slope position over the whole corn growing season (May-October 2019) to measure soil physio-chemical properties and N2O emissions. The N2O emissions at BF ranged from -0.27 +/- 0.42 to 255 +/- 105 g ha(-1) d(-1). Higher cumulative emissions were observed from the upper slope (1040 +/- 487 g ha(-1)) during early growing season and from the toeslope (371 +/- 157 g ha(-1)) during the late growing season with limited variations during the mid growing season. Similarly, at RN farm, (emissions ranged from -0.50 +/- 0.83 to 70 +/- 15 g ha(-1) d(-1)), the upper slope had higher cumulative emissions during early (576 +/- 132 g ha(-1)) and mid (271 +/- 51 g ha(-1)) growing season, whereas no impact of slope positions was observed during late growing season. Topography controlled soil and environmental properties differently at different crop growth periods; thus, intrafield variability must be considered in estimating N2O emissions and emission factor calculation from agricultural fields. However, due to large spatial variations in N2O emissions, further explorations into site-specific analysis of individual soil properties and their impact on N2O emissions using multiyear data might help to understand and identify hotspots of N2O emissions.

A national inventory of fertilizer N-induced gaseous Nr emissions from croplands in China remains to be developed to reveal its role in shaping climate change. Here we present a data-driven estimate of fertilizer N-induced soil Nr emissions based on regional and crop-specific emission factors (EFs) compiled from 379 manipulative studies. In China, agricultural soil Nr emissions from the use of synthetic N fertilizer and manure in 2018 are estimated to be 3.81 and 0.73 Tg N yr(-1), with a combined contribution of 23%, 20% and 15% to the global agricultural emission total of ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), respectively. Over the past three decades, NH3 volatilization from croplands has experienced a shift from a rapid increase to a decline trend, whereas N2O and NO emissions always maintain a strong growth momentum due to a robust and continuous rise of EFs. Regionally, croplands in Central south (1.51 Tg N yr(-1)) and East (0.99 Tg N yr(-1)) of China exhibit as hotspots of soil Nr emissions. In terms of crop-specific emissions, rice, maize and vegetable show as three leading Nr emitters, together accounting for 61% of synthetic N fertilizer-induced Nr emissions from croplands. The global warming effect derived from cropland N2O emissions in China was found to dominate over the local cooling effects of NH3 and NO emissions. Our established regional and crop-specific EFs for gaseous Nr forms provide a new benchmark for constraining the IPCC Tier 1 default EF values. The spatio-temporal insight into soil Nr emission data from N fertilizer application in our estimate is expected to advance our efforts towards more accurate global or regional cropland Nr emission inventories and effective mitigation strategies.

Abundance, diversity and functional gene expression of denitrifier communities in adjacent riparian and agricultural zones. Lands under riparian and agricultural management differ in soil properties, water content, plant species and nutrient content and are therefore expected to influence denitrifier communities, denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Denitrifier community abundance, denitrifier community structure, denitrification gene expression and activity were quantified on three dates in a maize field and adjacent riparian zone. N2O emissions were greater in the agricultural zone, whereas complete denitrification to N-2 was greater in the riparian zone. In general, the targeted denitrifier community abundance did not change between agricultural and riparian zones. However, nosZ gene expression was greater in the riparian zone than the agricultural zone. The community structure of nirS-gene-bearing denitrifiers differed in June only, whereas the nirK-gene-bearing community structure differed significantly between the riparian and the agricultural zones at all dates. The nirK-gene-bearing community structure was correlated with soil pH, while no significant correlations were found between nirS-gene-bearing community structure and soil environmental variables or N2O emissions, denitrification or denitrifier enzyme activity. The results suggested for the nirK and nirS-gene-bearing communities different factors control abundance vs. community structure. The nirK-gene-bearing community structure was also more responsive than the nirS-gene-bearing community structure to change between the two ecosystems.

Fate of 15N-labelled ammonium nitrate with or without the new nitrification inhibitor DMPSA in an irrigated maize crop. Nitrification inhibitors, originally proposed for nitrate leaching mitigation, are recommended as effective nitrous oxide (N2O) mitigation strategies. Several compounds have been trialled and used in the past including dicyandiamide (DCD) or 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Yet, little is known about the new nitrification inhibitor 2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA). A field experiment using N-15 single-labelled ammonium nitrate ((NH4NO3)-N-15 or (NH4NO3)-N-15) was conducted to understand the effectiveness of DMPSA on a biochemical basis in an irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) crop. Gaseous fluxes, i.e. N2O, (N2O)-N-15, N-15(2), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) were measured, as well as soil mineral N, yield components and N-15 recovery in plant and soil. During the maize cropping period, the use of DMPSA significantly reduced cumulative N2O emissions (118 g N ha(-1)) compared to ammonium nitrate without inhibitor (231 g N ha(-1)). The N-15 analyses revealed that most N2O losses (particularly during the emission peak) came from (NH4NO3)-N-15 (i.e. nitrification, nitrifier denitrification and/or coupled nitrification denitrification) rather than (NH4NO3)-N-15 in this calcareous low C-content soil. As expected, DMPSA decreased N2O losses from (NH4+)-N-15 oxidation, but an effect on non-target microorganisms was noticed, as shown by the significant reduction of respiration rates and N2O losses coming from (NO3-)-N-15. No significant effect of DMPSA on CH4 oxidation or N-15(2) fluxes was observed. The DMPSA did not lead to a significant improvement of the dry weights of grain or biomass, although an increment of root biomass by 64% was found. This compound also tended to increase plant N recovery (average 67.8%) and to decrease soil N recovery (average 18.3%) but differences were not statistically significant. Conversely, the nitrification inhibitor significantly reduced the residual fertilizer-N in the 15-30 cm and 30-45 cm soil layers. The use of DMPSA was confirmed as a highly effective tool to reduce N2O emissions from irrigated crops in semi-arid areas.

Gaseous emissions of N2O and NO and NO3- leaching from urea applied with urease and nitrification inhibitors to a maize (Zea mays) crop. Urea has become the predominant source of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer used throughout the world. Among the various available mitigation tools, urease inhibitors like NBPT have the most potential to improve efficiency of urea by reducing N losses, mainly via ammonia volatilization. However, there is a lack of information on the effect of N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBFT) on other N losses such as gaseous emissions of N2O and NO and NO3- leaching. A two-year field experiment using irrigated maize (Zea mays) crop was carried out under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effectiveness of urea coated with NBPT (0.4%, w/w) alone and with both NBPT and nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) (0.4 and 3%, w/w, respectively) to mitigate N2O-N, NO-N and NO3--N losses. The different treatments of U, U+NBPT and U+NBPT+DCD were applied to the maize crop in 2009 and then in 2010. The 2010 maize crop followed a fallow period, during which the 2009 crop residues were incorporated into the soil. Two different irrigation regimes were followed each year. In 2009, irrigation was controlled for the first 2 weeks following urea fertilization; whereas, the 2010 crop period was characterized by increased irrigation in the same period. After each treatment application, measurements of the changes in soil mineral N, gaseous emissions of N2O and NO, nitrate leaching and biomass production were made. N2O emissions were effectively abated by NBPT and NBPT+DCD and were reduced by 54 and 24%, respectively, in 2009. A reduction in nitrification rate by the inhibitors was also observed during 2009. In 2010 cropping period, NBPT reduced N2O emissions by 4%; while the combination of NBPT and DCD treatment reduced N2O emission by 43%. Yield-scaled N2O emissions were reduced by 50 and 18% by NBPT and the mixture of NBPT+DCD, respectively, in 2009. Applying inhibitors did not have any significant effect on yieldscaled N2O emissions in the 2010 crop period. Total NO losses from urea were 2.25 kg NO-N ha(-1) in the 2009 crop period and 5 times lower in the following year; this may provide an indicator of the prevalence of nitrification as the main process in the production of N2O in the 2009 maize crop. Most of the NO3- was lost within the fallow period (i.e. 92,81 and 75% of the total NO3- leached for U, U+NBPT and U+NBPT+DCD, respectively), so the incorporation of crop residues was not as effective as expected at reducing these N losses. Our study suggests that the effectiveness of NBFT and combination of NBPT+DCD in reducing N losses from applied urea is influenced by management practices, such as irrigation, and climatic conditions.

Estimations of emission factors for fertilizer-induced direct N2O emissions from agricultural soils in Japan:: Summary of available data. Agricultural fields are significant sources of anthropogenic atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). We compiled and analyzed data on N2O emissions from Japanese agricultural fields (246 measurements from 36 sites) reported in peer-reviewed journals and research reports. Agricultural fields were classified into three categories: upland fields, tea fields and rice paddy fields. In this analysis, data measured over a period of more than 90 days for upland fields and 209 days for tea fields were used to estimate annual fertilizer-induced emission factors (EF) because of limitations in the available data. The EF is defined as the emission from fertilized plots minus the background emission (emission from a zero-N control plot), and is expressed as a percentage of the N applied. The mean of N2O emissions from upland fields with well-drained soils was significantly lower than that from poorly drained soils. Mean (+/- standard deviation) N2O emissions measured over a period of more than 90 days from fertilized upland fields were 1.03 +/- 1.14 kg N ha(-1) and 4.78 +/- 5.36 kg N ha(-1) for well-drained and poorly drained soils, respectively. Because the ratio of the total areas of well-drained soils and poorly drained soils was different from the ratio of the number of available EF data for each soil category, we used a weighted mean to estimate EF for all upland fields. The EF was estimated to be 0.62 +/- 0.48% for all fertilized upland fields. Mean N2O emissions and the estimated EF for fertilized tea fields measured over a period of more than 209 days were 24.3 +/- 16.3 kg N ha(-1) and 2.82 +/- 1.80%, respectively. The mean N2O emission and estimated EF from Japanese rice paddy fields were 0.36 kg N ha(-1) and 0.31 +/- 0.31% for the cropping season, respectively. Significant uncertainties remain in these results because of limitations in the available data. C1 Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan.

Crop straw incorporation interacts with N fertilizer on N2O emissions in an intensively cropped farmland. Nitrogen (N) fertilization and straw incorporation strongly influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural fields. An in-situ micro-plot experiment on intensively farmed winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted to investigate the source and rate of N2O emissions from soils following labeled N-15 fertilization with and without straw incorporation. Four treatments, i.e., no N fertilizer and no straw incorporation (N0S0), straw incorporation only (N0S1), N fertilizer only (N1S0), and N fertilization plus straw incorporation (N1S1), were established in the experiment. The N2O emissions mainly occurred after N fertilization and lasted for approximately 1-2 weeks, accounting for 60%-67% of the wheat seasonal N2O emissions. Within the 6 days after basal fertilization and 2-4 days after top-dressing, most of the N2O fluxes (> 50%) were derived from fertilizer. Thereafter, soil-derived N2O dominated the total N2O emissions and within 10-20 days after N fertilization, fertilizer-derived N2O became negligible. Fertilizer N and soil N both accounted for 40%-60% of the seasonal N2O emissions, which may be explained by the high soil N stock due to long-term high N fertilization in the region. This implies the similar roles of soil N pool and fertilizer N in N2O generation under intensively farmed soils. The N fertilization had a significant priming effect on the turnover of soil N, which contributed 21.02%-50.47% of the total N2O emissions. During the basal fertilization/first irrigation event, straw incorporation significantly (P < 0.05) stimulated CO2 fluxes both in N-fertilized and non-N-fertilized plots; however, after the top-dressing/second irrigation event, the significant increase of CO2 fluxes induced by straw incorporation was only observed in the N-fertilized treatment. Straw incorporation interacted with N fertilization, and tended to enhance N2O emissions in the basal fertilization and lower N2O emissions in the top-dressing period. In N-fertilized plots, the seasonal N2O emissions from straw-incorporated and straw-removed treatments were similar, indicating that straw incorporation enhanced the N supply without increasing the N2O emissions. Our study highlights that there are significant benefits of straw incorporation to soil fertility improvement; however, the long-term impacts of straw incorporation on greenhouse gas emissions should be further examined.

Enhanced-Efficiency Fertilizer Impacts on Yield-Scaled Nitrous Oxide Emissions in Maize. Balancing efforts to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from crop production while increasing grain yields is an important challenge for agriculture. The objectives of this study were to assess N2O emissions, soil inorganic nitrogen (N) concentrations, grain yield, and grain N content for three enhanced-efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs) compared with anhydrous ammonia in a rainfed corn system in Illinois over 3 yr (2015-2017). Treatments included a control (check) and four N sources applied at 202 kg N ha(-1): injected anhydrous ammonia, stabilized urea containing urease and nitrification inhibitors (SuperU, Agrotain International), polymer-coated urea (ESN, Agrium Advanced Technologies), and injected urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) + nitrapyrin. Significant reductions in N2O emissions were observed for several EENFs compared with anhydrous ammonia, but results were not consistent across treatments and years. SuperU reduced area-and yield-scaled N2O emissions in two of three study years compared with anhydrous ammonia, while ESN had no N2O mitigation benefit. Injected UAN + nitrapyrin had the highest emissions in the first year but significantly decreased emissions in the second 2 yr. No treatment significantly improved yield or grain N content compared with anhydrous ammonia. In light of efforts to broadly promote EENFs in the US Midwest, these results demonstrate there is some promise for N2O mitigation, but the lack of clear crop productivity benefits combined with inconsistent N2O mitigation effects do not support the conclusion that EENFs inherently improve agronomic and environmental outcomes.

Mineral N dynamics, leaching and nitrous oxide losses under maize following two-year improved fallows on a sandy loam soil in Zimbabwe. The fate of the added N on a sandy loam soil was determined in an improved fallow-maize sequence field experiment in Zimbabwe. Pre-season mineral N was determined in 20 cm sections to 120 cm depth by soil auguring in seven land use systems. Thereafter, sequential soil auguring was done at two-week intervals in plots that previously had 2-year fallows of Acacia angustissima, Sesbania sesban and unfertilized maize to determine mineral N dynamics. Using the static chamber technique, N(2)O fluxes were also determined in the same plots. Pre-season NH(4)-N concentrations were > 12 kg N ha(-1) in the 0-20 cm layer for treatments that had a pronounced litter layer. NO(3)-N concentrations below 60 cm depth were <3 kg N ha(-1) layer(-1) for Sesban, Acacia, Cajanus cajan and natural woodland compared with > 10 kg N ha(-1) layer(-1) in the control plots where maize had been cultivated each year. There was a flush of NO3-N in the Sesbania and Acacia plots with the first rains. Topsoil NO3-N had increased to > 29 kg N ha(-1) by the time of establishing the maize crop. This increase in NO3-N in the topsoil was not sustained as concentrations decreased rapidly within three weeks of maize planting, to amounts of 8.6 kg N ha(-1) and 11.2 kg N ha(-1) for the Sesbania and Acacia plots, respectively. Total NO3-N leaching losses from the 0-40 cm layer ranged from 29-40 kg ha(-1) for Sesbania and Acacia plots within two weeks when 104 mm rainfall was received to an already fully recharged soil profile. Nitrate then accumulated below the 40 cm depth during early season when the maize had not developed a sufficient root length density to effectively capture nutrients. At one week after planting maize, N(2)O fluxes of 12.3 g N(2)O-N ha(-1) day(-1) from Sesbania plots were about twice as high as those from Acacia, and about seven times the 1.6 g N(2)O-N ha(-1) day(-1) from maize monoculture. This was at the time when mineral N was at its peak in the topsoil. The unfertilized maize showed consistently low N(2)O emissions, which never exceeded 2 g N(2)O-N ha(-1) day(-1) for all the eight sampling dates. The decrease of mineral N concentration in the topsoil resulted in reduced N(2)O fluxes, despite very high soil moisture conditions. Total N(2)O-N emissions were greatest for Sesbania plots with 0.3 kg ha(-1) lost in 56 days. We conclude that, under high rainfall conditions, there is an inherent problem in managing mineral N originating from mineralization of organic materials as it accumulates at the onset of rains, and is susceptible to leaching before the crop root system develops. We did not quantify nitric oxide and N(2) gas emissions, but it is unlikely that total gaseous N losses would be significant and contribute to poor N recovery that has been widely reported.

Effect of crop residue C:N ratio on N2O emissions from Gray Lowland soil in Mikasa, Hokkaido, Japan. We studied the effect of crop residues with various C:N ratios on N2O emissions from soil. We set up five experimental plots with four types of crop residues, onion leaf (OL), soybean stem and leaf (SSL), rice straw (RS) and wheat straw (WS), and no residue (NR) on Gray Lowland soil in Mikasa, Hokkaido, Japan. The C:N ratios of these crop residues were 11.6, 14.5, 62.3, and 110, respectively. Based on the results of a questionnaire survey of farmer practices, we determined appropriate application rates: 108, 168, 110, 141 and 0 g C m(-2) and 9.3, 11.6, 1.76, 1.28 and 0 g N m(-2), respectively. We measured N2O, CO2 and NO fluxes using a closed chamber method. At the same time, we measured soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm, water-filled pore space (WFPS), and the concentrations of soil NH4+-N, NO3--N and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC). Significant peaks of N2O and CO2 emissions came from OL and SSL just after application, but there were no emissions from RS, WS or NR. There was a significant relationship between N2O and CO2 emissions in each treatment except WS, and correlations between CO2 flux and temperature in RS, soil NH4+-N and N2O flux in SSL and NR, soil NH4+-N and CO2 flux in SSL, and WSOC and CO2 flux in WS. The ratio of N2O-N/NO-N increased to approximately 100 in OL and SSL as N2O emissions increased. Cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions increased as the C:N ratio decreased, but not significantly. The ratio of N2O emission to applied N ranged from -0.43% to 0.86%, and was significantly correlated with C:N ratio (y = -0.59 ln [x] + 2.30, r(2) = 0.99, P < 0.01).

NOX fluxes from several typical agricultural fields during summer-autumn in the Yangtze Delta, China.

The average NO fluxes from the rice fields (RF), celery field (CE), maize field (MA) and cowpea field (CP) were 4.1, 30.8, 54 and 32.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively; and the average NO2 fluxes were -2.12, 0.68, 1.33 and 0.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The liquid N fertilizer (the mixture of swine excrement and urine) which is widely applied to vegetable lands by Chinese farmers was found to quickly stimulate NO emission, and have significant contribution to NO emission from the investigated vegetable lands. Apparent linearity correlations were found between NO2 fluxes and the ambient concentrations of the rice fields, with a compensation point of about 2.84 mu g m(-3). Total emissions of NO during summer-autumn time from this area were roughly estimated to be 4.1 and 8.4 Gg N for rice field and vegetable lands, respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of nitrogen placement and tillage on NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 fluxes from a clay loam soil. To evaluate the impact of N placement depth and no-till (NT) practice on the emissions of NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 from soils, we conducted two N placement experiments in a long-term tillage experiment site in northeastern Colorado in 2004. Trace gas flux measurements were made 2-3 times per week, in zero-N fertilizer plots that were cropped continuously to corn (Zea mays L.) under conventional-till (CT) and NT. Three N placement depths, replicated four times (5, 10 and 15 cm in Exp. 1 and 0, 5 and 10 cm in Exp. 2, respectively) were used. Liquid urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN, 224 kg N ha(-1)) was injected to the desired depth in the CT- or NT-soils in each experiment. Mean flux rates of NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 ranged from 3.9 to 5.2 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), 60.5 to 92.4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), -0.8 to 0.5 mu g C m(-2) h(-1), and 42.1 to 81.7 mg C m(-2) h(-1) in both experiments, respectively. Deep N placement (10 and 15 cm) resulted in lower NO and N2O emissions compared with shallow N placement (0 and 5 cm) while CH4 and CO2 emissions were not affected by N placement in either experiment. Compared with N placement at 5 cm, for instance, averaged N2O emissions from N placement at 10 cm were reduced by more than 50% in both experiments. Generally, NT decreased NO emission and CH4 oxidation but increased N2O emissions compared with CT irrespective of N placement depths. Total net global warming potential (GWP) for N2O, CH4 and CO2 was reduced by deep N placement only in Exp. 1 but was increased by NT in both experiments. The study results suggest that deep N placement (e.g., 10 cm) will be an effective option for reducing N oxide emissions and GWP from both fertilized CT- and NT-soils.

Tillage-induced environmental conditions in soil and substrate limitation determine biogenic gas production. Tillage changes soil environmental conditions and controls the distribution of residues in the soil, both actions that affect the production and emission of soil biogenic gases (CO2, N2O, and CH4). The objective of this study was to determine how tillage-induced environmental conditions and substrate quality affect the mineralization rate of easily metabolizable compounds and the subsequent production of these gases. Carbon compounds, with and without nitrogen, were applied to soil cropped to maize under tilled and no-till systems. Following substrate application in the spring and summer, biogenic gases were measured periodically at the soil surface (flux) and within the profile (concentration) at 10-, 20-, and 30-cm depths (i.e., within, at the bottom of, and below the plough layer). Strong CO2 and N2O responses to sucrose and glycine in both the field and the laboratory indicate that the soil was C- and N-limited. Surface fluxes of CO2 and N2O were greater in soils amended with glycine than with sucrose and were greater in tilled than no-till soils. Transient emission of CH4 following the addition of glycine was observed and could be attributed to inhibition of N mineralization and nitrification processes on CH4 oxidation. Laboratory and field measurements indicated that the larger substrate-induced CO2 emission from the tilled soils could not be attributed to differences in the total biomass or the basal respiratory activity of the soils. Thus, there appears to be no underlying difference in the functional capacity of the microbial communities under different tillage regimes. Comparison of gas profiles indicates relative accumulation of CO2 at depth in soils under no-till, as well as greater decline in profile CO2 content with time in the tilled compared to the no-till soil. These results support the conclusion that greater CO2 efflux from the tilled soils resulted from more rapid gas diffusion through the profile. Hence, the observed differences in gas fluxes between tilled and no-till soils can be attributed to differences in physical environment. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In a study on the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from maize production in South-West Germany, N2O emissions where measured with an automated chamber system over two consecutive cropping seasons, including an intermediate fallow period. Urea-based fertilizer treatments included a fertilizer only control (U), as well as the use of pyraclostrobin, which showed inhibitory effects on denitrification in a laboratory experiment. Pyraclostrobin was used alone (U + P) and in combination with a NBPT/NPPT urease inhibitor (UI + P) and a reduced fertilizer rate (70% UI + P). The U control emitted 1.03 +/- 0.22 and 1.94 +/- 0.61 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the cropping seasons of 2012 and 2013, respectively. Fallow emissions mainly occurred after a soil freeze-thaw period and were 0.24 +/- 0.08, 0.23 +/- 0.09, 0.22 +/- 0.06, 0.32 +/- 0.21 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for U, 70% UI + P, U + P and UI + P, respectively. In the cropping season 2012, no effects of the UI + P and U + P treatments could be observed. In 2013, UI + P increased N2O emissions by 13% when compared to the U control, while a significant reduction of 24% was observed for the U + P treatment. The 70% UI + P treatment resulted in significantly lower (similar to 30%) N2O emissions and only slight reductions (7-10%) of grain yields in both years. Climate conditions varied strongly between seasons (416 and 704 mm total rainfall in 2012 and 2013, respectively) which most likely also influenced the performance of the inhibitors. Direct emission factors (EFd%) also increased strongly in 2013 (0.28 +/- 0.12 in 2012 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.41 in 2013 for U) but were generally lower than the 1% IPCC default value. Values for nitrogen recovery efficiency and yield-scaled N2O emissions were most preferable for the 70% UI + P treatment and indicate that reduced fertilizer rates in combination with inhibitors could represent a viable means for N2O mitigation without significant yield penalties in agricultural systems.

Can soluble organic fertilizers and/or manure reach the agronomic and environmental performance of synthetic fertilizers in drip-fertigated crops?. The substitution of synthetics by organic fertilizers, which is the current pillar of circular economy, has been broadly evaluated. However, varying results were obtained on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions as well as crop yields. Besides, in irrigated semi-arid croplands, drip fertigation has been suggested to be an effective practice for mitigating N2O and NO emissions while maintaining or enhancing agronomic performance. However, the promising combination of drip fertigation and organic fertilization remains poorly studied. By setting up melon (Cucumis melo L.) during 2022, and maize (Zea mays L.) during 2023, we aimed to evaluate the effect of different combinations of nitrogen (N) fertilizers: control without N fertilization, 100% of the N rate as solid manure (100OrM), 50% of the N rate as solid manure and 50% as urea (50OrM-50Syn), 50% of the N rate as solid manure and 50% as soluble organic (50OrM-50OrS), 100% of the N rate as urea (100Syn) and 100% of the N rate as soluble organic (100OrS). Urea and soluble organic fertilizers were supplied via drip fertigation. N-oxides (N2O and NO), methane (CH4) and ecosystem respiration (CO2) fluxes, mineral N (ammonium [NH4+] and nitrate [NO3-]), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and crop parameters were analysed. As regards N2O, no differences were observed between treatments in melon crop, whereas in maize crop, the cumulative emissions were the highest in 100OrM, followed by 50OrM-50Syn. Regarding NO cumulative emissions, in the melon crop were significantly lower in 50OrM-50Syn and 50OrM-50OrS between 34%-54%, compared with 100OrM and 100Syn. In the maize crop, the highest cumulative NO emission was also detected in solid manure treatment. The agronomic response of melon to N fertilization was only detected for total soluble solids (with maximum values in the 100Syn treatment). The combination of solid manure and top-dressing urea or soluble organic fertilizer prevented the penalties in N use efficiency, which were observed in 100Syn and 100OrS. Therefore, the combination of conventional solid manure at seeding and soluble organic fertilizer at dressing (applied by drip fertigation) was the most sustainable strategy from agronomic and environmental viewpoints in Mediterranean irrigated agroecosystems.

Dynamics of bacterial functional genes and community structures during rhizoremediation of diesel-contaminated compost-amended soil. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of organic soil amendment (compost) on bacterial populations associated with petroleum hydrocarbon (PH) degradation and nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics via pot experiments. Soil was artificially contaminated with diesel oil at total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration of 30,000 mg.kg-soil(-1) and compost was mixed with the contaminated soil at a 1:9 ratio (w/w). Maize seedlings were planted in each pot and a total of ten pots with two treatments (compost-amended and unamended) were prepared. The pot experiment was conducted for 85 days. The compost-amended soil had a significantly higher TPH removal efficiency (51.1%) than unamended soil (21.4%). Additionally, the relative abundance of the alkB gene, which is associated with PH degradation, was higher in the compost-amended soil than in the unamended soil. Similarly, cnorB and nosZ (which are associated with nitric oxide (NO) and N2O reduction, respectively) were also highly upregulated in the compost-amended soil. Moreover, the compost-amended soil exhibited higher richness and evenness indices, indicating that bacterial diversity was higher in the amended soil than in the unamended soil. Therefore, our findings may contribute to the development of strategies to enhance remediation efficiency and greenhouse gas mitigation during the rhizoremediation of diesel-contaminated soils.

Effect of chemical fertilizer and manure application on N2O emission from reed canary grassland in Hokkaido, Japan. We evaluated the effect of chemical fertilizer and manure applications on N2O emission from a managed grassland by establishing three treatment plots of chemical N fertilizer (chemical fertilizer), manure combined with chemical N fertilizer (manure) and no N fertilizer (control) at the Shizunai Experimental Livestock Farm in southern Hokkaido, Japan. The N2O fluxes from the soils were measured using a closed-chamber method from May 2005 to April 2008. Soil denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) in the root-mat layer (0-2.5 cm) and in the mineral soil layer (2.5-5 cm) of each treatment plot was measured using an acetylene inhibition method after treatment with NO3--N addition, glucose addition, both NO3--N and glucose addition or neither NO3--N nor glucose addition. Annual N2O emission ranged from 0.6 to 4.9 kg N2O-N ha-1year-1, with the highest emission observed in the manure plot and the lowest in the control plot. The chemical fertilizer induced emission factor (EF) (range: 0.85-1.32%) was significantly higher than the manure-induced EF (range: 0.35-0.85%). The denitrification potential of the soil horizons was measured with the addition of both NO3--N and glucose, and was significantly higher in root-mat soil than in mineral soil. Soil DEA in the root mat with the addition of NO3--N with and without the addition of glucose had a significantly positive correlation with soil pH (P < 0.05). Soil pH was significantly influenced by N source, which was significantly lower in the chemical fertilizer plot than in the control and manure plots. For a fixed quantity of available N, the application of manure could result in higher N2O emission compared with chemical fertilizer, owing to higher soil pH values under manure application than under chemical fertilizer application.

Greenhouse gas fluxes and NO release from a Chinese subtropical rice-winter wheat rotation system under nitrogen fertilizer management. Although synthetic nitrogen fertilizers play an important role in increasing cereal grain yields, there have been increased concerns about their intensive utilization and environmental consequences. The overall goal of this study is to gain an insight into the integrated evaluation of greenhouse gas emission and nitric oxide (NO) release and grain yield as affected by nitrogen fertilization in a subtropical rice-wheat rotation system. The assessment was based on four consecutive yearly measurements of the fluxes of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ecosystem respiration (CO2), and the simultaneous observation of NO emissions in nonrice seasons under three fertilization practices (i.e., the conventional farmers' practice with common nitrogen application rate, an alternative practice with reduced nitrogen input, and no nitrogen application as a control). Clearly, these trace gas fluxes showed largely intra-annual and interannual variations, highlighting the importance of entire year measurement for multiple years to achieve representative annual estimates. The annual mean CH4 fluxes varied from 95 kg C ha(-1) (7.8 kg C t(-1) grain) for the farmers' practice to 205 kg C ha(-1) (25.7 kg C t(-1) grain) for the control, indicating that nitrogen fertilization inhibited CH4 emissions. Across all the years, the annual N2O emissions increased exponentially with an increasing nitrogen rate and harvested aboveground biomass. The annual N2O emission averaged 1.3-5.3 kg N ha(-1)(159-444 g N t(-1) grain) for all treatments. The annual direct emission factors of N2O-N tended to increase with increasing nitrogen rate and averaged 0.61% and 0.85% for the alternative and farmers' practices, respectively. Over all nonrice seasons, the seasonal mean NO emissions ranged from 0.15 to 1.4 kg N ha(-1)(58-253 g N t(-1) grain), and were equivalent to 0.43% to 0.54% of the applied nitrogen. Averaging across the 4 years, the annual aggregate emissions of CH4 and N2O were 7.4 t CO2-eq ha(-1)(928 kg CO2-eq t(-1)grain) for the control and 5.6-5.7 t CO2-eq ha(-1)(468-494 kg CO2-eq t(-1)grain) for the fertilized treatments. Despite the comparable greenhouse effect between the alternative and farmers' practices, reducing the common N rate by 37% resulted in decreased NO emission and increased nitrogen use efficiency, and negligible effects on economic return from grain yields.

Soil mineral N dynamics and N2O emissions following grassland renewal. Managed grasslands are periodically renewed in north-western Europe, primarily in response to a decline in yield and nutritive value or sward damage. Grassland conversion to arable land is also a common agricultural practice on intensively used grassland sites. However, depending on the soil and its management, grassland break-up (i.e. the destruction of the grass sward and soil disturbance) is associated with the mineralisation of soil organic nitrogen (N) and the decomposition of stubbles and roots from the old grass sward, with both leading to enhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3-) leaching. Two sites were set up to investigate the effects of different grassland renewal techniques (keeping and improving the old sward, chemical sward killing and chemical killing of the sward followed by ploughing) with grassland conversion to maize cropping and permanent grassland as the reference treatments. The sites (Histic Gleysol and a Plaggic Anthrosol) differed in their organic matter content and groundwater level. N2O fluxes were measured weekly using static closed chambers for a period of two years. The relationship between N2O fluxes and explanatory/controlling variables was investigated using generalised additive models (GAM). The potential NO3- losses via NO3- leaching were quantified by taking weekly measurements of the soil mineral N (Mak) from the topsoil layer (0-30 cm) and from depth profiles (0-90 cm) in the autumn (pre-winter) and spring (post-winter). The aboveground biomass in the different treatments was also measured. Grassland renewal was not a significant source of direct N2O emissions at either experimental site during the two years of the study. There was only a short two-month period during which there were significantly increased N2O fluxes (up to a maximum of 1.6 kg N2O ha-1 day-1 in the Histic Gleysol) and treatment differences. N fertilisation (as reflected in the N content in soil), soil moisture, and microbial and plant respiratory activity were identified as important drivers of N2O emission. The destruction of the old grass sward (i.e. chemical killing by herbicide application and ploughing and conversion to maize cropping) resulted in an increased net N release of Nmin during the first year, which indicated losses via indirect N2O emission and a higher risk of NO3- leaching, especially on the sandy Plaggic Anthrosol. No yield effects were found after grassland renewal at either site. With respect to N2O mitigation and the prevention of NO3- leaching, it is recommended that the new grass sward should be rapidly established as a sink for Nmin and that the amount of available mineralised N following grassland renewal is taken into account when applying N fertiliser, as mineralisation following sward destruction provides high amounts of plant-available N.

Ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting can significantly reduce N2O emissions from spring maize fields in semiarid regions of China. The ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting (RFRH) system is an effective method for enhancing the rainfall water use efficiency and crop yield. Determining how the fertilization rate affects soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under the RFRH system has important practical significance for improving fertilization strategies and evaluating the environmental effects of the RFRH system. Therefore, we conducted a three-year field experiment in the Loess Plateau, China, to compare the RFRH system with traditional flat planting (T) at four different fertilizer rates (no fertilizer, N:P2O5 at 150:75 kg ha(-1), N:P2O5 at 300:150 kg ha(-1), and N:P2O5 at 450:225 kg ha(-1)). Under the same fertilization level, the soil water content (SWC) and dry matter were higher under RFRH compared with T, and the nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) content and N2O emissions were reduced. In the two planting models, SWC and NO3--N of each treatment and its corresponding N2O emission flux were significantly positively correlated. Under the same planting model, SWC decreased but NO3--N and the N2O emission increased with increasing fertilization rate. SWC was the key variable affecting the N2O emission flux in the RFRH system. In addition, the grain yield under RFRH increased by 2.2-28.0%, whereas the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) decreased by 1.0-16.1% and 13.0-56.8%, respectively, compared with T. The grain yield and GHGI had quadratic relationships with the fertilization rate. Moreover, GWP increased in a linear manner with the fertilizer rate. These findings suggest that the RFRH system is an effective tillage measure for reducing N2O emissions. When the N:P2O5 fertilization rate was 200:100 to 307:154 kg ha(-1), the RFRH system could maintain a higher grain yield and reduce the N2O emissions.

Effect of urea placement on the time-depth profiles of NO, N2O and mineral nitrogen concentrations in an Andisol during a Chinese cabbage growing season. To evaluate the effects of urea placement on the concentration profiles of soil gases (NO and N2O) and mineral nitrogen, we conducted an experiment in a Chinese cabbage field in Tsukuba, Japan, over one cultivation season. Soil gas and mineral nitrogen concentrations at different depths (0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.45 and 0.6 m) were measured 1-2 times per week in experimental plots fertilized by either urea incorporation (U-I; uniformly spread over the soil surface and incorporated down to approximately 0.15-0.2 m) or by urea deep band (U-DB; placed in 0.12-m-deep trenches cut at intervals of 0.6 m). Considerable NO was observed in the top 0.2 m of soil in the U-I treatment during the first 2 weeks after fertilization (WAF), whereas in soil in the U-DB treatment NO was observed only at depths of 0.1 and 0.15 m for approximately 6 WAF. In U-I, the maximum soil N2O concentration was observed 5 days after fertilization (DAF). Significantly high N2O concentration in soil of U-DB was observed 2 WAF, and lasted longer than that in UI (4 vs 2 weeks). The NH4+ concentrations in U-I exceeded background levels during the first 2 WAF, with a maximum 5 DAF. The high NH4+ concentrations in soil in the U-DB treatment, mainly located within the 0.05-0.15-m soil zone, lasted approximately 6 weeks, with a maximum at 9 DAF. The NO3- concentrations in both U-I and U-DB increased shortly after the application of urea; the increases were higher in U-I than in U-DB. These time-depth series of concentration profiles clearly demonstrate the effect of urea placement on NO and N2O production and transportation in soil and provide a better understanding of the emission dynamics of these gases than previous reports. In addition, comparison of NO and N2O emissions among field, laboratory and numerical experiments firmly suggests that deep urea placement is highly effective in reducing NO emissions, with less effect on N2O emissions from Andisols.

Soil N2O emissions in French Guiana after the conversion of tropical forest to agriculture with the chop-and-mulch method. In French Guiana, the population growth will result in an increase in demand for agricultural products and thus, will lead to an increase in the amount of tropical forests converted into cropland or pasture. Impacts of different agricultural systems on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes have not been studied in French Guiana. In this context, the fire-free chop-and-mulch method was used to convert a tropical forest site to agriculture. This study focused on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and we compared four land uses: (1) the undisturbed tropical forest, (2) recently converted grassland and recently converted croplands (fertilized soybean/maize rotation) with either (3) disk tillage or (4) no tillage. N2O measurements were obtained through the chamber technique and conducted over a 1-year period (measurements began 19 months after the forest was cleared). N2O fluxes were related to soil parameters measured at each sampling date: nitrate and ammonium contents, gravimetric water content (GWC) and temperature. Through the entire period, the mean (+/- standard error) and median N2O fluxes were 3.8 +/- 0.5 and 2.7 g N ha(-1) day(-1), respectively for undisturbed tropical forest and 2.4 +/- 0.9 and 0.8 g N ha(-1) day(-1), respectively for grassland (mowed Brachiaria ruziziensis). For croplands, no significant difference was found for N2O emissions between both agricultural practices. The mean ( standard error) and median N2O fluxes were 8.5 +/- 1.2 and 4.0 g N ha(-1) day(-1), respectively for disk tillage plots and 8.5 +/- 1.3 and 3.6 g N ha(-1) day(-1), respectively for no tillage plots. Nitrogen inputs (due to the application of fertilizer or due to the mineralization of crop residues) led to higher N2O fluxes, resulting in significantly higher mean N2O emissions from croplands compared to the forest, when only considering land use effect on N2O fluxes in a statistical model. The soil nitrate content, GWC and temperature had a significant positive effect on N2O fluxes. Taking into account these soil parameters in another statistical model, N2O emissions from croplands were not higher than the natural N2O emissions from tropical forest soils. Our results suggest that, if more forest will have to be converted in the course of the expected population growth in French Guiana, it could have low impact on the soil N2O fluxes (similar to natural fluxes from forest) with the improving of farming techniques (for example modification of the splitting of N-fertilizer) in the cropping plots.

Improved fertiliser management to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions and ensure yields in a wheat-peanut relay intercropping system in China. Over the last century, anthropogenic greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions have changed the global climate, and agriculture plays an important role in the global flux of GHG. Agricultural management practices, such as split N applications and the use of controlled-release fertilisers have significantly increased the crop yield and N-use efficiency by balancing the N demand of crops and the N availability of soils. However, the impacts of these practices on GHG emissions (in particular in wheat-peanut relay intercropping systems) have not been evaluated in detail. In this study, a common compound fertiliser and a controlled release compound fertiliser (CRF) were used the day prior to sowing, at the jointing stage of wheat and at the peanut anthesis stage in ratios of 50-50-0% (JCF100), 35-35-30% (JCF70) and 35-35-30% (JCRF70), with a control treatment of 0 kg ha(-1). The findings demonstrated that treatment JCF70 achieved increases in yields of 9.7% and 14.6% for wheat grain and peanut pod, respectively, compared to treatment JCF100; however, this treatment also significantly increased soil emissions of CO2 and N2O. In addition, cumulative emissions of CO2 and N2O were higher in the peanut growing season by 74.4 and 31.7%, respectively, than in the wheat growing season owing to the relatively higher soil temperature during the former season. Fertilisation combined with irrigation, was found to be the main cause of GHG emissions. Under the same fertiliser rate and N-management style, JCRF70 further increased the yield of peanut pods and the total combined yield of peanut and wheat by 10.3% and 8.9%, respectively, compared to treatment JCF70. The cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions in treatment JCRF70 were 20.4-45.4% less than those in treatment JCF70. The total global warming potentials of CO2 and N2O were lowest in treatment JCRF70 owing to it providing the highest grain yield. Therefore, N application with three splits, together with the use of a slow-release fertiliser, may be a simple and effective approach to enhance the grain yield whilst reducing the GHG emissions.

The crop rotation had a positive net ecosystem production (NEP) of 4.4 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) but represented a net source of carbon with a net biome production (NBP) of -1.3 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). The nitrogen balance of the rotation was correlated with the carbon balance and resulted in net loss (-24 +/- 28 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). The main nitrogen losses were nitrate leaching (-11.7 +/- 1.0 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and ammonia volatilization (-9 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Dry and wet depositions were 6.7 +/- 3.0 and 5.9 +/- 0.1 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Fluxes of nitrous (N2O) and nitric (NO) oxides did not contribute significantly to the N budget (N2O: -1.8 +/- 0.04; NO: -0.7 +/- 0.04 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) but N2O fluxes equaled 16% of the total greenhouse gas balance. The link between the carbon and nitrogen balances are discussed. Longer term experiments would be necessary to capture the trends in the carbon and nitrogen budgets within the variability of agricultural ecosystems.

Integrated assessment of the impact of enhanced-efficiency nitrogen fertilizer on N2O emission and crop yield. Enhanced-efficiency nitrogen fertilizer (EENF) has gained considerable attention for improving nitrogen use efficiency and mitigating N2O emission in many agro-ecosystems. However, the effectiveness of EENF is highly variable under field condition. The factors influencing the efficacy of EENF are not well understood. Here, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the key factors affecting the efficacy of EENF in upland cropping systems. The effects of EENF were found to be similar among maize, wheat, and barley, while they varied among different EENF products. Inhibitors (IS), including nitrification inhibitors (NI), urease inhibitors (UI), and the combination of UI and NI, significantly mitigated N2O emission and increased crop yield, resulting in a greater reduction in yield-scaled N2O emission compared with slow- or control-releasing fertilizer (S/CRF). Reductions in yield-scaled N2O emission response to IS and S/CRF were both greater in arid regions than in humid regions. Soil pH and texture had less impact on the effect of IS than S/CRF. The efficacy of IS and S/CRF were not significant when N use rates were between 120 and 180 kg N ha(-1). Surface broadcasting were unfavorable for mitigating N2O emissions with both IS and S/CRF. The impact of tillage on the efficacy of IS and S/CRF was affected by climate. The effectiveness of S/CRF depended more on these factors than did IS. This meta-analysis highlighted the necessity to connect EENF products with specific climatic, soil, and agronomic attributes for predicting their effectiveness. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a modified DNDC biogeochemical model to optimize field management of a multi-crop (cotton, wheat, and maize) system: a site-scale case study in northern China. It is still a severe challenge to optimize the field management practices for a multi-crop system when simultaneously aiming at yield sustainability and minimum negative impacts on climate as well as atmosphere and water quality. This site-scale case study was devoted to developing a biogeochemical process model-based approach as a solution to this challenge. The best management practices (BMPs) of a three-crop system growing cotton and winter wheat-summer maize (W-M) in rotation, which is widely adopted in northern China, were identified. The BMPs referred to the management alternatives with the lowest negative impact potentials (NIPs) among the scenarios satisfying all given constraints. The independent variables used to determine the NIPs and those utilized as constrained criteria were simulated by the DeNitrification-DeComposition model, which was modified in this study. Due to the unsatisfactory performance of the model in daily simulations of nitric oxide (NO) emission and net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE), the model was modified to (i) newly parameterize the soil moisture effects on NO production during nitrification, and (ii) replace the original NEE calculation approach with an algorithm based on gross primary production. Validation of the modified model showed statistically meaningful agreements between the simulations and observations in the cotton and W-M fields. Three BMP alternatives with overlapping uncertainties of simulated NIPs were screened from 6000 management scenarios randomly generated by Latin hypercube sampling. All of these BMP alternatives adopted the baseline (currently applied) practices of crop rotation (3 consecutive years of cotton rotating with 3 years of W-M in each 6-year cycle), the fraction of crop residue incorporation (100 %), and deep tillage (30 cm) for cotton. At the same time, these BMP alternatives would use 18% less fertilizer nitrogen and sprinkle or flood-irrigate similar to 23% less water than the baseline while adopting reduced tillage (5 cm) for W-M. Compared with the baseline practices, these BMP alternatives could simultaneously sustain crop yields, annually enlarge the soil organic carbon stock by 4 parts per thousand or more, mitigate the aggregate emission of greenhouse gases, NO release, ammonia volatilization, and nitrate leaching by similar to 7 %, similar to 25 %, similar to 2 %, and similar to 43 %, respectively, despite a similar to 5% increase in N2O emission. However, further study is still necessary for field confirmation of these BMP alternatives. Nevertheless, this case study proposed a practical approach to optimize multi-crop system management to simultaneously achieve multiple United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Assessing agronomic and environmental implications of different N fertilisation strategies in subtropical grain cropping systems on Oxisols. A multi-season N-15 tracer recovery experiment was conducted on an Oxisol cropped with wheat, maize and sorghum to compare crop N recoveries of different fertilisation strategies and determine the main pathways of N losses that limit N recovery in these agroecosystems. In the wheat and maize seasons, N-15-labelled fertiliser was applied as conventional urea (CONV) and urea coated with a nitrification inhibitor (DMPP). In sorghum, the fate of N-15-labelled urea was monitored in this crop following a legume ley pasture (L70) or a grass ley pasture (G100). The fertiliser N applied to sorghum in the legume-cereal rotation was reduced (70 kg N ha(-1)) compared to the grass-cereal (100 kg N ha(-1)) to assess the availability of the N residual from the legume ley pasture. Average crop N recoveries were 73 % (CONV) and 77 % (DMPP) in wheat and 50 % (CONV) and 51 % (DMPP) in maize, while in sorghum were 71 % (L70) and 53 % (G100). Data gathered in this study indicate that the intrinsic physical and chemical conditions of Oxisols can be extremely effective in limiting N losses via deep leaching or denitrification. Elevated crop N-15 recoveries can be therefore obtained in subtropical Oxisols using conventional urea while in these agroecosystems DMPP urea has no significant scope to increase fertiliser N recovery in the crop. Overall, introducing a legume phase to limit the fertiliser N requirements of the following cereal crop proved to be the most effective strategy to reduce N losses and increase fertiliser N recovery.

Cropland nitrogen dioxide emissions and effects on the ozone pollution in the North China plain. Soil nitrogen dioxide (NOX = NO2 + NO) emissions have been measured and estimated to be the second most significant contributor to the NOX burden following the fossil fuel combustion source globally. NOX emissions from croplands are subject to being underestimated or overlooked in air pollution simulations of regional atmospheric chemistry models. With constraints of ground and space observations of NO2, the WRF-Chem model is used to investigate the cropland NOX emission and its contribution to the near-surface ozone (O-3) pollution in North China Plain (NCP) during a growing season as a case study. Model simulations have revealed that the cropland NOX emissions are underestimated by around 80% without constraints of satellite measured NO2 column densities. The biogenic NOX source is estimated to account for half of the anthropogenic NOX emissions in the NCP during the growing season. Additionally, the cropland NOX source contributes around 5.0% of the maximum daily average 8h O-3 concentration and 27.7% of NO2 concentration in the NCP. Our results suggest the agriculture NOX emission exerts non-negligible impacts on the summertime air quality and needs to be considered when designing emission abatement strategies.

Annual emissions of N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3 from maize-wheat fields in the North China Plain. Fertilized agricultural soil is a significant source of gaseous nitrogen compounds (GNCs), including N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3. The North China Plain (NCP) is the \"hot region\" for the release of these GNCs due to intensive fertilization practices. However, existing research has primarily focused on N2O emissions from fertilized farmland in the NCP, lacking comprehensive observational studies on other GNCs. Therefore, a continuous cumulative sampling technique (open-top dynamic chamber system) was utilized in this study to simultaneously measure the exchange fluxes of N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3 over summer maize-winter wheat rotation fields in the NCP. Results showed that GNC emissions from the soil displayed distinct diurnal variations, with higher emissions during the day attributed to elevated soil temperature. However, N2O emissions remained consistent between day and night, potentially influenced not only by soil temperature but also by soil humidity. Annual cumulative emissions and emission factors (EFs) for four GNCs were determined, indicating that N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions during the maize season were 1.38-2.37 times higher than those during the wheat season, with 98 % of HONO emissions occurring in the maize season. Additionally, the study first presented the annual HONO EFs of 0.36 +/- 0.03 % in fertilized farmland. Furthermore, a comparison revealed that the fluxes of N2O, NO, NH3, and HONO using the conventional single-point sampling method were 26.4 %, 13.9 %, and 8.10 % lower, and 7.86 % higher compared to the continuous cumulative sampling method recommended in this study. In general, this study provided precise measurements of GNC emissions from farmland, offering essential foundational data for modeling parameters and contributing to the formulation of regional air pollution prevention and control policies.

The effect of drip irrigation and drip fertigation on N2O and NO emissions, water saving and grain yields in a maize field in the North China Plain. N2O and NO emissions, the water usage and grain yields of a maize field in the North China Plain (NCP) under traditional flood irrigation, drip irrigation and drip fertigation were compared. With respect to the flood irrigation treatment, N2O emissions were reduced by 13.8% in the drip irrigation treatment and 7.7% in the drip fertigation treatment. NO emissions were reduced to 16.7% in the drip irrigation treatment but increased by 21.7% in the drip fertigation treatment. The molar ratios of NO/N2O within 2 days after each fertilization event were evidently greater from the drip fertigation treatment than from the flood irrigation treatment, indicating that nitrification was more intensive in the drip fertigation treatment than in the treatment of flood irrigation. Compared with the flood irrigation treatment, evident increase of the maize yields in the drip irrigation treatment (28%) and the drip fertigation treatment (3.7%) were found. Although the drip fertigation treatment could evidently increase NO emission, the 40% water reduction in drip fertigation is of great importance for the sustainable development of agriculture in the NCP where water resources are extremely limited. To mitigate NO emissions from agricultural fields in the NCP with drip fertigation, the addition of a nitrification inhibitor combined with N or nitrate fertilizer was recommended.

Fertilization-driven pulses of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide complicate air pollution in early spring over the North China Plain. Atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has shown periodic conspicuous pulses in the tropospheric column in March over the North China Plain during the past two decades. However, these repetitive pulses have never been reported, and their underlying causes remain unclear. Here, we present robust evidence to demonstrate that agricultural fertilization drives the early spring NO2 column increase. The fertilization-driven soil NOx (= NO+NO2) emissions, comparable to anthropogenic sources, exert complicated influences on regional air quality. They significantly reduce nocturnal and diurnal O3 concentrations in agricultural areas in early spring, distinct from the scenarios in summer, but increase fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations via strongly enhancing nitrate aerosol formation. The impact also extends to urban areas, approximately half that of agricultural areas. These findings have increasing implications for coordinated control of PM2.5 and O3 under global warming. We thus suggest that reducing NOx emissions in croplands is essential to achieve better air quality in agricultural countries and regions.

Effect of N fertilizer types on N2O and NO emissions under drip fertigation from an agricultural field in the North China Plain. N2O and NO emissions from a winter wheat-summer maize rotation field in the North China Plain were comparably investigated under three different treatments: 1) flood irrigation (A-Flood treatment) plus fertilization of NH4Cl, 2) drip fertigation (A-Drip treatment) plus fertilization of NH4Cl and 3) drip fertigation (AN-Drip treatment) plus fertilization of a mixture of Ca(NO3)(2) and NH4Cl. The annual N2O cumulative emissions from the A-Drip treatment and the A-Flood treatment were almost identical, whereas it from the AN-Drip treatment was significantly lower (33%) than that from the A-Flood treatment. Compared with the A-Flood treatment, the annual NO cumulative emission from the A-Drip treatment was significantly increased by 140% but it from the AN-Drip treatment was only slightly increased by 14%. Compared with drip fertigation with NH4Cl, drip fertigation with the mixture of Ca(NO3)(2) and NH4Cl significantly reduced the cumulative emissions of N2O (31%) and NO (52%) from the nitrification dominated fields by decreasing the supplement of NH4+ substrate. Among the three fertilization treatments, the yields of the maize from the A-Drip and AN-Drip treatments were significantly increased, while the yields of the wheat were almost the same. Considering the benefit of increasing yields and reducing N fertilizer and water input, the application of nitrate-based fertilizer instead of partial ammonium-based fertilizer through drip fertigation could be a promising method for keeping agronomic productivity and environmental sustainability.

The three treatments included control plot (CK, without crop, fertilization and irrigation), fertilizer N plot (NP) and wheat straw returning plus fertilizer N plot (SN). N-fertilizer application greatly stimulated the emissions of N2O, NOx and NH3, with durations of about 10 days for N2O and NO, and about 7 days for NH3. Fertilizer loss rates were 1.08% (NP plot) and 1.20% (SN plot) as N2O-N, were 1.93% (NP plot) and 0.76% (SN plot) as NO-N, and were 5.24% (NP plot) and 3.03% (SN plot) as NH3-N. In comparison with the NP plot, the significant low fertilizer loss rates as NO-N and NH3-N from the SN plot indicated that the wheat straw returning to the field could reduce NOx and NH3 emissions. The molar ratio of NO/N2O was greater than unity for most data during the pulse emission periods induced by fertilization, and thus, nitrification was the dominant process for N2O and NO emissions during these periods. Considering the significant amount (>80%) of N2O and NOx emissions occurred during the pulse emission periods, the emissions of NOx and N2O from the investigated field were mainly ascribed to nitrification process.

An improved open-top dynamic chambers method for measuring the exchange fluxes of N2 O, NO and NH3 from farmland. The application of nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural fields can lead to the release of nitrogen-containing gases (NCGs), such as NOx , NH3 and N2 O, which can significantly impact regional atmospheric environment and contribute to global climate change. However, there remain considerable research gaps in the accurate measurement of NCGs emissions from agricultural fields, hindering the development of effective emission reduction strategies. We improved an open-top dynamic chambers (OTDCs) system and evaluated the performance by comparing the measured and given fluxes of the NCGs. The results showed that the measured fluxes of NO, N2 O and NH3 were 1 %, 2 % and 7 % lower than the given fluxes, respectively. For the determination of NH3 concentration, we employed a stripping coil-ion chromatograph (SC-IC) analytical technique, which demonstrated an absorption efficiency for atmospheric NH3 exceeding 96.1 % across sampling durations of 6 to 60 min. In the summer maize season, we utilized the OTDCs system to measure the exchange fluxes of NO, NH3 , and N2 O from the soil in the North China Plain. Substantial emissions of NO, NH3 and N2 O were recorded following fertilization, with peaks of 107, 309, 1239 ng N/(m2 <middle dot>s), respectively. Notably, significant NCGs emissions were observed following sustained heavy rainfall one month after fertilization, particularly with NH3 peak being 4.5 times higher than that observed immediately after fertilization. Our results demonstrate that the OTDCs system accurately reflects the emission characteristics of soil NCGs and meets the requirements for long-term and continuous flux observation.

Compared with the treatments with only flood or drip irrigation, evident emission peaks of N2O and NO from the fertilization treatments with flood irrigation (A-Flood) and with drip fertigation (A-Drip) were observed after each fertilization event, whereas their emissions from the fertilization treatments with nitrification inhibitors under drip fertigation (A + DCD-Drip and A + Nitrapyrin-Drip) were greatly suppressed. The reduction effect of the nitrification inhibitors on N2O and NO emissions was found to be more conspicuous during the maize season than during the wheat season, implying that the soil temperature could play an important role in the reduction effect.

Effects of Maize-Soybean Intercropping on Nitrous Oxide Emissions from a Silt Loam Soil in the North China Plain. Maize (Zea mays L.), a staple crop in the North China Plain, contributing substantially to agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in this region. Many studies have focused on various agricultural management measures to reduce N2O emissions. However, few have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems. In the current study, we investigate whether maize-soybean intercropping treatments could reduce N2O emission rates. Two differently configured maize-soybean intercropping treatments, 2:2 intercropping (two rows of maize and two rows of soybean, 2M2S) and 2:1 intercropping (two rows of maize and one row of soybean, 2M1S), and monocultured maize (M) and soybean (S) treatments were performed using a static chamber method. The results showed no distinct yield advantage for the intercropping systems. The total N2O production from the various treatments was 0.15 +/- 0.04-113.85 +/- 12.75 mu g m(-2) min(-1). The cumulative N2O emission from the M treatment was 16.9 +/- 2.3 kg ha(-1) over the entire growing season (three and a half months), which was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the 2M2S and 2M1S treatments by 36.6% and 32.2%, respectively. Two applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (as urea) at 240 kg N ha(-1) each induced considerable soil N2O fluxes. Short-term N2O emissions (within one week after each of the two N applications) accounted for 74.4%-83.3% of the total emissions. Soil moisture, temperature, and inorganic N were significantly correlated with soil N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.246-0.365, n = 192, P < 0.001). Soil nitrate (NO3-) and moisture decreased in the intercropping treatments during the growing season. These results indicate that maize-soybean intercropping can reduce soil N-2O emissions relative to monocultured maize.

Potential risk of soil reactive gaseous nitrogen emissions under reclaimed water irrigation in a wheat-maize rotation system. Reactive nitrogen gas (Nr) originating from the soil is highly susceptible to the influence of agricultural water and fertilizer management practices, making it a critical gas that can substantially contribute to atmospheric pollution. Understanding the emission patterns of Nr in the surface soil under reclaimed water (RW) irrigation is essential for guiding RW irrigation practices and informing policies aimed at reducing Nr emissions. In this study conducted in Beijing, North China, field sites were selected with different irrigation management strategies and corresponding fertilizer application methods. The two types of irrigation water quality comprised RW irrigation and groundwater (UW) irrigation, whereas the two fertilizer types utilized were calcium ammonium nitrate with a high nitrate nitrogen content and ammonium sulfate with ammonium nitrogen. Nr emissions and concentrations in the soil profile (0-30 cm depth) were monitored throughout key agricultural events, including cultivation, irrigation, fertilization, and harvest, spanning the period from 2020 to 2021. It is observed that RW irrigation effectively reduces cumulative ammonia (NH3) emissions compared to groundwater (UW) treatment. However, it results in increased concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) (12.33%-73.82%) and nitric oxide (NO) (13.74%-36.59%) in the soil within the depth range of 0-30 cm. Of particular importance is the notable increase in the abundance of soil denitrifying and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA-amoA) genes due to RW irrigation, indicating the potential for elevated N2O and NO emissions. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the soil Nr emissions and concentrations are more strongly affected by nitrogen type rather than water quality. Conversely, the inclusion of nitrate has proven to be effective in mitigating N2O and NO emissions in RW-irrigated farmland.

N2O and NO Emissions as Affected by the Continuous Combined Application of Organic and Mineral N Fertilizer to a Soil on the North China Plain. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of the continuous application of organic and mineral N fertilizer on N2O and NO emissions under maize and wheat rotation on the North China Plain. This study included eight treatments: no fertilizer (control); mineral N fertilizer (Nmin) at a rate of 200 kg N ha(-1) per season; 50% mineral fertilizer N plus 50% cattle manure N (50% CM), 50% chicken manure N (50% FC) or 50% pig manure N (50% FP); 75% mineral fertilizer N plus 25% cattle manure N (25% CM), 25% chicken manure N (25% FC) or 25% pig manure N (25% FP). The annual N2O and NO emissions were 2.71 and 0.39 kg N ha(-1), respectively, under the Nmin treatment, with an emission factor of 0.50% for N2O and 0.07% for NO. Compared with the Nmin treatment, N2O emissions did not differ when 50% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (50% CM, 50% FC and 50% FP), while annual NO emissions were significantly reduced by 49.0% and 27.8% under 50% FC and 50% FP, respectively. In contrast, annual N2O emissions decreased by 21-38% compared to the Nmin treatment when 25% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP). Most of the reduction occurred during the maize season. The 25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP treatments had no effect on NO emissions compared to the Nmin treatment. There was no obvious difference in annual N2O and NO emissions among the organic manures at the same application rate, probably due to their similar C/N ratio. Replacing a portion of the mineral fertilizer N with organic fertilizer N did not significantly affect crop grain yield, except for the 50% FC treatment in the wheat season. Overall, the results suggest that the combined application of 25% organic manure N plus 75% mineral fertilizer N had the most potential to mitigate N2O emissions while not affecting crop yield in the maize and wheat rotation system in this area of China.

Characteristics of annual nitrous and nitric oxide emissions from major cereal crops in the North China Plain under alternative fertilizer management. Although nitrogen fertilizer is crucially important for China's crop production, the overuses in the intensive cereal cropping systems of the North China Plain has caused extensive concern for its environmental consequences on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes. To characterize the integration of environmental and agronomic aspects of fertilizer management, we conducted two annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summer maize (Zea mays L.) rotation cycles under five fertilization treatments, including the farmers' conventional practice (CP) amended with synthetic nitrogen, three alternative managements of reduced nitrogen inputs with synthetic fertilizers alone (UA), synthetic fertilizers combined with poultry manure (UA + PM) or controlled-release urea combined with poultry manure (CU + PM), and the control without nitrogen fertilization (CK). The N2O and NO fluxes and direct emission factors varied seasonally and annually. These variations could be interpreted mechanically by a revised \"hole-in-the-pipe\" model and dual Michaelis-Menten and Arrhenius kinetics. The CM, CP, UA, UA + PM, and CU + PM treatments released N2O at 0.65, 4.64, 3.66, 2.88, and 2.40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, and NO at least 0.42, 2.35, 2.24, 1.30, and 1.18 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The annual direct emission factors of N2O and NO were 0.41-0.67% and 0.18-0.32%, respectively. The three alternative managements decreased both N2O and NO emissions, expressed either on an area basis or relative to grain yield, without sacrificing crop yields compared to CP. However, their mitigation effects on each gas emission were different. The UA treatment reduced only N2O emission, while UA + PM and CU + PM showed significant mitigation effects on both gases as compared to CP or UA. Overall, our results provide insight into environmental aspect of fertilizer management in major cereal crops and suggest that reducing nitrogen input coupled with organic manure incorporation could be beneficial for simultaneously mitigating nitrogen-containing trace gas fluxes and sustaining cereal grain yields.

Nitrogen stabilizers mitigate reactive N and greenhouse gas emissions from an arable soil in North China Plain: Field and laboratory investigation. Nitrogen (N) stabilizers such as urease inhibitors (UI) and nitrification inhibitors (NI) are promising tools to mitigate N losses from fertilized soils. To better understand the efficacy of UI and NI, a 2-year field trial was carried out in the North China Plain (NCP) to analyze the impact of UI and NI on NH3 loss and N transformations following urea fertilizer application. Additionally, a laboratory study using an automated continuous-flow incubation system was conducted under controlled conditions, using the same soil, to evaluate the mitigation potential of the N stabilizers on NO, N2O and CO2 emission. The results showed that a novel UI product, Limus (R) (BASF, Germany), containing active ingredients N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) and N-(n-propyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NPPT), limited ammonium formation rate and reduced NH3 loss in both maize (by 85 and 96% for year 1 and 2, respectively) and wheat (by 41 and 64%, for year 1 and 2, respectively) seasons. The 3, 4-dimethypyrazole phosphate (DMPP) amendment significantly retarded nitrate formation rate but the effectiveness was compromised by high ambient temperature; additionally, the NI amendment increased NH3 emission (by 16 and 24% for maize and wheat year 2, respectively). In the laboratory incubation experiment, addition of the UI reduced emissions of NO, N2O and CO2 by 89, 73 and 19%, respectively, while the addition of the NI reduced the respective emissions by 95, 83 and 24% over the 16 d incubation period. These results suggest that N stabilizers can play a significant role in the mitigation of the environmental impacts of intensive agriculture, and, in particular, that the UI amendment may have the better potential to reduce N losses in the climatic and soil conditions of the NCP, and that the NI should be avoided under high ambient temperatures.

Optimized fertigation mitigates N2O and NO emissions and enhances NH3 volatilizations in an intensified greenhouse vegetable system br. Gaseous reactive nitrogen (GNr) losses (N2O, NO emissions and NH3 volatilization, etc.) in greenhouse vegetable fields (GVF) have received considerable critical attention. Much uncertainty still exists about GNr losses reduction under increasing vegetables demand and environmental policies in China. An experiment spanning four greenhouse vegetable growing seasons (cucumber and tomato) was conducted in North China Plain (NCP). It included four treatments, i.e., flood irrigation with no urea-N application (FU0), flood irrigation with conventional urea-N application (FUN), drip fertigation with conventional urea-N application (DUN), and drip fertigation with 50% reduction of urea-N application (DRUN). Obvious emission peaks of N2O, NO and NH3 flux were captured in the GVF after each fertilization and irrigation event. For FUN treatment, the mean annual area-scaled emissions of N2O, NO, and NH3 were 11.48, 1.66, and 44.90 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively; and the mean annual yield-scaled emissions of N2O, NO, and NH3 were 181.86, 23.04, and 800.07 g N t-1 yr- 1, respectively. On the mean annual area-scaled and yield-scaled, the N2O emissions were significantly (P < 0.05) lower by 40.1 % and 32.3 %, and the NO emissions were lower by 23.5 % and 28.5 %, but the NH3 volatilization were significantly (P < 0.05) higher by 31.7 % and 49.0 %, respectively, for the DUN treatment than FUN. Also compared with FUN, in DRUN treatment, the mean annual area-scaled N2O emissions, NO emissions and NH3 volatilization were significantly reduced by 46.7 %, 52.4 % and 22.0 %, respectively; and the mean annual yield-scaled N2O emissions, NO emissions and NH3 volatilization were significantly reduced by 40.7 %, 57.1 % and 24.5 %, respectively. Moreover, compared with FUN treatment, DUN and DRUN treatment both alleviated the global temperature potential (GTP) at 20- and 100-year timescales. Overall, compared with conventional water and fertilizer regimes, only changing irrigation mode reduced N2O and NO emissions but increased NH3 volatilization losses in greenhouse cucumber-tomato cultivation system; reducing N application while changing irrigation methods had significant emission reduction effects on N2O, NO and NH3 at both the area-scaled and yield-scaled, and which is an effective water and fertilizer managements for greenhouse cucumber-tomato cultivation system.

Four-year continuous residual effects of biochar application to a sandy loam soil on crop yield and N2O and NO emissions under maize-wheat rotation. Biochar application has been reported to effectively mitigate N2O emissions and increase crop yield; however, its long-term residual effects remain largely unknown. A four-year field experiment was designed in the North China Plain (NCP) to evaluate the residual effect of biochar on N2O and NO emissions and crop yield under maize-wheat rotation. The study included five treatments: no N fertilization (Control), N fertilizer application (CN), and N fertilizer plus maize-straw biochar application at 3 (NB3), 6 (NB6) and 12 t ha(-1) (NB12). Biochar amendment had no effect on maize yield during the four-year rotation, but increased maize grain N uptake by 12.9 - 14.1 % and fertilizer N use efficiency by 13.8 % in the fourth year. Meanwhile, NB12 treatment decreased wheat yield by 11.7 - 15.5 % in each year, except the second, while decreased average wheat yield. Biochar application significantly reduced N2O emissions by 31.5 - 42.4 % during the first maize season, and by 6.9 - 21.3 % in the third and fourth years primarily due to reduction in NH4+ availability for nitrification. Furthermore, this mitigation effect was positively related to soil moisture content and decreased with time after biochar application. Cumulative N2O emissions during the four wheat seasons were 0.25 - 0.85 kg N2O-N ha(-1), and only decreased by 8.9 - 9.9 % under biochar amendment in the third and fourth years probably because low soil temperature suppressed N2O production. Biochar addition in the third and fourth years significantly reduced NO emissions by 9.0 - 20.1 % during the maize growing seasons and 10.5 - 19.1 % during the wheat growing seasons, especially under NB6 treatment. The average yield-scaled N2O and NO emissions were lowest in the NB6 treatment during the maize and wheat season. Overall, these findings suggest that 6 t ha(-1) is the optimal biochar application rate for reducing N2O/NO emissions and yield-scaled N2O/NO emission under four-year maize-wheat rotation in the NCP.

Gaseous losses of fertilizer nitrogen from a citrus orchard in the red soil hilly region of Southeast China. The gaseous losses of fertilizer nitrogen (N) applied to agroecosystems are a major contributor to a host of environmental problems, inefficient production systems, and decreased N-use efficiency. These losses lead to the wastage of resources, increasing the greenhouse effect and harming human health. The red soil hilly region of Southeast China houses the biggest orchard area of the world, and nitrogen fertilizers are usually heavily applied to the orchard systems in China. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the gaseous losses of the fertilizer N by ammonia (NH3) volatilization and denitrification losses using the venting method and acetylene inhibition method respectively, and to assess the potential environmental risk of NH3 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from this orchard system based on the recent orchard management practices. An experiment was conducted in an Ougan citrus (Citrus reticulata Blanco 'Suavissima') orchard in the red soil hilly region of Southeast China. Three fertilization treatments, including the control (no N fertilizer, CK), poultry manure (at a rate of 6.3 t/ha, OM), and conventional fertilization (OM 6.3 t/ha + chemical fertilizer 393 kg N/ha, CF), were used. In all treatments, the fertilizers were incorporated into the soil after application. The test results, which were continuously determined within one year, indicated that the NH3 volatilization losses accounted for 4.5% of the OM nitrogen (OM-N) and 2.9% of the CF nitrogen (CF-N), whereas the denitrification N losses accounted for 2.1% of the OM-N and 2.9% of the CF-N. Overall, the total gaseous N losses (including NH3 volatilization losses and denitrification N losses) were 5.8% in the CF treatment. A relatively higher N2O flux, accounting for 1.8% of the CF-N, emitted from the CF treatment.

Balancing high yields and low N2O emissions from greenhouse vegetable fields with large water and fertilizer input: a case study of multiple-year irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer regimes. Background and aims Greenhouse vegetable production is commonly associated with substantial nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, low nitrogen (N)and irrigation water use efficiency (NUE and IWUE) due to excess N input and frequent flooding irrigation, so it is crucial to develop irrigation and fertilization strategies to alleviate N2O emissions while ensuring vegetable productivity. Methods An experiment spanning three crop rotations of cucumber and celery in a greenhouse was conducted in North China Plain (NCP). It included four treatments, i.e., no N fertilizer (CK), farmers' conventional fertilization (FP), conventional fertilization rate with drip fertigation (FPD), and reduced N fertilizer rate with drip fertigation (RFPD). Results The mean annual area-scaled, yield-scaled N2O emissions and direct N2O emission factors (EFd) of FP were 36 kg N ha(-1), 175 g N t(-1) and 1.3%, respectively. FPD significantly reduced N2O emissions by over 25% (both in area- and yield-scaled), enhanced IWUE by 37%, and had no significant negative effects on vegetable yield or NUE. RFPD also significantly mitigated both area- and yield-scaled N2O emissions by about 45%, improved IWUE by 40% and NUE by 25%, while maintaining vegetable yield. Quadratic curves were fitted to the boundary points of ln-transformed N2O emissions against soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS), with the maximum N2O losses occurring at 19.5 celcius or 68%. N2O emissions responded to IWUE and NUEs following an exponential (R-2 = 0.71, P < 0.001) and a linear-plateau model (R-2 = 0.67, P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions Drip irrigation with reduced N fertilizer rate is a suitable agronomic practice to simultaneously mitigate N2O emissions and improve both IWUE and NUE while maintaining vegetable yield from typical greenhouse cucumber-celery fields in NCP.

Optimized irrigation management mitigates reactive nitrogen loss and shapes nitrogen fate in wheat production. Context: Optimized irrigation management plays a pivotal role in wheat production in the North China Plain (NCP). However, there exists limited research on the potential impact of different irrigation regimes on the loss of reactive nitrogen (Nr) and the fate of nitrogen (N) within the wheat-soil system. Objective: Our study involved an irrigation experiment aimed at quantifying nitrogen-reducing (Nr) while tracing the N fate. Our primary objective was to glean insights into improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and reducing N surplus, thereby enhancing crop yields and minimizing environmental risks. Methods: A two-year field experiment involving winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted in the NCP, employing four distinct irrigation management strategies: I0, pre-planting irrigation; I1, pre-planting + jointing irrigation; I2, pre-planting + anthesis irrigation; I3, pre-planting + jointing + anthesis irrigation. Throughout the wheat growth stages, we measured soil NH3 and N2O emissions alongside yield assessments. The Nr loss, N surplus, NUE and Nr footprint were evaluated. Results: Among the components contributing to Nr loss, ammonia (NH3) volatilization was the most significant, accounting for 53.1-58.9%, followed by nitrate (NO3-) leaching (18.9-23.2%), indirect Nr loss (10.9-12.7%), nitric oxide (NO) emission (4.90-6.02%), nitrous oxide (N2O) emission (2.52-3.55%), and ammonium (NH4+) leaching (2.10-2.58%). NH3 emission and Nr loss demonstrated a close association with soil moisture levels influenced by irrigation management. Across all treatments, the primary fate of the N input was N uptake, representing 42.7-59.4%, and N surplus, accounting for 28.4-46.0%. Furthermore, NH3 volatilization, as the leading contributor to total N loss (11.4-12.9% of N input), accounted for 5.70-6.80% of N input. Compared to over-irrigation (I3), the I1 treatment, characterized by supplemental irrigation during the jointing stage, exhibited a remarkable 29.0% (P < 0.05) reduction in N surplus, achieved a higher NUE of 59.4%, and sustained wheat yield, thereby minimizing the Nr footprint. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage effectively mitigates Nr loss and shapes the N fate, resulting in both high NUE and increased wheat yields, while simultaneously reducing the Nr footprint.

NITROUS AND NITRIC-OXIDE EMISSIONS DURING NITRIFICATION AND DENITRIFICATION FROM MANURE-AMENDED SOIL IN THE LABORATORY. Denitrification and nitrification processes in soil produce significant amounts of atmospheric N2O and NO. Laboratory experiments were designed to measure N2O and NO emissions from an agricultural soil shortly after manure addition. Nitrous oxide emissions were higher from soil following addition of manure slurries than following addition of composted manure. Emissions of both N2O arid NO were highest between 1 and 4 d after manure addition. Nitrous oxide emission following manure application was the result of both denitrification and nitrification, which occurred simultaneously in soil. Denitrification was a major producer of N2O because both denitrification rates and N2O emission increased dramatically at higher soil-moisture contents and increased manure concentration. Nitric oxide production occurred during nitrification. Nitrous oxide emitted during the 6 d after manure addition ranged from 0.025 to 0.85% of the manure N. Nitric oxide emissions were approximately 0.26% of the amount of added manure N. C1 UNIV GUELPH,DEPT LAND RESOURCE SCI,GUELPH N1G 2W1,ONTARIO,CANADA.

FLUXES OF NITRIC AND NITROUS OXIDES FROM AGRICULTURAL SOILS IN A COOL TEMPERATE CLIMATE. Fluxes of NO and N2O from sandy loam soils cropped with winter wheat and a clay loam soil under ryegrass, with and without the addition of NH4NO3 fertilizer, were measured using static and dynamic chamber methods. Nitric oxide fluxes ranged from -0.3 (deposition) to 6.9 (emission) ng NO-N m-2s-1. The corresponding N2O flux ranged from 0 to 91 (emission) ng N2O-N m-2 s-1. The NO flux was temperature dependent. Activation energies ranged from 40 to 81 kJ mol-1. Nitric oxide and N2O fluxes increased linearly with soil available nitrogen (NH4+NO3). Emissions of NO and N2O were not detectable from unfertilized ryegrass plots. Instead, nitric oxide was absorbed by the soil and vegetation at a maximum rate of 0.31 ng NO-N m-2 s-1. The aeration state of the soil controlled the relative rates of NO and N2O emission. Nitric oxide was the major gas emitted from well aerated soils, conditions that favour nitrification. The NO/N2O emission ratio was > 100 for the coarse-textured sandy loam soil and the clay loam soil only during low rainfall periods. Nitrous oxide was the major gas emitted from less aerated soils, conditions that allowed denitrification to occur. The NO/N2O emission ratio was < 0.001 for the clay loam soil when rainfall was high and soils were wet. Extrapolation to the U.K. situation showed that agricultural land may account for 2-6% of the total annual NOx emission and for 16-64% of the total annual N2O emission in the U.K. C1 EDINBURGH SCH AGR, EDINBURGH EH9 3JG, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND.

In recent years several studies have shown that N2O emissions from organic soils can be high at low temperatures. However, the effects of low temperature on NO emissions from soil are unknown. We studied in laboratory conditions, using undisturbed soil cores, the emissions of NO and N2O from organic soils at various temperatures, with an emphasis on processes and emissions during soil freezing and thawing periods. We found no soil freezing- or thawing-related emission maxima for NO, while the N2O emissions were higher both during soil freezing and thawing periods. The results suggest that different factors are involved in the regulation of NO and N2O emissions at low temperatures. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Biogenic nitric oxide from wastewater land application. The importance of municipal wastewater land application to nitric oxide production and transport in soil was studied through the formulation and conduct of a comprehensive laboratory testing protocol. Nitric oxide (NO) is a precursor in the formation of tropospheric ozone which can directly impact public health and the environment. It is the uncertainty in the NO budget, and its relation to O-3, that motivates the need for measurements and modeling of NO flux from soils. Wastewater-amended soil is potentially one important component of that budget. NO emissions reported here were measured from: a well-characterized unamended soil, water-amended soil, and wastewater-amended soil in the laboratory in a dynamic test chamber. Laboratory results indicate that NO emissions from the selected sandy loam soil ranged from 0.3 to 0.4 ng N m(-2) s(-1) per cm(2) of unamended soil, while water-amended soil emissions ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) per cm(2).

Data-driven estimation of nitric oxide emissions from global soils based on dominant vegetation covers. Soils are a major source of global nitric oxide (NO) emissions. However, estimates of soil NO emissions have large uncertainties due to limited observations and multifactorial impacts. Here, we mapped global soil NO emissions, integrating 1356 in-situ NO observations from globally distributed sites with high-resolution climate, soil, and management practice data. We then calculated global and national total NO budgets and revealed the contributions of cropland, grassland, and forest to global soil NO emissions at the national level. The results showed that soil NO emissions were explained mainly by N input, water input and soil pH. Total above-soil NO emissions of the three vegetation cover types were 9.4 Tg N year(-1) in 2014, including 5.9 Tg N year(-1) (1.04, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.09-1.99 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) emitted from forest, 1.7 Tg N year(-1) (0.68, 95% CI: 0.10-1.26 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) from grassland, and 1.8 Tg N year(-1) (0.98, 95% CI: 0.42-1.53 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) from cropland. Soil NO emissions in approximately 57% of 213 countries surveyed were dominated by forests. Our results provide updated inventories of global and national soil NO emissions based on robust data-driven models. These estimates are critical to guiding the mitigation of soil NO emissions and can be used in combination with biogeochemical models.

Processes regulating nitric oxide emissions from soils. Nitric oxide (NO) is a reactive gas that plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry by influencing the production and destruction of ozone and thereby the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. NO also contributes by its oxidation products to the formation of acid rain. The major sources of NO in the atmosphere are anthropogenic emissions (from combustion of fossil fuels) and biogenic emission from soils. NO is both produced and consumed in soils as a result of biotic and abiotic processes. The main processes involved are microbial nitrification and denitrification, and chemodenitrification. Thus, the net result is complex and dependent on several factors such as nitrogen availability, organic matter content, oxygen status, soil moisture, pH and temperature. This paper reviews recent knowledge on processes forming NO in soils and the factors controlling its emission to the atmosphere. Schemes for simulating these processes are described, and the results are discussed with the purpose of scaling up to global emission.

Influence of soil physical properties, fertiliser type and moisture tension on N2O and NO emissions from nearly saturated Japanese upland soils. In Japan, upland soils are an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) gas emissions. This paper reports on an investigation of the effect of soil moisture near saturation on N2O and NO emission rates from four upland soils in Japan of contrasting texture. The aim was to relate these effects to soil physical properties. Intact cores of each soil type were incubated in the laboratory at different moisture tensions after fertilisation with NH4-N, NO3-N or zero N. Emissions of N2O and NO were measured regularly over a 16-20 day period. At the end of the incubation, soil cores were analysed for physical properties. Moisture and N fertiliser significantly affected rates of emissions of both N2O and NO with large differences between the soil types. Nitrous oxide emissions were greatest in the finer-textured soils, whereas NO emissions were greater in the coarser-textured soils. Emissions of N2O increased at higher moisture contents in all soils, but the magnitude of increase was much greater in finer-textured soils. Nitric oxide emissions were only significant in soils fertilised with NH4-N and were negatively correlated with soil moisture. Analysis of soil properties showed that there was a strong relationship between the magnitude of emissions and soil physical properties. The importance of soil wetness to gas emissions was mainly through its influence on soil air-filled porosity, which itself was related to gas diffusivity. From the results of this research, we can now estimate likely effects of soil texture on emissions through the influence of soil type on soil aeration and soil drainage. This is of particular value in modelling N2O and NO emissions from soil moisture status and land use inputs. C1 SAC, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland. NIAES, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan.

Relationship between N2O and NO emission potentials and soil properties in Japanese forest soils. To determine the relationship between nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emission rates and soil properties in forest soils, N2O and NO emission rates in soils were measured in incubation experiments under standardized temperature and water conditions (water content at a water-holding capacity of 60%) using soils packed into a cylindrical core, and variations in the soil properties were also determined. The N2O emission rates from nitrification and from denitrification were determined separately using a nitrification inhibitor (10 Pa acetylene). Soil samples were taken from 25 forest stands in a central temperate area of Japan. The N2O and NO emission rates were highly variable, even under the standardized temperature and water-holding capacity (60%) conditions. According to a partial least squared regression model analysis, the C:N ratio and pH strongly affected the N2O emission rate, whereas NO3, water-soluble Al and the C:N ratio strongly affected the NO emission rate. The C:N ratio negatively affected the emission rate of both N oxide gases, suggesting that N mineralization is an important factor in the rates of N oxide gas emission. The acetylene inhibition experiment showed that N2O emission from denitrification was positively affected by pH, water-filled pore space and filling density, and negatively affected by the C:N ratio, total carbon and total nitrogen.

A European inventory of soil nitric oxide emissions and the effect of these emissions on the photochemical formation of ozone. An inventory of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions for Europe was developed. The emission of NO was parameterized using empirical relationships with type of landuse, fertilization rate of agricultural areas and soil temperature. For the year 1994, it was estimated that annual soil NO emissions in the inventoried area amounted to 535 kt NO-N yr(-1), i.e. 8% of the emissions from combustion processes. On a hot summer day, this fraction increased to 27%. The uncertainty of these emission estimates, however, is high. They are accurate only within a factor of three to four. As the major fraction (in summer 81%) of the emissions came from arable land, soil NO emissions have to be considered as largely anthropogenic. Large regional differences existed in the soil NO emission rates with the highest emission rates found in southern and western Europe, intermediate rates in eastern Europe and the lowest rates in Scandinavia and northern Russia. The effect of the soil NO emissions on the photochemical formation of ozone (O-3) was investigated with a one-dimensional photochemical model. When soil NO emissions were considered in the model simulations, computed mean daily maximum O-3 concentrations over Europe from June to August 1994 were 4 ppb (uncertainty range: 1.4-9.6 ppb) higher than without these emissions. Reductions of pyrogenic NOx emissions were less efficient in reducing O-3 concentrations when soil NO emissions were taken into account. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We used a chronosequence of one forest and six pastures to investigate how soil N availability and soil moisture content affect emissions of N2O and NO. Forest soils had high N availability and large N oxide emissions. Forest conversion to pasture decreased N availability and N oxide emissions. In the forest where N availability was high, seasonal changes in soils moisture led to higher N2O fluxes during the wet season, but higher NO fluxes during the dry season. Soil water content exerted the largest control on N2O emissions, which seemed to be determined by a threshold value of approximately 29-30%, below which N2O emissions were nearly constant and above which they increased (Figure 5a).

Effect of N-fixing and non N-fixing trees and crops on NO and N2O emissions from Senegalese soils. Aim Agroforestry systems incorporating N-fixing trees have been shown to be socially beneficial and are thought to be environmentally friendly, both enriching and stabilizing soil. However, the effect of such systems on the emissions of the important greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and the tropospheric ozone precursor nitric oxide (NO) is largely unknown. Location Soil was collected from the research plots of Institut Senegalais de Recherches Agricoles at Bandia and Bambey, Senegal, West Africa, and from neighbouring farmers' fields. Trace gas flux measurements and chemical analysis of the soil were carried out at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), Edinburgh, UK. Methods Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were measured following simulated rainfall events (10 and 20 mm equivalents) from repacked soil cores collected under two tree species (Acacia raddiana) and Eucalyptus camaldulensis) in each of two provenance trails. In addition, soil samples were collected in local fields growing peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and Sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), close to the species trials in Bambey. NO was measured using a flow through system and was analysed by chemiluminescence. Nitrous oxide was measured from the repacked soil core headspace and was analysed by electron capture gas chromatography. Soil mineral N was extracted with KCl and analysed by colorimetric methods on separate soil columns. Results Light rainfall, which increased the gravimetric soil moisture content to 20%, stimulated an increase in NO emission but there was no detectable N2O emission. A heavy rainfall event, which increased the gravimetric soil moisture to 30%, stimulated N2O emission with a subsequent peak in NO emissions when the soils became drier. Soil collected under the N-fixing tree species emitted significantly more N2O than soil collected under the N-fixing crop species (P < 0.01). NO and N2O emissions significantly correlated with soil available N (NH4 and NO3) (P < 0.05). Main Conclusion Rainfall intensity, supply of mineral N from organic matter and N fixation were the prime drivers of NO and N2O emissions from seasonally dry tropical soils. The improved soil fertility underneath the trees provided a larger pool of mineral N and yielded larger rates of NO and N2O emissions. C1 Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland.

Only 6 studies met the established criteria, resulting in a total of 12 observations of soil/crop/fertilizer combinations, all in temperate areas. For these studies, the amount of NO emitted was linearly related to the amount of fertilizer applied (R-2 = 0.64) and about 0.5% of applied nitrogen was emitted as NO during the crop growing season.

However, their actual impact on ozone formation is strongly related to their spatial and temporal emission patterns, which warrant high-resolution estimates Here, we combined an agro-ecosystem model and geo-referenced databases to map these sources over the 12 000 km(2) administrative region surrounding Paris, France, with a kilometric level resolution The six most frequent arable crop species were simulated, with emission rates ranging from 14 kg N-NO ha(-1) yr(-1) to 11.1 kg N-NO ha(-1) yr(-1). The overall emission factor for fertilizer-cleaved NO emissions was 1.7%, while background emissions contributed half of the total NO efflux.

Wet Spots as Hotspots: Moisture Responses of Nitric and Nitrous Oxide Emissions From Poorly Drained Agricultural Soils. A classic framework for soil nitrogen (N) cycling, the hole in the pipe (HIP) model, posits a trade-off in emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) as a function of soil moisture. This has been incorporated into ecosystem models but not tested experimentally and remains an important uncertainty for understanding potential hotspots of reactive N emissions: poorly drained agricultural soils that experience episodically high moisture following intensive fertilization. We incubated soils at moisture ranging from 44% to 100% water-filled pore space (WFPS). Counter to HIP, we did not observe a consistent trade-off in NO and N2O emissions at intermediate moisture levels following fertilization, and prefertilization emissions were low. Emissions of N as N2O exceeded NO by 2-200-fold at all moisture levels and peaked at 73-82% WFPS. Emissions of NO declined with moisture but remained significant even under saturated conditions. Increases in nitrite and reduced iron at high moisture indicated possible NO production from chemodenitrification. Potential nitrification rates were 100-1,000-fold greater than potential denitrification. Emission factors for fertilizer N ranged from 0.05% to 0.58% (mean=0.2%) for NO and from 0.4% to 16.9% (mean=5.3%) for N2O. Our results caution the use of WFPS to predict NO:N2O emission ratios as often employed in ecosystem models. Subsurface N cycling may suppress emissions of NO relative to N2O, and N2O emissions can persist under saturated conditions. Elevated N2O emissions from in-field wet spots comprising a small landscape extent could potentially address disparities between top-down and bottom-up N2O budgets. Plain Language Summary Nitric oxide and nitrous oxide are environmentally harmful gases: they contribute to climate change, the loss of good ozone high in the atmosphere that protects us from damaging sunlight, and the production of bad ozone that pollutes our air. The activities of microorganisms in soils are important sources of these gases to the atmosphere, and fertilized agricultural soils have particularly high emissions. Conceptual and mathematical models are often used to predict how nitrous and nitric oxide emissions respond to environmental changes and to guide policy and management. Here we tested a key assumption of a classic conceptual model that is widely used to estimate soil nitrous and nitric oxide emissions, using a laboratory experiment with two poorly drained agricultural soils. We found that there was not a clear trade-off in the emissions of nitric versus nitrous oxide as soil moisture varied from low to high levels, in contrast to predictions. Rather, emissions of nitrous oxide were greater than expected, and production of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide persisted under very wet conditions. Poorly drained patches of intensively fertilized agricultural soils could represent important sources of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere. C1 [Hall, S.

Nitric oxide emissions from rice-wheat rotation fields in eastern China: effect of fertilization, soil water content, and crop residue. A better understanding of nitric oxide (NO) emission from a typical rice-wheat agroecosystem in eastern China is important for calculating the regional inventory and to propose effective NO mitigation options. Nitric oxide flux measurements by static chamber method were made from treatments of conventional nitrogen-fertilizer (NPK plus urea) application, no-nitrogen application, and nitrogen-fertilizer with incorporation of wheat straw residue for an entire rotation period (June 2002 to June 2003). During the wheat growing season two further treatments of fertilizer without crops planted and bare soil without nitrogen (N) fertilization were applied. Total annual NO emissions for the conventional fertilizer, no N fertilizer and fertilizer plus straw application were 0.44 +/- 0.01, 0.22 +/- 0.01, and 0.57 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1)y(-1), respectively. On average 27% of this emission occurred during the rice season due to flooding/drainage cycle. The N fertilizer-induced emission factor for the conventional fertilizer treatment was 0.05% of the total N applied. Incorporation of wheat straw in the rice season showed no significant effect on NO flux due to the high C/N ratio of the straw incorporated. During the wheat growing season, NO emissions for all treatments had similar variation pattern controlled by soil moisture dynamics. Total NO emissions in the wheat season for fertilized bare soil (no wheat planted) were 0.389 +/- 0.01 and 0.21 +/- 0.01 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. The results indicate the importance of N fertilizer and soil moisture to nitrogen loss through the formation of NO.

Fluxes of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide from experimental excreta patches in boreal agricultural soil. Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were measured from experimental dung and urine patches placed on boreal pasture soil during two growing seasons and one autumn period until soil freezing. N2O emissions in situ were studied by a static chamber method. NO was measured with a dynamic chamber method using a NO analyser in situ. Mean emissions from the control plots were 47.6 +/- 4.5 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 12.6 +/- 1.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1). N2O and NO emissions from urine plots (132 +/- 21.2 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 51.9 +/- 7.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)) were higher than those from dung plots (110.0 +/- 20.1 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 14.7 +/- 2.1 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)). There was a large temporal variation in N2O and NO emissions. Maximum N2O emissions were measured a few weeks after dung or urine application, whereas the maximum NO emissions were detected the following year. NO was responsible on average 14% (autumn) and 34% (summer) of total (NO + N2O)-N emissions from the pasture soil. NO emissions increased with increasing soil temperature and with decreasing soil moisture. N2O emissions increased with increasing soil moisture, but did not correlate with soil temperature. Therefore we propose that N2O and NO were produced mainly during different microbial processes, i.e., nitrification and denitrification, respectively. The results show that the overall conditions and mechanism especially for emissions of NO are still poorly understood but that there are differences in the mechanisms regulating N2O and NO production.

Photochemical emission and fixation of NOx gases in soils. Gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx), which result from the combustion of fossil fuels, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and biological reactions in soils, not only affect air quality and the atmospheric concentration of ozone, but also contribute to global warming and acid rain. Soil NOx emissions have been largely ascribed to soil microbiological processes; but there is no proof of abiotic catalytic activity affecting soil NO emissions. We provide evidence of gas exchange in soils involving emissions of NOx by photochemical reactions, and their counterpart fixation through photocatalytic reactions under UV-visible irradiation. The catalytic activity promoting NOx capture as nitrate varied widely amongst different soil types, from low in quartzitic sandy soils to high in iron oxide and TiO2 rich soils. Clay soils with significant amounts of smectite also exhibited high rates of NOx sequestration and fixed amounts of N comparable to that of NO (nitric oxide) losses through biotic reactions. In these soils, a flux of 100 mu g N-NO m(-2) h(-1), as usually found in most ecosystems, could be reduced by these photochemical reactions by more than 60%. This mechanism of N fixation provides new insight into the nitrogen cycle and may inspire alternative strategies to reduce NO emissions from soils. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of woody vegetation encroachment on soil nitrogen oxide emissions in a temperate savanna. Woody vegetation has encroached into areas once dominated by herbaceous land cover in and and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States and around the world, resulting in documented changes to the biophysical and biogeochemical structure of these ecosystems during the past century. In North Texas rangelands, encroaching mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa), a known nitrogen (N)-fixing species, has caused changes in aboveground biomass, which, in turn, have influenced carbon (C) and N storage in surface soils. However, the effect on N oxide (nitric-NO and nitrous-N2O oxide) emissions from the soils was unknown. We examined biotic (vegetation type and soil organic and inorganic N dynamics) and abiotic (soil moisture, temperature, and soil texture) controls over soil NO and N2O emissions across a gradient of aboveground Prosopis biomass growing on two soil types. Soil N oxide fluxes were dominated by NO emissions produced during nitrification. Aboveground biomass was the best spatial, predictor of NO emissions, with values increasing 20-fold (0.04-0.78 mg NO-N.m(-2).d(-1)) across a 70-fold biomass gradient (5-350 g/m(2)). Emissions also covaried with soil pH and clay content. Microsite position, under or between the mesquite canopies, did not influence NO emission rates. NO fluxes were four times higher from clay loam than from shallow clay soils; however, soil N properties (total organic N and extractable inorganic N) and cycling rates (mineralization and nitrification). did not differ significantly across the sites. Temporally, NO emissions and nitrification potential were positively correlated with temperature, with precipitation events elevating NO emissions fourfold over a 24-h period and producing small amounts of N2O, We conclude that mesquite encroachment in these grasslands increases NO emissions in a spatially explicit manner influenced by the Aboveground biomass and soil type, which is then temporally mediated primarily by temperature and secondarily by precipitation.

Decreased N2O and NO emissions associated with stimulated denitrification following biochar amendment in subtropical tea plantations. Acidic soils are hotspots of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) and biochar is documented to have the potential for mitigating N2O and NO. The N2O and NO emissions associated with soil functional genes and physicochemical properties under biochar amendment remains unclear in acidic soils. Here, we carried out a two-year field study to examine the responses of soil N2O and NO emissions to biochar amendment in a subtropical tea plantation in China. Measurements of N2O and NO fluxes were taken from inter-row soils using the static chamber method. We also measured the seasonal changes in soil key nitrogen (N)-cycling functional genes and physicochemical properties. Annual N2O and NO emissions averaged 27.31 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 8.75 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the N fertilizer applied plots, which were decreased by 24% and 16% due to biochar application, respectively. In addition, both potential nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDR) rates were stimulated by biochar amendment, which significantly increased the abundances of bacterial amoA (AOB), nirK and nosZ genes. Changes in the composition of the N2O-related microbial functional community were closely associated with soil PNR, pH, DOC, and NO3--N contents. The ratios of NO/N2O were mainly lower than 1, suggesting that N2O was produced mostly through denitrification rather than nitrification. There were negative correlations between soil N2O and NO emissions and soil PDR and pH, and soil N2O emissions were negatively correlated with nosZ gene abundances. Together, the decrease in N2O and NO emissions following biochar application could be largely attributed to the enhanced denitrification process, in which biochar enriched the nirK and nosZ genes abundance, resulting from the enhancement of soil DOC and pH in acidic soils.

STUDIES ON NO AND N2O FLUXES FROM A WHEAT FIELD. The importance of soil parameters and the other environmental conditions that affect emission rates of NO and N2O were studied over a fertilised wheat field. Open-chamber and closed-chamber techniques were used for the flux measurement of NO and N2O, respectively. Both gases showed variation in the emission rates which followed the seasonal variation in the available HN4+ and NO3- and the moisture content of the soil. Whilst N2O emission rates increased with the moisture content of the soil, NO emissions decreased with increasing soil moisture and rainfall. The results suggested that most soil variables and atmospheric parameters had similar effects on both NO and N2O emission rates but that the overriding influence upon the NO/N2O emission ratio is the soil moisture content. The NO flux showed a clear diurnal variation which followed the surface soil temperature with an activation energy of 108 kJ mol(-1). The annual NO flux estimated from this study (0.79 kg N ha(-1)) was approximately half the corresponding N2O (1.42 kg N ha(-1)).

Effects of phosphorus addition on N2O and NO emissions from soils of an Acacia mangium plantation. An incubation experiment was conducted to examine the effects of the phosphorus (P) application on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from soils of an Acacia mangium plantation in Indonesia. The soils were incubated with and without the addition of P (Ca[H2PO4](2); 2 mg P g soil-1) after adjusting the water-filled pore space (WFPS) to 75% or 100%. The P addition increased N2O emissions under both WFPS conditions and NO emissions at 75% WFPS. Some possible mechanisms are considered. First, the P addition stimulated nitrogen (N) cycling, and N used for nitrification and/or denitrification also increased. Second, the P addition could have relieved the P shortage for nitrifying and/or denitrifying bacteria, producing N2O and NO. Our results suggest that the application of P fertilizer has the potential to stimulate N2O and NO emissions from Acacia mangium plantations, at least when soils are under relatively wet conditions.

Regional estimate of nitric oxide emissions following woody encroachment: Linking imaging spectroscopy and field studies. Woody encroachment, a spatially explicit process of land-cover change, is known to affect the biophysical and biogeochemical properties of ecosystems. However, little information is available on the impacts of woody encroachment on N oxide emissions from savanna regions. We combined hyperspectral remote sensing and field measurements to quantify spatial patterns and estimate regional fluxes of soil N oxide emissions as they covary with vegetation cover and soil type across a semiarid rangeland in north Texas. Soil nitric oxide ( NO) emissions were highly correlated with Prosopis canopy cover, allowing the extrapolation of NO fluxes from hyperspectral observations of woody cover. NO emissions were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 550 kg NO-N km(-2) y(-1) across the region, with the lowest emissions from shallow clay soils and highest from deeper upland clay loams. An estimate of annual NO emissions based on remotely derived Prosopis cover, temperature, and precipitation was 160 kg NO-N km(-2) y(-1), almost twice that of the value derived from traditional averaging of field measurements. We conclude that relationships between NO emissions and remotely sensed structure and composition are advantageous for quantifying NO emissions at the regional scale. This study also provides new insight into the role of woody encroachment on biogeochemical processes that are highly variable and otherwise difficult to measure at the regional scale.

Annual nitric and nitrous oxide emissions response to biochar amendment from an intensive greenhouse vegetable system in southeast China. Biochar impact on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from intensive greenhouse vegetable cropping systems is not well established. Annual soil N2O and NO emissions were simultaneously measured from a typical greenhouse vegetable field treated with different biochar application rates in southeast China. Both N2O and NO emissions differed greatly across the individual vegetable cropping seasons, of which being higher in green soybean and tomato growing seasons, respectively. Over the annual vegetable cropping rotation, biochar amendment decreased soil N2O and NO emissions by 10-23% and 18-19% relative to N fertilization alone, respectively. Biochar rate of 20 t ha(-1) gained the lowest N2O and NO emissions over the annual cycle. The ratio of NO/N2O was negatively correlated with soil moisture and depends on biochar addition or not. On average, annual emission factor (EF) of N2O and NO combined was accounted for 2.13% with biochar amendment, which was decreased by 22% compared with N fertilization alone (EF = 2.74%). Vegetable yield was significantly enhanced under the biochar combined with N fertilizer plots relative to control, while there is no difference among the N fertilization treatments with or without biochar amendment. Therefore, biochar could be used as an effective management mitigating soil N2O and NO emissions while maintaining crop yield in greenhouse vegetable cropping systems in southeast China.

Greenhouse gas emissions from European soils under different land use: effects of soil moisture and temperature. In order to estimate potential greenhouse gas flux rates from soils under different land use and climate, and to particularly assess the influence of soil temperature and soil moisture, we measured fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from intact soil cores obtained from 13 European sites under controlled laboratory conditions. The soils covered the different climates of Europe and included four different land-use types: croplands, forests, grasslands and wetlands. In a two-factorial experimental design, the soil cores were incubated under four temperatures (5-20 degrees C) and water contents (20-80% water-filled pore space). We found a non-linear increase of N2O, NO and CO2 emissions with increasing temperature. Nitrous oxide emissions were positively correlated with soil moisture, while NO emission and CH4 oxidation rates were negatively correlated with soil moisture. Maximum CO2 emissions occurred at intermediate soil moisture. Different land-use types strongly affected greenhouse gas fluxes. Nitrous oxide and CO2 emissions were highest in grassland soils, while NO emissions were highest in forest soils. In grasslands, high soil microbial activity stimulated by high carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents, dense root systems and high C input from above-ground decaying biomass was the most likely cause for high N2O and CO2 emissions. High NO emissions from forest soils were mainly attributed to low pH and high soil porosity. Northern soils showed the greatest capacity to take up CH4 under warmer and dryer soil conditions. Nitric oxide emissions were positively correlated with N input.

Influence of soil moisture on the seasonality of nitric oxide emissions from chaparral soils, Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions are variable in both space and time, and are important pathways for N loss in seasonally dry ecosystems that undergo abrupt transitions from dry-to-wet soil conditions. We measured soil NO emissions from a chaparral catchment to characterize seasonal variability of, and triggers for enhanced NO losses. Pulses in NO emissions were observed in the summer and autumn when dry soils (soil water content (theta) < 6%) were wetted naturally and artificially (range: 97-513 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1)). The rapidity and magnitude of these pulses suggest that abiotic processes may influence NO emissions. Outside of the observed pulses, NO emissions were highest during the dry season (theta < 6%; dry season mean = 3.4 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1)) and lowest during the winter wet season (theta> 20%; wet season mean = 0.14 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1)). These observed seasonal patterns contrast with previous DAYCENT simulations of NO emissions in our catchment, which predicted higher NO emissions during the wet season. Our field observations are consistent with sustained rates of nitrification, reduced plant N uptake, and high soil gas diffusivity observed during the dry season in arid environments.

Greater nitrous and nitric oxide emissions from the soil between rows than under the canopy in subtropical tea plantations. Subtropical agricultural soils are hotspots of nitrogen(N)-oxide emissions, whereas the spatiotemporal variability and driving factors of their emissions in different cultivation systems are poorly understood. Here, to assess the magnitude and pattern of soil N-oxide emissions, we conducted measurements of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from the soil between rows and under the canopy of tea plants in two subtropical tea plantations over a one-year period. Results showed that N2O and NO emissions from the soil between rows were 32.6 and 9.1 kg N ha(-1) for the Yixing (YX) site and 33.9 and 9.9 kg N ha 1 for the Jurong (JR) site, respectively. Across both sites, N2O and NO emissions from the soil between rows were 2.8-5.2 and 1.4-4.0 times, respectively, larger than those from the soil under the canopy. We attributed greater N-oxide emissions from the soil between rows mainly to increased soil mineral N and water contents as compared to the soil under the canopy. On average, N2O and NO emissions from the soil under the canopy accounted for 36% and 44% of the total losses from the entire field, respectively. For the entire tea field, N2O emissions were 12.6 and 15.7 kg N ha(-1) for the YX and JR sites, respectively, but the difference was not statistically different. In contrast, NO emissions from the YX and JR sites were 3.8 and 5.7 kg N ha(-1) and differed significantly between the two sites, which was due to higher NO emissions from the soil under the canopy in the JR site. The greatest N-oxide fluxes occurred in the spring and summer seasons after topdressing when soil conditions were conducive to microbial N-oxide production. The structural equation modeling analyses suggested that the variables explaining the variances of soil N-oxide emissions were different between the two tea plantations. Our results indicated that microbial nitrification and abiotic chemodenitrification processes were likely the major pathways leading to N-oxide emissions in the soil under the canopy. Our findings highlight the importance of N-oxide fluxes simultaneously taken from the soil between rows and under the canopy and implementing mitigation practices in subtropical tea plantations.

Gas concentrations were measured using an nondispersive infrared (gas filter correlation/infra-red) analyzer and a chemiluminescence-based analyzer, respectively. Following a basal application of fertilizer, daily N2O and NO emission rates increased, with peaks lasting from 40 to 140 days. Short-term fluctuations in daily N2O and NO emissions were affected by differences in nitrogen application, soil water, and soil temperature. Diurnal changes in N2O and NO fluxes during the period of peak emissions depended primarily on soil temperature. Following the application of a top dressing (N as urea or calcium nitrate) in the irrigation water, the N2O and NO fluxes increased immediately, with a very short period of peak emissions (1-5 h) after urea application. The duration of the peak period in daily accumulated N2O and NO emissions following application of the top dressing ranged from 3 to 10 days. C1 Natl Inst Vegetable & Tea Sci, Aichi 4702351, Japan.

Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a freely drained sandy loam, fertilized with (NH4)2SO4 or KNO3 (100 kg N ha-1) with or without the addition of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD), were measured. The addition of N fertilizers increased emissions of NO and N2O. For plots fertilized with (NH4)2SO4, NO emissions increased from 2.4 to 46.9 ng NO-N m-2 s-1 (2.1-40.5 g NO-N ha-1 day-1), in the first 7 days after fertilizer application. Nitrous oxide emission rates were considerably lower, ranging from 0.95 to 7.4 ng N2O-N m-2 s-1 (0.82-6.4 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1). Nitrification rather than denitrification was the source of the NO emitted from the soil; additions of DCD inhibited the emissions by at least 92%. Nitrous oxide, on the other hand, was a product of both nitrification and denitrification. When soils were dry, N2O was produced predominantly by nitrification and DCD reduced emissions by at least 40%. In contrast, in wet conditions denitrification was the main source of N2O and emissions were not inhibited by DCD. Nitric oxide emissions correlated significantly with soil temperature (30 mm depth), the air temperature inside the chamber, soil available NH4+, and were significantly reduced by watering the soil. Apparent activation energies, calculated from the temperature response in the NO emission rates, ranged from 30 to 71 kJ mol-1. It was concluded from the close links between air temperature in the chamber and the NO emission rates that the NO was produced very close to the soil surface. During nitrification the rate of depletion of NH4+-N emitted as NO-N was 5.5 x 10(-5) s-1. It was estimated that for cultivated fields 0.15-0.75% of the applied NH4+ fertilizer is released as NO.

Emissions of N2O and NO from fertilized fields: Summary of available measurement data - art. no. 1058. Information from 846 N2O emission measurements in agricultural fields and 99 measurements for NO emissions was summarized to assess the influence of various factors regulating emissions from mineral soils. The data indicate that there is a strong increase of both N2O and NO emissions accompanying N application rates, and soils with high organic-C content show higher emissions than less fertile soils. A fine soil texture, restricted drainage, and neutral to slightly acidic conditions favor N2O emission, while (though not significant) a good soil drainage, coarse texture, and neutral soil reaction favor NO emission. Fertilizer type and crop type are important factors for N2O but not for NO, while the fertilizer application mode has a significant influence on NO only. Regarding the measurements, longer measurement periods yield more of the fertilization effect on N2O and NO emissions, and intensive measurements (greater than or equal to1 per day) yield lower emissions than less intensive measurements (2-3 per week). The available data can be used to develop simple models based on the major regulating factors which describe the spatial variability of emissions of N2O and NO with less uncertainty than emission factor approaches based on country N inputs, as currently used in national emission inventories.

Agricultural soils are important sources of the tropospheric ozone precursor NO and the greenhouse gas N2O. Emissions are controlled primarily by parameters that vary the soil mineral N supply, temperature and soil aeration. In this field experiment, the importance of soil physical properties on emissions of NO and N2O are identified. Fluxes were measured from 13 soils which belonged to 11 different soil series, ranging from poorly drained silty clay loams to freely drained sandy loams. All soils were under the same soil management regime and crop type (winter barley) and in the same maritime climate zone. Despite this, emissions of NO and N2O ranged over two orders of magnitude on all three measurement occasions, in spring before and after fertilizer application, and in autumn after harvest. NO emissions ranged from 0.3 to 215 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1), with maximum emissions always from the most sandy, freely drained soil. Nitrous oxide emissions ranged from 0 to 193 mug N2O-N m(-2) h(-1). Seasonal shifts in soil aeration caused maximum N2O emissions to switch from freely drained sandy soils in spring to imperfectly drained soils with high clay contents in autumn. Although effects of soil type on emissions were not consistent, N2O emission was best related to a combination of bulk density and clay content and the NO/N2O ratio decreased logarithmically with increasing water filled pore space.

Synergistically mitigating nitric oxide emission by co-applications of biochar and nitrification inhibitor in a tropical agricultural soil. Agricultural soils are the hotspots of nitric oxide (NO) emissions, which are related to atmospheric pollution and greenhouse effect. Biochar application has been recommended as an important countermeasure, however, its mitigation efficiency is limited as biochar, under certain conditions, can stimulate soil nitrification. Therefore, biochar co-applied with nitrification inhibitor could optimize the mitigation potential of biochar. Herein, a laboratory-scale experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of co-application of biochar and nitrification inhibitor on NO emission, nitrogen cycling function and bacterial community in a tropical vegetable soil. Results showed that a single application of biochar or nitrification inhibitor significantly decreased NO emissions, and this mitigation effectiveness was amplified by their co-applications. Soil NO2--N intensity, along with abun-dances of AOB-amoA and nirK were significantly and positively correlated with cumulative NO emissions. The stimulated activity of ammonia monooxygenase and growths of AOB and total comammox Nitrospira by biochar were weakened by nitrification inhibitor, implying decreased nitrification-driven NO production. The nitric oxide reductase activity and related qnorB abundance in nitrification inhibitor-added soils were increased by biochar, indicating promoted NO consumption during denitrification. The nirK abundance and NO2--N intensity were decreased more by co-applications of biochar or nitrification inhibitor. Moreover, both biochar and nitri-fication inhibitor changed bacterial beta-diversity, and their co-application synergistically enriched Armatimona-detes and Verrucomicrobia abundances and decreased WPS-2 abundance. This study highlights that co -applications of biochar and nitrification inhibitor can make their respective advantages complementary to each other, thereby achieving a larger mitigation of NO emissions from agricultural soils in tropical regions.

Average soil emissions of NO were 1.2 and 2.1 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), and for N2O were 15 and 20 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), for spruce and oak soils, respectively. Due to the relatively high soil water content, and low C/N ratio in soil, denitrification processes dominate, resulting in an order of magnitude greater N2O emission rate compared to NO. The previously determined N balance between the atmosphere and the forest ecosystem was re-calculated using these soil emission figures. The total (dry + wet) atmospheric N-deposition to the soil was 1.42 and 1.59 g N m(-2) yr(-1) for spruce and oak, respectively, while the soil emissions are 0.14 and 0.20 g N m(-2) yr(-1). Thus, about 10-13% of N compounds deposited to the soil, mostly as NH3/NH4+ and HNO3/NO3- were transformed in the soil and emitted back to the atmosphere, mostly as greenhouse gas (N2O).

Elevated ozone mitigates warming-induced N2O and NO emissions in an intensified wheat field. Global warming and elevated tropospheric ozone (O3) regulate the fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) in wheat-rice fields. However, their combined effects on N2O and NO emissions in an intensified wheat fields remain underexplored. Here, a three-year field study was conducted to assess the effects of elevated O3 and warming on nitrogen oxide emissions and clarify key influencing factors within a free-air O3 concentration elevation and warming system. Results showed that, on average, elevated O3 significantly inhibited N2O (-16.4 %) and NO (-34.6 %) emissions from wheat fields at ambient temperature across years. Conversely, warming increased N2O (+19.0 %) and NO (+67.4 %) emissions, especially after fertilization and during the late period of wheat growth. Compared to warming, combined treatment of elevated O3 and warming significantly reduced N2O (-17.8 %) and NO (-32.7 %) emissions. The effects of elevated O3 and warming on N2O emission were related to significant changes in soil NH4+ , NO3- , and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content but not to soil microbial biomass nitrogen, or pH. Warming also stimulated N2O emissions by reducing soil moisture and increasing temperature. The effect of elevated O3 on soil NO emissions was mainly related to soil DOC and pH. Warming mainly stimulated NO emissions by increasing soil temperature and soil DOC and reducing soil moisture. Our results indicate that the inhibitory effect of high O3 concentration needs to be incorporated into global change models for cropland nitrogen oxide emissions.

Spatial variations in nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emission potential on a slope of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) forest. To quantify the spatial variation and spatial structure of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emission from forest soils, we measured N2O and NO emission rates from surface soil cores taken at 1 m intervals on a cross-line transect (65 m x 20 m) on a slope of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) forest in a temperate region of central Japan and analyzed the spatial dependency of N oxide gas emissions using geostatistics. We divided N2O emission into N2O from denitrification and N2O from nitrification using the acetylene inhibition method. According to the geostatistical analysis, N2O emission rates on the slope had large spatial variation and weak spatial dependency. This weak spatial dependency was caused by the inordinately high N2O emissions on the slope, which were derived mainly from denitrification. In contrast, NO emission rate on the slope had large spatial variation, but strong spatial dependency and a distinct spatial distribution related to slope position, that is, high in the middle of the slope and low in the shoulder and the foot of the slope. The CN ratio and water-filled pore space were the dominant factors controlling NO emission rate on a slope. Our results suggest that spatial information about topographic factors helps to improve the estimation of both N2O emission and NO emission from forest soils.

The effect of nitrification inhibitor on N2O, NO and N2 emissions under different soil moisture levels in a permanent grassland soil. Emissions of gaseous forms of nitrogen from soil, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), have shown great impact on global warming and atmospheric chemistry. Although in soil both nitrification and denitrification could cause N2O and NO emissions, most studies demonstrated that denitrification is the dominant process responsible for the increase of atmospheric N2O, while nitrification produces mostly NO. The use of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) has repeatedly been shown to reduce both N2O and NO emissions from agricultural soils; nevertheless, the efficiency of the mitigation effect varies greatly. It is generally assumed that nitrification inhibitors have no direct effect on denitrification. However, the indirect impact, due to the reduced substrate (nitrate) delivery to microsites where denitrification occurs, may have significant effects on denitrification product stoichiometry that may significantly lower soil borne N2O emissions. Soil-water status is considered to have a remarkable effect on the relative fluxes of nitrogen gases. The effect and mechanism of NI on N2O, NO and N-2 emission under different soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) is still not well explored. In the present study, we conducted a soil incubation experiment in an automated continuous-flow incubation system under a He/O-2 atmosphere. Ammonium sulfate was applied with and without NI (DMPP) to a permanent UK grassland soil under three different soil moisture conditions (50, 65, and 80% WFPS). With every treatment, glucose was applied to supply enough available carbon for denitrification. Emissions of CO2, N2O, NO and N-2 were investigated. Additionally, isotopic signatures of soil-emitted N2O were analyzed. Generally, higher WFPS led to higher N2O and NO emissions, while N-2 emissions were only detected at high soil moisture condition (80% WFPS). Different processes were responsible for N2O and NO emission in different phases of the incubation period. The application of DMPP did significantly reduce both N2O and NO emissions at all three soil moisture conditions. Furthermore, DMPP application increased N-2 emissions and decreased the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio at 80% WFPS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The influence of soluble carbon and fertilizer nitrogen on nitric oxide and nitrous oxide emissions from two contrasting agricultural soils. Contradictory effects of simultaneous available organic C and N sources on nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes are reported in the literature. in order to clarify this controversy, laboratory experiments were conduced on two different soils, a semiarid arable soil from Spain (soil 1, pH = 7.5 0.8%C) and a grassland soil from Scotland (soil 11, pH = 5.5 4.1 %C). Soils were incubated at two different moisture contents, at a water filled pore space (WFPS) of 90% and 40%. Ammonium sulphate, added at rates equivalent to 200 and 50 kg N ha(-1), stimulated N2O and NO emissions in both soils. Under wet conditions (90% WFPS), at high and low rates of N additions, cumulative NO emissions increased by 250.7 and 8.1 ng N2O-Ng(-1) in comparison to the control, respectively,. in soil I and by 472.2 and 2.1 ng N2O-Ng(-1), respectively,in soil II. NO emissions only significantly increased in soil I at the high N application rate with and without glucose addition and at both 40% and 90% WHIS. In both soils additions of glucose together with the high N application rate (200 kg N ha(-1)) reduced Cumulative N2O and NO emissions by 94% and 55% in soil I. and by 46% and 66% in soil 11, respectively. These differences can be explained by differences in soil properties, including pH, soil mineral N and total and dissolved organic carbon content. It is speculated that nitrifier denitrification was the main source of NO and N2O in the C-poor Spanish soil, and coupled nitrification-denitrification in the C-rich Scottish soil.

Afforestation of semi-arid shrubland reduces biogenic NO emission from soil. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a central role in the formation of tropospheric ozone, hydroxyl radicals, as well as nitrous and nitric acids. There are, however, large uncertainties around estimates of global NO emissions due to the paucity of data. In particular, there is little information on the rate of NO emission and its sensitivity to processes such as land use changes in dry environments. Here we report on a two-year study on the influence of afforestation on soil NO fluxes in the semi-arid afforestation system in Southern Israel (Yatir forest, mean annual precipitation similar to 280 mm). Laboratory incubations were carried out under seasonally defined conditions of soil moisture and temperature using soils sampled in different seasons from the native shrubland (taken both under shrub canopy and in the inter-shrub areas), and from the adjacent similar to 2800 ha, 40-year-old pine afforestation site. Combining laboratory results with field measurements of soil moisture and temperature, we up-scaled soil-atmosphere NO fluxes to the ecosystem level. The different microsites differed in their annual mean NO release rates (0.04, 0.14 and 0.03 mg m(-2) d(-1) for the shrubland under and between shrubs and for the forest, respectively), and exhibited high inter-seasonal variability in NO emission rates (ranging from zero up to 0.25 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the wet and dry-rewetting seasons, respectively), as well as in temperature responses. Up-scaling results to annual and ecosystem scales indicated that afforestation of the semi-arid shrubland could reduce soil NO emission by up to 65%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nitric oxide emissions from soils: a case study with temperate soils from Saxony, Germany. Nitrogen oxides (NO (x) ) are involved in acid rain and ozone formation, as well as destruction. NO (x) are climate-relevant trace gases in the atmosphere. Atmospheric NO (x) originate from anthropogenic emissions (mainly combustion processes). NO from natural processes derives from thunderstorms and soil microbial processes. They may play a crucial role in soil-atmosphere feedback processes. This study aims to investigate NO (x) -emissions from soils under different land use, geographical and meteorological conditions. NO (x) -emissions were quantified in both field and laboratory experiments with a closed static chamber. Disturbed soil samples have been used for laboratory experiments. A climate chamber was used to regulate soil temperature of the samples. Field experiments showed that NO-soil emissions strongly depend on soil temperature. NO-emissions from a soil under meadow showed significant daily variations, unlike soil below spruce forest. Peak emission values were 18 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) above meadow and 1.3 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) under forest canopy. In addition, NO-emissions of meadow and forest soil were studied in a climate chamber, enhanced by an additional experiment with agricultural soil. These experiments revealed strong exponential correlations of NO-emissions and soil temperature. Maximum values reached above 400 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) from agricultural soils at soil temperatures above 50A degrees C. This study shows that soil NO-emissions strongly depend on temperature, vegetation type and geographical position. Consequently, NO-emissions may have a positive feedback effect on climate change.

Nitric oxide emissions from black soil, northeastern China: A laboratory study revealing significantly lower rates than hitherto reported. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important component of biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen, produced via biologically mediated processes of nitrification and denitrification in soils. The production and consumption processes of NO in black soils are not fully understood. We established how moisture and temperature affect NO dynamics for black soil samples of maize land in the temperate zone of northeastern China. The optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO production and emission was determined to be 41% water-filled pore space (WFPS), based on laboratory experiments and modeling. For a given moisture, NO fluxes increased exponentially with soil temperature at any given soil moisture. The optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO emission was constant and independent of soil temperature. The NO consumption rate constant (k) in the studied soil (range 9.31 x 10(-6)-15.1 x 10(-6) m(3) kg(-1) s(-1)) was in the middle of the range of similar k values published to date. The maximum NO emission potential for black soils at 25 degrees C and 15 degrees C were about 18.6 and 9.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Based on laboratory results and field monitoring data of soil water content and soil temperature, the average NO fluxes from black soils in the region were estimated to be 10.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for an entire plant growth period. NO emissions likely occur principally in July, associated with optimum soil moisture. The present study suggests that NO fluxes from black soil are much lower than the previous reports from cropland in southern parts of China. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A meta-analysis of fertilizer-induced soil NO and combined NO+N2O emissions. Soils are among the important sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), acting as a critical role in atmospheric chemistry. Updated data derived from 114 peerreviewed publications with 520 field measurements were synthesized using metaanalysis procedure to examine the N fertilizerinduced soil NO and the combined NO+N2O emissions across global soils. Besides factors identified in earlier reviews, additional factors responsible for NO fluxes were fertilizer type, soil C/N ratio, crop residue incorporation, tillage, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, drought and biomass burning. When averaged across all measurements, soil NON fluxes were estimated to be 4.06 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), with the greatest (9.75 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) in vegetable croplands and the lowest (0.11 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) in rice paddies. Soil NO emissions were more enhanced by synthetic N fertilizer (+38%), relative to organic (+20%) or mixed N (+18%) sources. Compared with synthetic N fertilizer alone, synthetic N fertilizer combined with nitrification inhibitors substantially reduced soil NO emissions by 81%. The global mean direct emission factors of N fertilizer for NO (EFNO) and combined NO+N2O (EFc) were estimated to be 1.16% and 2.58%, with 95% confidence intervals of 0.711.61% and 1.813.35%, respectively. Forests had the greatest EFNO (2.39%). Within the croplands, the EFNO (1.71%) and EFc (4.13%) were the greatest in vegetable cropping fields. Among different chemical N fertilizer varieties, ammonium nitrate had the greatest EFNO (2.93%) and EFc (5.97%). Some options such as organic instead of synthetic N fertilizer, decreasing N fertilizer input rate, nitrification inhibitor and low irrigation frequency could be adopted to mitigate soil NO emissions. More field measurements over multiyears are highly needed to minimize the estimate uncertainties and mitigate soil NO emissions, particularly in forests and vegetable croplands.

Evaluation of nitrate and ammonium as sources of NO and N2O emissions from black earth soils (Haplic Chernozem) based on 15N field experiments. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) released from soil is a concern since it can act as a potential atmospheric pollutant and it represents a loss of N from the soil. These gases are present in the atmosphere in trace amounts and are important to atmospheric chemistry and earth's radiative balance. Nitric oxide (NO) does not directly contribute to the greenhouse effect, but it contributes to climate forcing through its role in photochemistry of hydroxyl radicals and ozone and plays a key role in air quality issues. Nitrification and denitrification have been identified as major controlling microbial processes in soils responsible for the formation of NO and N2O. To elucidate the contribution of both processes to the release of NO and N2O from loess-black earth soils under field conditions-i.e. to evaluate nitrate and ammonium as sources of NO and N2O emission-two field experiments with either [N-15] nitrate (NO3-) or [N-15] ammonium (NH4+) labelling have been conducted at two sites differing in soil organic matter content (high and normal SOM). [N-15] nitrate treatments revealed that denitrification of NO3- represents the main pathway of soil N2O release. On average 76% and 54% of N2O was emitted during denitrification from soils with high and normal SOM content, respectively. Contrarily, denitrification contributed on average only 17% and 12% of released NO from soil with high and normal SOM content, respectively. The [N-15]ammonium treatments revealed that nitrification of NH4+ is the major process responsible for soil NO emission. SOM content of the loess-black earth soil significantly influenced NO and N2O emission. The soil with the higher SOM content showed lower NO emission but drastically increased N2O emission after nitrate fertilisation. In particular the soil with high SOM content exhibited a high sorption capacity for ammonium ions which led to unexpected results after fertilisation with [N-15]ammonium. To explain this results a revised concept containing three different interacting soil ammonium pools have been hypothesised. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Denitrification as a source of nitric oxide emissions from incubated soil cores from a UK grassland soil. Agricultural soils are a major source of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which are produced and consumed by biotic and abiotic soil processes. The dominant sources of NO and N2O are microbial nitrification and denitrification. While N2O emissions have been attributed to both processes, depending on the environmental conditions such as substrate availability, pH and water filled pore space (WFPS), NO emissions are thought to predominantly derive from nitrification. Although attributing gaseous emissions to specific processes is still difficult, recent findings challenge the latter of those assumptions. Using the gas-flow-soil-core method, i.e soil cores incubated under a He/O-2 atmosphere at constant surface gas flow, combined with N-15 labelled isotopic techniques, the present study investigated the role of denitrification on NO, N2O and N-2 emissions in a UK grassland soil under high soil moisture and an aerobic headspace atmosphere. With the application of KNO3 and glucose to support denitrification, denitrification was the source of N loss of between 0.61 and 0.67% of the added N via NO emissions, 1.60-1.68% via N2O and 0.03-0.05% via N-2 emissions. Overall, our study showed that denitrification has been overlooked as a source of NO emissions. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of conversion of natural grassland to cropland on nitric oxide emissions from Venezuelan savanna soils.: A four-year monitoring study. Conversion of \"natural\" savanna to agricultural soil is proceeding at a very fast rate. In this work, nitric oxide (NO) emissions were measured immediately after conversion of a \"natural\" grassland to fertilized agricultural fields (corn, sorghum and cultivated pasture), and also during the second and fourth year after conversion. Large fluxes were observed after plowing grassland soil, and almost no difference was observed between ammonium-fertilized and unfertilized plowed grassland soils. Soil water content and pH related negatively to NO emissions. NO emissions were positively correlated with soil nitrate concentrations and carbon content (corn only) whereas little or no correlation was found with ammonium concentrations. This suggests that in these savanna soils, the NO emitted from soil is mainly denitrification-derived. The disturbed soils emitted on average similar to 7 times more NO than the original grassland. During the second and fourth year of cultivation the emissions from corn and sorghum fields (plowed every year) were around 10 times higher than from the control grassland soils. The fertilizer-induced emission (FEI) values for NO emission estimated in this work show that similar agricultural practices could lead to dramatically different FEI values depending on the water content of the soils. These FEI results corroborates that modeling approaches to determine the global agriculture-derived NO emissions should take into consideration the main factors that regulate the NO emission at the scale of functional units with similar climate, soil and management conditions instead of expressing it as a percentage of the fertilizer applied. In our sandy loam savanna soils these factors are inorganic nitrogen content, pH and WFPS. C1 Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Atmospher Chem Lab, Caracas 1020A, Venezuela.

Aridity and plant uptake interact to make dryland soils hotspots for nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important trace gas and regulator of atmospheric photochemistry. Theory suggests moist soils optimize NO emissions, whereas wet or dry soils constrain them. In drylands, however, NO emissions can be greatest in dry soils and when dry soils are rewet. To understand how aridity and vegetation interact to generate this pattern, we measured NO fluxes in a California grassland, where wemanipulated vegetation cover and the length of the dry season and measured [delta(15)-N]NO and [delta(18)-O] NO following rewetting with N-15-labeled substrates. Plant N uptake reduced NO emissions by limiting N availability. In the absence of plants, soil N pools increased and NO emissions more than doubled. In dry soils, NO-producing substrates concentrated in hydrologically disconnected microsites. Upon rewetting, these concentrated N pools underwent rapid abiotic reaction, producing large NO pulses. Biological processes did not substantially contribute to the initial NO pulse but governed NO emissions within 24 h postwetting. Plants acted as an N sink, limiting NO emissions under optimal soil moisture. When soils were dry, however, the shutdown in plant N uptake, along with the activation of chemical mechanisms and the resuscitation of soil microbial processes upon rewetting, governed N loss. Aridity and vegetation interact to maintain a leaky N cycle during periods when plant N uptake is low, and hydrologically disconnected soils favor both microbial and abiotic NO-producing mechanisms. Under increasing rates of atmospheric N deposition and intensifying droughts, NO gas evasion may become an increasingly important pathway for ecosystem N loss in drylands.

The relative importance of the rain-stimulated emissions in the seasonal and annual budgets of these nitrogen gases for forests and pastures in the western Amazon is not well established. We measured soil emissions of NO and N2O from a forest and two pastures, 11 and 26 years old, after a simulated rain event. Wetting the soil resulted in very small pulses of NO or N2O from forest soils and no significant NO or N2O pulses from the pastures. We estimated that in the forest, the amounts of each gas emitted from pulses during the dry to wet transition period represented 3.4% of the NO and 1.8% of the N2O dry-season emissions, but amounted to less than 2% of the annual emissions of either gas. Total N oxide emissions of 5.6 kg N/ha/yr from the forest were nearly evenly divided between NO (42%) and N2O (58%). The emissions of NO were evenly distributed over the wet and dry seasons, while over 84% N2O fluxes occurred during the wet season. C1 Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.

Diurnal changes in nitric oxide emissions from conventional tillage and pasture sites in the Amazon Basin: influence of soil temperature. We have investigated a subset of restoration practices applied to a degraded pasture at Fazenda Nova Vida, a 22 000 ha cattle ranch in Rondonia, Brazil. Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from soils were measured in conventional tillage and current pasture sites to assess N and C losses. Mean daily NO emissions from tilled plots were at least twice those from the pasture. Nitric oxide emissions from the tilled sites showed a strong diurnal pattern, while those from the pasture sites did not. Mean daytime NO emissions from the tilled sites were 9.7 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1), while mean nighttime emissions were 29.7 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1). In the pasture sites, NO emissions were 7.6 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1) during the day, and 7.7 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1) at night. Surface soil temperature was a good inverse predictor (r(2) = 0.75) of NO emissions from the tilled sites. Carbon dioxide emissions from the tilled sites were generally larger than CO2 emissions from the pasture sites. The mean CO2 emission rate from the tilled sites was 179 mg C m(-2) h(-1), while it was 123 mg C m(-2) h(-1) from the pasture sites. There was no distinct diurnal pattern for CO2 emissions. We found that the very high temperatures measured at the soil surface in the tillage plots, in the range of 40 - 45 degreesC, reduced the rate of NO emission. The reduction in NO emissions may be because of the sensitivity of autotrophic nitrifiers to high temperatures. This study provides insights on how land-use change may alter regional NO fluxes by exposing certain microbial communities to extreme environmental conditions. Future studies of NO emissions in tropical agricultural systems where soils are bare for extend periods need to make diurnal measurements or the daily fluxes will be substantially underestimated.

Effects of the depth of NO and N2O productions in soil on their emission rates to the atmosphere:: analysis by a simulation model. Many factors are concerned in the changing forms of nitrogen compounds in soil, so it is not easy to make precise models to simulate the concentration profiles of soil nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and their emission rates under various soil conditions. We prepared a simple mathematical simulation model based on soil concentration profiles of NO and N2O. The profiles were measured at lysimeters filled with Andosol soil and fertilized with ammonium sulfate at rate of 200 kgNha(-1), incorporating to plow layer (Hirose & Tsuruta, 1996). In this model, diffusion of gases in soil followed Fick's law and the diffusion coefficient was adopted from Sallam et al. (1984). The gas production rate was set up at constant value in the site of gas production, and the gaseous consumption followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. By changing only the depth of NO and N2O production in soil in this model, we obtained the following results. (1) When the depth of gas production was set at near the soil surface (NO: 0-10 cm, N2O: 0-8 cm), the emission rates of both gases corresponded with the results of the lysimeter-measurement. (2) When the depth of gas production was shifted down 10 cm deeper (NO: 10-20 cm, N2O: 10-18 cm), the gas emission rate of NO decreased to 1.3% of (1), while that of N2O was almost the same as (1). (3) In the case that the total intensity of produced gases was not changed from (1) or (2), but that the extent of gas productions expanded 3 times wider (NO: 0-30 cm, N2O: 0-24 cm) than (1) or (2), the emission rates of NO and N2O became 26% and 95% of (1), respectively. The above results suggest the possibility of mitigating NO emission by setting the site of gaseous production in deeper soil, e.g. by means of deep application of fertilizer.

Water-filled pore space is confirmed to be of critical importance to NO flux, and the upper layers of soil are determined to contribute the larger portion of the NO fluxing from the soil to the troposphere. More than 42% of the total NO flux comes from the top 1 cm of soil, with NO contributions decreasing exponentially with soil depth and very little if any tropospheric NO contributed from soil at a depth of 20 cm or greater.

The impact of atmospheric N deposition and N fertilizer type on soil nitric oxide and nitrous oxide fluxes from agricultural and forest Eutric Regosols. Agricultural and forest soils with low organic C content and high alkalinity were studied over 17 days to investigate the potential response of the atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO) and the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) on (1) increased N deposition rates to forest soil; (2) different fertilizer types to agricultural soil and (3) a simulated rain event to forest and agricultural soils. Cumulative forest soil NO emissions (148-350 ng NO-N g(-1)) were similar to 4 times larger than N2O emissions (37-69 ng N2O-N g(-1)). Contrary, agricultural soil NO emissions (21-376 ng NO-N g(-1)) were similar to 16 times smaller than N2O emissions (45-8491 ng N2O-N g(-1)). Increasing N deposition rates 10 fold to 30 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), doubled soil NO emissions and NO(3)(-)concentrations. As such high N deposition rates are not atypical in China, more attention should be paid on forest soil NO research. Comparing the fertilizers urea, ammonium nitrate, and urea coated with the urease inhibitor 'Agrotain (R),' demonstrated that the inhibitor significantly reduced NO and N2O emissions. This is an unintended, not well-known benefit, because the primary function of Agrotain (R) is to reduce emissions of the atmospheric pollutant ammonia. Simulating a climate change event, a large rainfall after drought, increased soil NO and N2O emissions from both agricultural and forest soils. Such pulses of emissions can contribute significantly to annual NO and N2O emissions, but currently do not receive adequate attention amongst the measurement and modeling communities.

Effects of deep application of urea on NO and N2O emissions from an Andisol. A modeling study revealed that the depth of nitric oxide (NO) production in soil is crucial for its flux, while that of nitrous oxide (N2O) is not. To verify this result, laboratory experiments with soil columns classified as Andisol (Hydric Hapludand) were conducted, with changing the depth of urea application, at 0-0.1 or 0.1-0.2 m. All the NO concentration profiles in soil exhibited a sharp peak at each fertilized layer within 5 days of fertilizer application. NO concentration in soil decreased abruptly as the distance from the fertilized layer increased. These findings imply that NO is produced mainly within the fertilized layer, but does not diffuse widely in the soil columns, because of rapid NO uptake within the soil. As a result, the NO flux from soil columns fertilized at 0.1-0.2 m depth over the 48-day study period was reduced to almost the same rate as that of the unfertilized one. The total NO emissions from soil columns unfertilized and fertilized at 0-0.1 and 0.1-0.2 m depth were 0.02, 1.39 (+/- 0.05) and 0.05 (+/- 0.03) kg N ha(-1), respectively, suggesting that NO emission derived from N fertilizer could be reduced to 2% by shifting the depth of fertilizer application by 0.1 m. On the other hand, soil N2O concentration profiles exhibited a gentler peak, because of the lower uptake by soil. N2O fluxes were affected more by the soil conditions, e. g. soil water content, than the distance between fertilized depth and soil surface. The total N2O emissions from soil columns unfertilized and fertilized at 0-0.1 and 0.1-0.2 m were 0.02, 0.16 (+/- 0.03) and 0.25 (+/- 0.04) kg N ha(-1), respectively.

N2O and NO emission from agricultural fields and soils under natural vegetation:: summarizing available measurement data and modeling of global annual emissions. The number of published N2O and NO emissions measurements is increasing steadily, providing additional information about driving factors of these emissions and allowing an improvement of statistical N-emission models. We summarized information from 1008 N2O and 189 NO emission measurements for agricultural fields, and 207 N2O and 210 NO measurements for soils under natural vegetation. The factors that significantly influence agricultural N2O emissions were N application rate, crop type, fertilizer type, soil organic C content, soil pH and texture, and those for NO emissions include N application rate, soil N content and climate. Compared to an earlier analysis the 20% increase in the number of N2O measurements for agriculture did not yield more insight or reduced uncertainty, because the representation of environmental and management conditions in agro-ecosystems did not improve, while for NO emissions the additional measurements in agricultural systems did yield a considerable improvement. N2O emissions from soils under natural vegetation are significantly influenced by vegetation type, soil organic C content, soil pH, bulk density and drainage, while vegetation type and soil C content are major factors for NO emissions. Statistical models of these factors were used to calculate global annual emissions from fertilized cropland (3.3 Tg N2O-N and 1.4 Tg NO-N) and grassland (0.8 Tg N2O-N and 0.4 Tg NO-N). Global emissions were not calculated for soils under natural vegetation due to lack of data for many vegetation types. C1 Univ Gesamthsch Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.

Nitric oxide emission from a typical vegetable field in the Pearl River Delta, China.

In this study, NO fluxes were measured in a typical vegetable field planted with flowering Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. Chinensis var. utilis Tsen et Lee), which is the most widely cultivated vegetable in Guangdong province, south China. NO emission drastically increased after nitrogen fertilizer application, and other practices involving loosening the soil also enhanced NO emission. Mean NO emission flux was 47.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1) over a complete growth cycle. Annual NO emission from the vegetable field was about 10.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Fertilizer-induced NO emission factor was estimated to be 2.4%. Total NO emission from vegetable fields in Guangdong province was roughly estimated to be 11.7GgNyr(-1) based on the vegetable field area and annual No emission rate, and to bel 13.3GgNyr(-1) based on fertilizer-induced NO emission factor and background NO emission. This means that NO emission from vegetable fields was approximately 6% of NOx from commercial energy consumption in Guangdong province. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Impacts of burning on soil trace gas fluxes in two wooded savanna sites in Burkina Faso. In this study, we report the impacts woodland savanna burning has on the soil trace gas fluxes in seasonally dry woodland savannas in Burkina Faso. We measured nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes at two ongoing long-term experimental sites (Tiogo and Dinderesso), each included three fire-exclusion plots and four annually burnt plots (0.24-0.25 ha plot size). We measured soil trace gas fluxes using chamber methods before and after fire during the dry season and at the start of and during the wet season. There was considerable volatilization of aboveground biomass C and N during fire, but soil N2O, NO, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were not significantly influenced following fire events. Instead, soil moisture dynamics were more important in regulating soil CO2 and N2O emissions. The onset of the wet season induced a short-term pulse of N2O emissions, when water-filled pore space exceeded 60%. We also detected a short-term pulse of NO emissions, lasting only four hours, following fire. The low soil N-oxide fluxes reflected the sites' extremely low inorganic N levels in the soil.

Cold season soil NO fluxes from a temperate forest: drivers and contribution to annual budgets. Soils, and here specifically acidic forest soils exposed to high rates of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, are a significant source for the secondary greenhouse gas nitric oxide (NO). However, as flux estimates are mainly based on measurements during the vegetation period, annual NO emissions budgets may hold uncertainty as cold season soil NO fluxes have rarely been quantified. Here we analyzed cold season soil NO fluxes and potential environmental drivers on the basis of the most extensive database on forest soil NO fluxes obtained at the Hoglwald Forest, Germany, spanning the years 1994 to 2010. On average, the cold season (daily average air temperature < 3 degrees C) contributed to 22% of the annual soil NO budget, varying from 13% to 41% between individual cold seasons. Temperature was the main controlling factor of the cold season NO fluxes, whereas during freeze-thaw cycles soil moisture availability determined NO emission rates. The importance of cold season soil NO fluxes for annual NO fluxes depended positively on the length of the cold season, but responded negatively to frost events. Snow cover did not significantly affect cold season soil NO fluxes. Cold season NO fluxes significantly correlated with cold season soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. During freeze-thaw periods strong positive correlations between NO and N2O fluxes were observed, though stimulation of NO fluxes by freeze-thaw was by far less pronounced as compared to N2O. Except for freeze-thaw periods NO fluxes significantly exceeded those for N2O during the cold season period. We conclude that in temperate forest ecosystems cold season NO emissions can contribute substantially to the annual NO budget and this contribution is significantly higher in years with long lasting but mild (less frost events) cold seasons.

Photocatalytic nitrogen-oxide conversion in red soil. Gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced by biological reactions in the soil not only affects air quality and atmospheric ozone concentration but also cause global warming and acid rain. Soil NOx emissions mainly come from soil microbial processes, but there is little evidence that the photocatalytic activities of inorganic minerals in the soil would affect the NOx transformation. This work studied the effect of soil types, red soil particle sizes, application of urea, and the organic matter content on the NO degradation efficiency and NO2 production, demonstrated that NOx exchange in soils by photochemical reactions and the degradation activity of NO varied widely amongst different soil types. The red soil has an obvious photocatalytic oxidation effect on 1 ppm NO in the air (removal efficiency reaches 24%), and the selectivity for ion species is close to 100%. Soil oxidizes extraneous NO under visible light, it can also oxidize the intrinsic nitrogen-containing compounds into NO2 to contribute emissions in the atmosphere. The ferric oxide could be important for the color of red soil, but its mixture with other minerals is more important for photocatalysis. This nitrogen conversion mechanism provides an alternative pathway for soil NO2 emissions and a new perspective for the nitrogen cycle. C1 [Gan, Yue; Abdellatif, Hassan R.

High resolution measurements reveal abiotic and biotic mechanisms of elevated nitric oxide emission after wetting dry soil. Wetting dry soil triggers emission of nitric oxide (NO), which can harm air quality and influence ecosystem N balance. NO released after wetting may be derived from two primary mechanisms: (1) abiotic decomposition of nitrite (NO2-) present in the dry soil and (2) biologically-mediated production of NO. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to NO emission are challenging to partition. To differentiate the two mechanisms, we made continuous observations of NO emission from a range of soils that varied in texture, pH, and exchangeable cations. We coupled NO gas exchange measurements with automated, non-destructive high-resolution sampling of inorganic N species via microdialysis. We identified two distinct phases of NO production (1) an initial phase that reached its maximum less than 30 min after rewetting; and (2) a second phase lasting up to 36 h. The magnitude of the initial phase of NO production was correlated with the initial nitrous acid concentration (calculated from NO2- concentrations and soil pH) and soil exchangeable calcium. The second phase of NO emission coincided with a peak in NO2- that preceded NO3- accumulation. Together, these results suggest that NO emissions following wetting are defined by an initial pulse of abiotic NO formation mediated by soil acidity at mineral surfaces, followed by a prolonged pulse of NO emission driven by a lag between the biological processes of ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation. These results can inform mechanistic models of NO emissions from soils to improve predictions of the terrestrial N cycle and atmospheric chemistry.

In addition, soil samples were collected from these two sites, and laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the NO production and consumption rate constants as functions of soil temperature and soil moisture. These laboratory results were converted into NO fluxes using a simple algorithm, which required additional information on the gas diffusion in soil, the soil bulk density, and the field conditions (soil temperature and soil moisture). Over the entire measurement period, the calculated and measured NO fluxes agreed well both for the forest (6.9 +/- 2.9 and 5.0 +/- 4.6 ng m(-2) s(-1), respectively) and for the pasture (0.67 +/- 0.09 and 0.65 +/- 0.37 ng m(-2) s(-1), respectively).

Nitrogen oxide emissions and soil microbial activities in a Japanese andisol as affected by N-fertilizer management. This experiment was conducted in maize field plots to study the effects of N-fertilizer management on nitrogen oxide emissions, soil microbial activities and crop yield, and the relationships among them in a Japanese Andisol. N fertilization increased both nitrification and dehydrogenase activities in soil and the emissions of NO and NO. Nitrification and dehydrogenase activities showed a close relationship with the NO emission, while the relationship with the N2O emission was not significant. Deep application (8 cm) of N fertilizer generally decreased both nitrification activity and NO emission. Controlled release of N fertilizer decreased the dehydrogenase activity and up to 86% of the NO emission. Our findings indicate the possibility that the low biological NO production in soil by deep application and controlled release of N fertilizer contributed to the low NO emission. Application of controlled release N fertilizer significantly increased the grain yield and N uptake by grain. NO emission showed a negative relationship with maize yield as affected by N-fertilizer management, suggesting the possibility of mitigating NO emission from Andisols without reducing crop production.

Effect of Conventional Nitrogen Fertilization on Methane Uptake by and Emissions of Nitrous Oxide and Nitric Oxide from a Typical Cropland During a Maize Growing Season. Conventional nitrogen fertilization in a maize cropping system enhances the soil's methane (CH4) sink but exacerbates emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). This study demonstrates that conventional nitrogen application (UN) increased CH4 uptake by 154%, while elevating N2O and NO emissions by 190% and 301%, respectively, compared to zero nitrogen plots (N0). Fertilization fundamentally reconfigured the regulatory mechanisms governing gas fluxes: under UN, fluxes were controlled by a complex interplay of nitrogen substrates, carbon availability, moisture, and temperature, whereas under N0, CH4 uptake exhibited significantly enhanced temperature sensitivity (with Q10 increasing from 1.06 to 7.54) and nitrogen oxide emissions became more dependent on native ammonium and extractable organic carbon. Crucially, nitrogen withdrawal reduced soil ammonium by 37.1% without altering non-nitrogen soil properties, including temperature, moisture, and labile carbon pools. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the concept of nitrogen saturation under conventional fertilization rates. Optimizing these rates presents a significant opportunity to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution while improving nitrogen use efficiency, thereby aligning agricultural production with climate goals and public health objectives without destabilizing short-term soil function.

Regulation of N2O and NOx emission patterns in six acid temperate beech forest soils by soil gas diffusivity, N turnover, and atmospheric NOx concentrations. Low gas diffusivity of the litter layer is held responsible for high seasonal nitrous oxide (N2O) and low nitric oxide (NO) emissions from acid beech forest soils with moder type humus. The objectives were (i) to evaluate whether these beech forest soils generally exhibit high seasonal N2O emissions and (ii) to assess the influence of gas diffusivity and nitrogen (N) mineralisation on N oxide fluxes. We measured N2O and NOx (NO + NO2) fluxes in six German beech stands and determined net N turnover rates and gas diffusivity of soil samples taken at each chamber. High N2O emissions (up to 113 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) were only observed at one beech stand. Net nitrification of the organic layer and soil gas diffusivity explained 77 % of the variation in N2O fluxes (P = 0.001). Fluxes of NOx were low (-6.3 to 12.3 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and appeared to be controlled by NOx concentrations in the forest air. Low soil gas diffusivity and high N turnover rates promoted high N2O losses in times of high soil respiration but were not necessarily associated with moder type humus. High seasonal emissions are probably less common in German beech forests than previously assumed. C1 [Eickenscheidt, Nadine; Brumme, Rainer] Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.

The flux was calculated based on hourly measurements of the NO soil-atmosphere concentration gradient using the one-dimensional soil diffusion model of Galbally and Johansson (1989). The soil bulk diffusion coefficient was determined from measurements of the Rn-222 surface flux and the activity gradient between 10 cm depth and the surface. It ranged between 79% and 0.3% of the NO diffusion coefficient in air and was parameterised by air filled soil pore space. The indirectly determined NO flux agreed well with standard flux measurements using dynamic chambers. The largest NO emission was found following fertiliser application and irrigation. The emission occurred in pulses, which lasted for 4 days up to 3 weeks coinciding with elevated soil ammonium concentrations. Nitric oxide emission in 5 days following application of cattle slurry were 31 g NO-N ha(-)1 and 5 g NO-N ha(-1) from the non-fertilised plot, respectively. Nitric oxide emission in 15 days following application of NH4NO3 was 95 g NO-N ha(-1) and 10 g NO-N ha(-1) from the non-fertilised plot, respectively. NO emission in 4 days following irrigation on 21 April were 36 g N ha(-1) from the fertilised and 39 g N ha(-1) from the non-fertilised plot. The daily NO emission before and after fertiliser and irrigation pulses was between 0.3 and 0.7 g NO-N ha(-1) d(-1). NO production and NO uptake of the soil was measured regularly. No systematic influence of management or climate on NO uptake was found. NO production was strongly stimulated by fertiliser input and soil moisture content. The simulation of NO production could be reproduced using a nitrification algorithm (Riedo et al., 1998) driven by soil temperature, moisture and ammonium concentration. A NO production rate constant of 1.1.10(-3) h(-1) at 15 degrees C was derived from a linear regression between nitrification and NO production. Introducing the parameterisation of NO production into the model of Galbally and Johansson (1989) the duration and the strength of the NO emission pulses could be reproduced and the total NO emission during the experiment was approximated within a factor of two.

Enhanced representation of soil NO emissions in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model version 5.0.2. Modeling of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions is highly uncertain and may misrepresent its spatial and temporal distribution. This study builds upon a recently introduced parameterization to improve the timing and spatial distribution of soil NO emission estimates in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The parameterization considers soil parameters, meteorology, land use, and mineral nitrogen (N) availability to estimate NO emissions. We incorporate daily year-specific fertilizer data from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agricultural model to replace the annual generic data of the initial parameterization, and use a 12 km resolution soil biome map over the continental USA. CMAQ modeling for July 2011 shows slight differences in model performance in simulating fine particulate matter and ozone from Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) and Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) sites and NO2 columns from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite retrievals. We also simulate how the change in soil NO emissions scheme affects the expected O-3 response to projected emissions reductions.

Annual nitric and nitrous oxide fluxes from Chinese subtropical plastic greenhouse and conventional vegetable cultivations. As intensive vegetable cultivation is rapidly expanding in China and elsewhere worldwide, its environmental consequences on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions deserve attention. We measured N2O and NO fluxes simultaneously for a full year from Chinese subtropical vegetable fields. Clearly, both N2O and NO emissions varied greatly in different vegetable crop seasons within a year, highlighting the importance of whole-year measurement for achieving temporally accurate annual direct emission factors. A revised \"hole-in-the-pipe\" model well described quantitative relationships between N2O plus NO fluxes and soil-specific conditions. Annual background N2O and NO emissions were 0.73-5.0 and 0.26-0.56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, for the vegetable cultivations. The farmers' fertilization practice increased N2O and NO emissions. Annual direct emission factors for greenhouse and conventional vegetable fields, respectively, were 1.1% and 1.9% for N2O, and 0.36% and 0.32% for NO, indicating there is a need to consider a differentiation of emission factors for managed vegetable cultivations.

Nitrous Acid and Nitric Oxide Emissions from Agricultural Soils in Guangdong Province: Laboratory Measurement and Emission Estimation. Soil is recognized as an important source of atmospherically reactive gases, especially in agricultural soils. Nonetheless, there is scarcity of research estimating reactive nitrogen gas (Nr) emissions from agricultural soils at the regional to global scale. In this study, we examined nitrous acid (HONO) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from seven representative agricultural soils in Guangdong Province, considering soil moisture and temperature, using a dynamic chamber system. Accordingly, empirical formulas for HONO and NO emissions for each soil in relation to moisture and temperature were developed. Utilizing these empirical formulas, specific land data, and fertilizer data, we estimated the annual HONO and NO emission fluxes from agricultural soils in Guangdong Province to be 97.41 and 37.08 Gg N yr(-1), respectively. Their total quantity is equivalent to 12% of the 2017 NOx emission inventory for Guangdong Province, potentially exerting significant impacts on the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and regional air quality.

Rates and controls of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions following conversion of forest to pasture in Rondonia. Tropical soils are important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from the Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. Clearing of tropical rainforest for pasture has the potential to alter N2O and NO emissions from soils by altering moisture, nitrogen supply or other factors that control N oxide production. In this review we report annual rates of N2O and NO emissions from forest and pastures of different ages in the western Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia and examine how forest clearing alters the major controls of N oxide production. Forests had annual N2O emissions of 1.7 to 4.3 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and annual NO emissions of 1.4 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). Young pastures of 1-3 years old had higher N2O emissions than the original forest (3.1-5.1 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) but older pastures of 6 years or more had lower emissions (0.1 to 0.4 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Both soil moisture and indices of soil N cycling were relatively poor predictors of N2O, NO and combined N2O + NO emissions. In forest, high N2O emissions occurred at soil moistures above 30% water-filled pore space, while NO emissions occurred at all measured soil moistures (18-43%). In pastures, low N availability led to low N2O and NO emissions across the entire range of soil moistures. Based on these patterns and results of field fertilization experiments, we concluded that: (1) nitrification was the source of NO from forest soils, (2) denitrification was not a major source of N2O production from forest soils or was not limited by NO3- supply, (3) denitrification was a major source of N2O production from pasture soils but only when NO3- was available, and (4) nitrification was not a major source of NO production in pasture soils. Pulse wettings after prolonged dry periods increased N2O and NO emissions for only short periods and not enough to appreciably affect annual emission rates. We project that Basin-wide, the effect of clearing for pasture in the future will be a small reduction in total N2O emissions if the extensive pastures of the Amazon continue to be managed in a way similar to current practices. In the future, both N2O and NO fluxes could increase if uses of pastures change to include greater use of N fertilizers or N-fixing crops. Predicting the consequences of these changes for N oxide production will require an understanding of how the processes of nitrification and denitrification interact with soil type and regional moisture regimes to control N2O and NO production from these new anthropogenic N sources.

Effects of soil temperature on nitric oxide emission from a typical Chinese rice-wheat rotation during the non-waterlogged period. Measurements of nitric oxide (NO) emission from a typical Chinese rice-wheat rotation are continuously made during the non-waterlogged period by using an automatic system based on static chamber techniques. A positive correlation exists between NO emission and soil moisture content when surface soil temperature is > 20 degreesC. The diurnal variability in NO emission is characterized with day-peak, night-peak and irregular patterns, which are in close association with wheat growth. The diurnal NO emission under the day-peak pattern is correlated with the simultaneously observed surface soil temperature, whereas that under the night-peak and irregular pattern is dependent on surface soil temperature at 7 +/- 2 and 3 +/- 2 h before NO observation, respectively. The effect of soil temperature on NO emission is well described by F = alpha.e (beta.T), where F is NO flux, T soil temperature, and alpha and beta empirical coefficients. The parameter Q(10); that is, the change in NO emission per 10 degreesC soil temperature, is correlated with the rates of fertilizer-N application. An approach orientated from the Arrhenius equation, F = e(k)e(-Ea/(R.TK)) + e(k)e(-Ea/(R.DeltaTK)) sin[(t-6-tau)/12pi], is developed in order to predict diurnal NO emission, where T(K) is the daily average soil temperature, DeltaT(K) the deviation of soil temperature from the daily average, E(a) the apparent activation energy, R the gas constant, t a given time within the one-day cycle, tau delayed time for appearance of the diurnal NO emission peak, and k an empirical coefficient. Based on the results, the authors recommend that intermittent measurement of NO emission from a similar ecosystem would be best taken around 17:00. The molar ratio of NO/N(2)O over the non-waterlogged period is > 1 when soil moisture content was less than the field capacity, suggesting that NO emission was mainly derived from nitrification under this condition.

N2O and NO emissions from different N sources and under a range of soil water contents. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) have been identified as one of the most important sources of atmospheric pollution from grasslands. Soils are major sources for the production of N2O and NO, which are by-products or intermediate products of microbial nitrification and denitrification processes. Some studies have tried to evaluate the importance of denitrification or nitrification in the formation of N2O or NO but there are few that have considered emissions of both gases as affected by a wide range of different factors. In this study, the importance of a number of factors (soil moisture, fertiliser type and temperature) was determined for N2O and NO emissions. Nitrous oxide and NO evolution in time and the possibility of using the ratio NO:N2O as an indicator for the processes involved were also explored. Dinitrogen (ND and ammonia (NH3) emissions were estimated and a mass balance for N fluxes was performed. Nitrous oxide and NO were produced by nitrification and denitrification in soils fertilised with NH4+ and by denitrification in soils fertilised with NO3-. Water content in the soil was the most important factor affecting N2O and NO emissions. Our N2O and NO data were fitted to quadratic (r = 0.8) and negative exponential (r = 0.7) equations, respectively. A long lag phase was observed for the N2O emitted from soils fertilised with NO3- (denitrification), which was not observed for the soils fertilised with NH4+ (nitrification) and was possibly due to a greater inhibiting effect of low temperatures on microbial activity controlling denitrification rather than on nitrification. The use of the NO:N2O ratio as a possible indicator of denitrification or nitrification in the formation of N2O and NO was discounted for soils fertilised with NO3-. The N mass balance indicated that about 50 kg N ha(-1) was immobilised by microorganisms and/or taken up by plant roots, and that most of the losses ocurred in wet soils (WFPS > 60%) as N-2 and NH3 losses (> 55%).

Nitrogen monoxide production and consumption in an organic soil. Factors controlling NO production, consumption, and emission rates were examined in an organic soil. Emission rates were measured in the enclosed headspaces of intact soil cores under three fertilisation treatments (unfertilised or 100 kg N ha(-1) as NH4Cl or as NaNO3), with and without the nitrification inhibitor C2H2 (20-70 mu l l(-1)). Nitrification was always the main source of NO emitted across the soil surface, even when the soil was nearly saturated. Fertilisation of soil with NH4Cl increased NO emission both by stimulating NO production from nitrification, and by decreasing the NO consumption rate constant. Addition of NaNO3 also stimulated the production of NO and N2O during nitrification in aerobic soil slurry experiments. This effect was eliminated by adding C2H2 and was therefore not related to denitrification. In loose soil samples, the increase in NO-N production after NH4Cl addition represented as much as 26% of the added N. However, in intact cores, 95% of the NO produced through nitrification was oxidised within the soil column rather than emitted to the atmosphere. We concluded that nitrification is the primary NO source from this organic soil, that surface NO emissions are much lower than gross NO production rates, and that gaseous N oxide (NO and N2O) losses during nitrification can be affected by both soil NH4+ and NO3-.

Rapid nitrate reduction produces pulsed NO and N2O emissions following wetting of dryland soils. Soil drying and wetting cycles can produce pulses of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions with substantial effects on both regional air quality and Earth's climate. While pulsed production of N emissions is ubiquitous across ecosystems, the processes governing pulse magnitude and timing remain unclear. We studied the processes producing pulsed NO and N2O emissions at two contrasting drylands, desert and chaparral, where despite the hot and dry conditions known to limit biological processes, some of the highest NO and N2O flux rates have been measured. We measured N2O and NO emissions every 30 min for 24 h after wetting soils with isotopically-enriched nitrate and ammonium solutions to determine production pathways and their timing. Nitrate was reduced to N2O within 15 min of wetting, with emissions exceeding 1000 ng N-N2O m(-2) s(-1) and returning to background levels within four hours, but the pulse magnitude did not increase in proportion to the amount of ammonium or nitrate added. In contrast to N2O, NO was emitted over 24 h and increased in proportion to ammonium addition, exceeding 600 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1) in desert and chaparral soils. Isotope tracers suggest that both ammonia oxidation and nitrate reduction produced NO. Taken together, our measurements demonstrate that nitrate can be reduced within minutes of wetting summer-dry desert soils to produce large N2O emission pulses and that multiple processes contribute to long-lasting NO emissions. These mechanisms represent substantial pathways of ecosystem N loss that also contribute to regional air quality and global climate dynamics.

Former land-use and tree species affect nitrogen oxide emissions from a tropical dry forest. Species composition in successional dry forests in the tropics varies widely, but the effect of this variation on biogeochemical processes is not well known. We examined fluxes of N oxides (nitrous and nitric oxide), soil N cycling, and litter chemistry (C/N ratio) in four successional dry forests on similar soils in western Puerto Rico with differing species compositions and land-use histories. Forests patch-cut for charcoal 60 years ago had few legumes, high litter C/N ratios, low soil nitrate and low N oxide fluxes. In contrast, successional forests from pastures abandoned several decades ago had high legume densities, low litter C/N ratios, high mean soil nitrate concentrations and high N oxide fluxes. These post-pasture forests were dominated by the naturalized legume Leuceana leucocephala, which was likely responsible for the rapid N cycling in those forests. We conclude that agriculturally induced successional pathways leading to dominance by a legume serve as a mechanism for increasing N oxide emissions from tropical regions. As expected for dry regions, nitric oxide dominated total N oxide emissions. Nitric oxide emissions increased with increasing soil moisture up to about 30% water-filled pore space then stabilized, while nitrous oxide emissions, albeit low, continued to increase with increasing soil wetness. Inorganic N pools and net N mineralization were greatest during peak rainfalls and at the post-agricultural site with the highest fluxes. Soil nitrate and the nitrate/ammonium ratio correlated positively with average N oxide fluxes. N oxide fluxes were negatively and exponentially related to litter C/N ratio for these dry forests and the relationship was upheld with the addition of data from seven wet forests in northeastern Puerto Rico. This finding suggests that species determination of litter C/N ratio may partly determine N oxide fluxes across widely differing tropical environments.

Sensitive Response of Atmospheric Oxidative Capacity to the Uncertainty in the Emissions of Nitric Oxide (NO) From Soils in Amazonia. Soils are a major source of nitrogen oxides, which in the atmosphere help govern its oxidative capacity. Thus the response of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions to forcings such as warming or forest loss has a meaningful impact on global atmospheric chemistry. We find that the soil emission rate of NO in Amazonia from a common inventory is biased low by at least an order of magnitude in comparison to tower-based observations. Accounting for this regional bias decreases the modeled global methane lifetime by 1.4%-2.6%. In comparison, a fully deforested Amazonia, representing a 37% decrease in global emissions of isoprene, decreases methane lifetime by at most 4.6%, highlighting the sensitive response of oxidation rates to changes in emissions of NO compared to those of terpenes. Our results demonstrate that improving our understanding of soil NO emissions will yield a more accurate representation of atmospheric oxidative capacity. Soils emit a gas called nitric oxide (NO). The amount of NO emitted from soils in tropical forests is not well known, but has been assumed to be small. We simulated how different amounts of NO emissions from soils in the Amazon impacted atmospheric chemistry. By comparing our modeled results to observations we found that NO emissions from soils in the Amazon may be between 10 and 20 times larger than the current default assumption. This matters because NO has a strong influence on the rate at which methane and other gasses are removed from the atmosphere. Therefore soil NO emissions end up impacting how long methane can last in the atmosphere, and that would have additional climate impacts. Even though soil NO emissions are smaller than other sources of NO emissions globally, we find that the amount of NO emitted in the Amazon matters a lot for how long methane can last in the atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that improving estimates of soil NO emissions is going to be necessary for making accurate estimates of how long methane and other reactive species will stay in the atmosphere. Soil emission rates of NO in common inventories may be between 10x and 20x too low over the Amazon basin Higher soil NO over the Amazon basin alters the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and decreases global methane lifetime by 1.4%-2.6% Global methane lifetime is more sensitive to Amazon soil NO fluxes than to the loss of terpene fluxes from total deforestation of the Amazon C1 [Lee, Ben H.; Yoon, James Y.

Invasion of Hawaiian rainforests by an introduced amphibian predator and N2-fixing tree increases soil N2O emissions. Invasions of introduced species have homogenized ecological communities worldwide, leading to losses of native species and the services they provide. Some of these invaders substantially alter nutrient cycling, which changes conditions for all other organisms, but less is known about the potential influence of these species on nitrogen (N) trace gas emissions that affect atmospheric processes. We used a natural experiment to explore whether the establishment of an introduced nitrogen (N) fixing tree (Falcataria moluccana) and recent invasion of an amphibian predator, the Caribbean tree frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui), into native Hawaiian rainforests have affected soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), two atmospherically important trace gases produced by soil microorganisms. Soil N2O and NO emissions and rates of soil N cycling were significantly higher in F. moluccana-dominated stands compared to native Metrosideros polymorpha (Ohi'a) stands. Additionally, invasion of E. coqui frogs moderately increased soil N2O emissions, primarily in non-native F. moluccana forests where soil N availability was already elevated. N2O emissions were positively and significantly related to net potential N mineralization, and total N2O+NO fluxes increased with soil nitrate (NO3-) concentration and rates of nitrification. Previous work in these Hawaiian rainforest sites has shown that F. moluccana substantially increases N availability by increasing ecosystem N supply compared to uninvaded stands, and E. coqui accelerates N availability and litter decomposition, although moderately, due to enhanced fluxes of nutrient-rich waste products. Here, we show that acceleration of nutrient cycling by introduced species can also alter biosphere-atmosphere exchange of N-oxides.

Soil-air exchange of nitric oxide: An overview of processes, dnvironmental vactors, and modeling studies. Terrestrial ecosystems with their main elements soil and plants may act, in principle, as both source and sink for atmospheric nitric oxide (NO). The net exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere, however, is globally dominated by biogenic emissions of NO from soils. Consequently the soil-air exchange of NO is the focus of the following overview. Particular emphasis is placed on the major processes that are responsible for NO production in soils (nitrification, denitrification) and their regulation by environmental factors (nitrogen availability, soil water content, soil temperature, ambient NO concentration). It is shown that interactions of these factors are a major reason for the broad range that exists in published data on NO fluxes. This variability makes it difficult to predict the magnitude of NO fluxes on relevant spatial and temporal scales. To overcome the problem various generalization procedures for scaling up in space and time have been developed, and the potential and limitations of the different approaches is discussed.

Differential responses of soil nitrogen-oxide emissions to organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer and biochar amendment in a subtropical tea plantation. Tropical and subtropical acidic soils have been well documented as hotspots of global soil nitrogen (N) oxide (i.e., nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions). While the effectiveness of possible mitigation options has been extensively examined in croplands, little is known about their effectiveness in reducing N-oxide emissions from acidic soils of rapidly expanding tea plantations in China. Here, we conducted a 2-year field experiment to investigate how organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer and biochar amendment affect soil N-oxide emissions from a subtropical tea plantation. Across the 2-year measurement period, full organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer significantly increased N2O emissions by an average of 17% while had a lower NO emission compared to synthetic fertilizer alone. Our global meta-analysis further revealed that full or partial organic fertilizer substitution resulted in a 29% (95% confidence interval: 5%-60%) increase of N2O emissions from acidic soils. In contrast, irrespective of fertilizer type, biochar amendment significantly reduced N2O emissions by 14% in the first but not second experimental year, suggesting a transient effect. The trade-off effect of full organic substitution on N2O and NO emissions may be attributed to the favorable conditions for N2O production due to the stimulated activity of nitrifiers and denitrifiers. The suppression of N2O emission following biochar amendment was probably due to promoted further reduction of N2O to dinitrogen. The fertilizer-induced emission factor (EF) of N2O (2.1%) in the tea plantation was greater than the current IPCC default value, but the EF of NO (0.8%) was comparable to the global estimate. Taken together, while biochar amendment could have mitigation potential, cautions are needed when applying organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer as mitigation options for acidic soils as hotspots of N-oxide emissions.

Effects of pasture management on N2O and NO emissions from soils in the humid tropics of Costa Rica. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) from agricultural soils in the tropics are important in the global budgets of these trace gases. We made monthly measurements of N2O and NO emissions from pastures with three different management systems on volcanic soils in northwestern Costa Rica: traditional (no N input from fertilizer or legumes), pastures with a grass-legume combination, and pastures fertilized with 300 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1). Average annual N2O emissions were 2.7 ng N cm(-2)h(-1) from the traditional pastures, 4.9 ng N cm(-2)h(-1) from the grass-legume pastures, and 25.8 ng N cm(-2)h(-1) from the fertilized pastures. Average annual NO emissions were 0.9, 1.3, and 5.3 ng N cm(-2)h(-1) from traditional, grass-legume and fertilized pastures, respectively. In a separate experiment the effects of ammonium, nitrate, and urea-based fertilizer mixtures on nitrogen oxide fluxes were compared. We measured nitrogen oxide fluxes following four different fertilization events. Nitrogen oxide fluxes were among the highest ever measured. The difference in soil water content between the fertilization events had a far greater effect on N2O and NO emissions than the effect of fertilizer composition. We conclude that the concept of \"emission factors\" for calculating N2O and NO emissions from different types of N fertilizer is flawed because environmental factors are more important than the type of N fertilizer. To estimate fertilizer-induced N2O emission in tropical agriculture, stratification according to soil moisture regime is more useful than stratification according to fertilizer composition.

The influence of tillage on NO and N2O fluxes under spring and winter barley. There is a lack of information about the influence of tillage and time of sowing on N2O and NO emission in cereal production. Both factors influence crop growth and soil conditions and thereby can affect trace gas emissions from soils. We measured fluxes of NO and N2O in a tillage experiment where grassland on clay loam soil was converted to arable by either direct drilling or ploughing to 30 cm depth. We made measurements in spring for 20 days after fertilizer application to spring-sown and to winter-sown barley. Both were the second barley crop after grass. Direct drilling enhanced N2O emission primarily as a result of restricted gas diffusivity causing poor aeration after rainfall. Deep ploughing enhanced NO emission, because of the large air-filled porosity in the topsoil. NO and N2O emissions were smaller from winter sown crops than from spring sown crops. The three rates of N fertilizer application (40, 80 or 120 kg N ha(-1)) did not produce the expected linear response in either soil available N concentrations or in NO and N2O fluxes. We attributed this to the lack of rainfall in the ten-day period after fertilizer application and therefore very slow incorporation and movement of fertilizer into and through the soil.

NO and N2O emissions from agricultural fields in the North China Plain: Origination and mitigation. Agricultural soil has been recognized as a major source of atmospheric NO and N2O emissions which have important impacts on regional and global environments. Here we comparably investigated the effects of ammonium, nitrate fertilizers and nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) addition on NO and N2O emissions from the agricultural soil in the North China Plain (NCP). Compared with the ammonium fertilizer application, the reductions of NO emissions caused by nitrate fertilizer and DCD addition were 100% and 93%, and of N2O emissions were 54% and 74%, respectively. Remarkable reductions of NO and N2O emissions were also observed from five different agricultural soils in the NCP by replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer, indicating that nitrification is the predominant process for the emissions of NO and N2O from the soils in the vast area of NCP. NO emission peaks were found to be several days later than N2O peaks after the application of ammonium fertilizer and flooding irrigation, implying that most of NO initially produced via nitrification process might be fast reduced to N2O under the high soil moisture condition. Interestingly, the relative contribution of denitrification to N2O emission showed obviously time-dependent, e.g., evident N2O emission caused by the application of nitrate was only observed after the basal fertilization for the maize and the top dressing for the wheat. Replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer and mixing with the nitrification inhibitor are verified to be effective measures for mitigating NO and N2O emissions from arable soils in the NCP.

A strong temperature dependence of soil nitric oxide emission from a temperate forest in Northeast China. Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive trace gas affecting atmospheric chemistry and air quality. Although forest soils have been recognized as an important source of atmospheric NO, there are large uncertainties in global forest soil NO emission inventories (ranged from 0.03 to 8.00 kg N ha(-1), averaged 1.34 +/- 0.28 kg N ha(-1)), partly due to the paucity of high-frequency monitoring from unmanaged forests. In this study, we used an automated sampling system to measure NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over two years (daily measurements from January 2019 to December 2020) in a mixed forest in Northeast China. We found that the mean annual NO emission was 0.42 +/- 0.04 kg N ha(-1), being 31% of the global forest average. The contribution of NO emission during the growing season was 92% of the yearly NO flux. Soil temperature was the most important edaphic factor in regulating NO emission, explaining 90-92% of the seasonal variation. The apparent temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of NO flux was 3.67. In the growing season, NO emission was also influenced by soil moisture, with optimum soil moisture of 37% WFPS. By providing a detailed measurement of diurnal, seasonal, and annual dynamics of NO emissions and their environmental controls from forest soils, our data are useful to develop more accurate biogeochemical models that will improve upscaled global NO budgets.

Effectiveness of urease inhibition on the abatement of ammonia, nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions in a non-irrigated Mediterranean barley field. Urea is considered the cheapest and most commonly used form of inorganic N fertilizer worldwide. However, its use is associated with emissions of ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), which have both economic and environmental impact. Urease activity inhibitors have been proposed as a means to reduce NH3 emissions, although limited information exists about their effect on N2O and NO emissions. In this context, a field experiment was carried out with a barley crop (Hordeum vulgare L) under Mediterranean conditions to test the effectiveness of the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) on reducing these gaseous N losses from surface applied urea. Crop yield, soil mineral N concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), denitrification potential, NH3, N2O and NO fluxes were measured during the growing season. The inclusion of the inhibitor reduced NH3 emissions in the 30 d following urea application by 58% and net N2O and NO emissions in the 95 d following urea application by 86% and 88%, respectively. NBPT addition also increased grain yield by 5% and N uptake by 6%, although neither increase was statistically significant. Under the experimental conditions presented here, these results demonstrate the potential of the urease inhibitor NBPT in abating NH3, N2O and NO emissions from arable soils fertilized with urea, slowing urea hydrolysis and releasing lower concentrations of NH4+ to the upper soil layer.

NO emissions from soils in the southeastern United States. Biogenic soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO) are important in the formation of tropospheric ozone (O-3) in the rural environment. This paper summarizes our recent estimates of soil NO emissions from a wide variety of sites in nine southeastern United States, A total of over 12,000 individual flux measurements was made from crop, pasture, and forests representing major physiographic regions within the southeast. These measurements were used to determine flux algorithms relating NO emissions from land types. Strong relationships were found between NO flux and temperature that explained over 80% of the variation in emissions. Using these relationships and Geographic Information Systems land base information for the states, calculated seasonal emissions for NO are reported. Crop land regulated regional soil NO emissions, accounting for 83% of the emissions in summer, 61% in spring, and 55% in fall, The summertime contribution of soil NO to the overall NO inventory, including anthropogenic sources, averaged 4.1% for the states, ranging from a high of 9.5% for Mississippi to a low of 2.2% for Florida. The importance of high summertime temperatures in controlling soil NO was evident in that emissions on a prototypical summer day were only one fifth the emissions of a hot (36 degrees C, maximum daily high) summer day. Comparisons of the algorithms we developed to those of the current model used by the Environmental Protection Agency, BEIS 2.2, showed reasonable agreement, that is, agreement within a factor of 2, given the inherent temporal and spatial variability of soil NO emissions. ", "Nitric oxide emissions from agricultural soils in temperate and tropical climates: sources, controls and mitigation options. Nitric oxide emissions from agricultural soils in temperate and tropical climates: sources, controls and mitigation options. Global annual NO emissions from soil are of the order of 10 Tg NO-N. This is about half the amount fossil fuel combustion processes contribute to the annual global NOx budget. Reducing the emissions of soil derived NOx requires an understanding of the source of the flux and the processes that determine its magnitude. A thorough investigation of possible mitigation strategies and the consequences of their implementation is also necessary. The ratio of NO and N2O emissions from soils can be used as an indicator of the dominant NO production pathway operating. Fertilizer application (rate, type and time of application), soil temperature, soil water content and soil management practices all affect the emission rate and are reviewed. Mitigation options include reduction in N fertilizer use through an increase in fertilizer use efficiency, preferential use of NH4NO3 instead of urea, improved timing of fertilizer application, the use of nitrification and urease inhibitors, improving the fertilizer uptake efficiency of crops in tropical agriculture and changes in land management. Several of the viable mitigation strategies, mainly those increasing fertilizer use efficiency, have the capacity to reduce global annual NO emissions by 4% (0.4 Tg NO-N y(-1)). For other strategies including use of inhibitors, changing cultivation or land use, the possible reductions are too uncertain to justify quantification on the basis of present knowledge. biomass burning; fertilizer use efficiency; mitigation options; nitrification inhibitors; nitric oxide; NO; N fertilizers; soil NO emissions; tillage", "Characterization of biogenic nitric oxide source strength in the southeast United States. Characterization of biogenic nitric oxide source strength in the southeast United States. Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) were measured during the summer of 1995 from 4 crops, located at three different sites throughout North Carolina. These sites were chosen to represent major physiographic regions of the Southeast US, in an effort to compare fluxes from different agriculturally managed soils. Emission rates were determined using a dynamic flow-through chamber system. In order to understand the NO flux from the different soil and crop types, measurements were made on corn and soybean crops in the coastal region, tobacco in the piedmont region, and corn in the upper piedmont region of North Carolina. Average NO fluxes were 5.5 +/- 2.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1), 20.7 +/- 19.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1), 4.1 +/- 1.4 ng N m(-2) s(-1), and 8.5 +/- 4.9 ng N m-2 s(-1) respectively for corn and soybean in the coastal region, tobacco in the piedmont region, and corn in the upper piedmont region. We were only able to detect an exponential dependence of NO flux on soil temperature at two of the locations. The composite data of all the research sites revealed a general trend of increasing NO flux with soil water content or increasing extractable nitrogen in the soil, however, the day to day variations within each site did not reveal the same trends. We feel that acquisition of a soil NO flux data set in this fashion, which consists of observations collected over different points in both space and time, makes attempts to model soil NO flux in terms of different soil parameters difficult.

Emissions of ammonia and nitric oxide from an agricultural site following application of different synthetic fertilizers and manures. In the present study, ammonia (NIL) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions were measured by the dynamic flux chamber (DFC) method from a cropland of Chinese cabbage over a one and a half month period (September-October, 2006). By applying a combination of three treatment M types (comprising different proportions of manure, urea, and NPK fertilizer) to the crop field, the effects of such treatments on emission flux were assessed in relation to the amount and type of fertilizer. The magnitude of NIL emission (mu g m(-2) h(-1)) varied in the following order: T-2 (4,067), T-1 (2,263) and T-3 (738). NO fluxes ( mu g m(-2) h(-1)) also followed the same descending order of T-2 (898) > T-1 (477) > T-3 (81). The possible effects of soil pH on NH3 fluxes were detected, as they concurrently exhibited a gradual and periodic change during the experimental period. Likewise, temperature was also found to have significant effect on NH3 and NO emission behavior. The results of the present work confirm that the application of fertilizer, when tested in the form of diverse treatment types, affected the emission of NH3 and NO in fertilized field soils at varying degrees.

Influence of acid rain and liming on fluxes of NO and NO2 from forest soil. Flux measurements of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were performed in a coniferous forest (Hoglwald) in southern Germany using a fully automated measuring system based on the dynamic chamber method. The forest soil was predominately a source of NO, but mean flux rates of NO ranged from -26.3 (deposition) to 55 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) (emission). NO2 was deposited on the forest soil with mean flux rates ranging from -4 to -72 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Removal of forest floor vegetation did not influence NO or NO2 fluxes. Apparently, forest floor vegetation was neither a source of NO nor a significant sink of NO2. When the organic layer of the forest soil was removed, net NO flux changed from emission to deposition. Thus NO emitted to the atmosphere was produced almost exclusively in the organic layer of the forest soil. Liming caused a significant decrease in the rate of NO emission by 43 to 100%, whereas irrigation with simulated acid rain increased the emission of NO by a factor of 3.1. Irrigation with simulated \"normal\" rain decreased the emission of NO by 35 to 100%. No such effects could be detected for the deposition of NO2.

The influence of stochastic soil moisture dynamics on gaseous emissions of NO, N2O, and N2. Even though the fundamental role played by nitrogen oxides in several important atmospheric processes is generally acknowledged, the understanding and quantitative evaluation of some mechanisms involved in the biogenic emission of N gases is still incomplete. Because of the number and variety of chemical, biological and physical processes involved, their mutual interaction and the strong nonlinearities, the dynamics of biogenic nitrogen oxide emission are complex and difficult to study. In this context, this study is centred on the link between soil water content and gaseous emissions of N, and oxidized nitrogen gas, NO and N2O, from the ground. In particular, the study investigates how the probability distribution of soil moisture affects the distribution of the emission rate of nitrogen and nitrogen oxides when other limiting factors are absent. Some analytical tools are provided for the estimation of the steady-state probability density function of the emission rate. These toots are then used to investigate the influence of characteristics of rainfall regimes, plant transpiration, and soil texture on the emission process. It results that: (a) both frequency and depth of the storms strongly influence the shape and the moments of the probability density function of the emission rates; (b) higher values of plant transpiration favour nitric oxide emissions and give rise to higher variances in the emission rates; and (c) N2O emissions are greater in fine-textured soils than in coarser soils, while NO emissions are higher in coarser soils and can be very low in clayey soils where, instead, N-2 emissions become significant.

Annual emissions of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide from a wheat-maize cropping system on a silt loam calcareous soil in the North China Plain. Nitrogen amendment followed by flooding irrigation is a general management practice fora wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain, which may favor nitrification and denitrification. Consequently, high emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are hypothesized to occur. To test this hypothesis, we performed year-round field measurements of N2O and NO fluxes from irrigated wheat-maize fields on a calcareous soil applied with all crop residues using a static, opaque chamber measuring system. To interpret the field data, laboratory experiments using intact soil cores with added carbon (glucose) and nitrogen (nitrate, ammonium) substrates were performed. Our field measurements showed that pulse emissions after fertilization and irrigation/rainfall contributed to 73% and 88% of the annual N2O and NO emissions, respectively. Soil moisture and mineral nitrogen contents significantly affected the emissions of both gases. Annual emissions from fields fertilized at the conventional rate (600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) totaled 4.0 +/- 0.2 and 3.0 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively, while those from unfertilized fields were much lower (0.5 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.4 +/- 0.05 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Direct emission factors (EF(d)s) of N2O and NO for the fertilizer nitrogen were estimated to be 0.59 +/- 0.04% and 0.44 +/- 0.04%, respectively. By summarizing the results of our study and others, we recommended specific EF(d)s (N2O: 0.54 +/- 0.09%; NO: 0.45 +/- 0.04%) for estimating emissions from irrigated croplands on calcareous soils with organic carbon ranging from 5 to 16 g kg(-1). Nitrification dominated the processes driving the emissions of both gases following fertilization. It was evident that insufficient available carbon limited microbial denitrification and thus N2O emission. This implicates that efforts to enhance carbon sink in calcareous soils likely increase their N2O emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Biogenic Nitric Oxide Emission of Mountain Soils Sampled from Different Vertical Landscape Zones in the Changbai Mountains, Northeastern China. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important component in nitrogen biogeochemical cycling produced through biological processes of nitrification and denitrification in soils, but the production and the consumption processes of NO in temperate mountain soil are less understood. Through laboratory experiments focusing on NO biogenic emissions from six kinds of mountain soils sampled from different vertical landscape zones, that is, coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest (CBE), fir forest (FF), spruce forest (SF), Erman's birch forest (EBF), alpine tundra (AT), and volcanic ash (VA), in the Changbai Mountains, northeastern China, we found that the optimum water-filled pore space (WFPS) for NO production varies between 22.5% and 35% for a range of mountain soils. The optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO emission for a certain soil type, however, was constant and independent of soil temperature. The NO emission potential for forest soils was about 7-50-fold higher than tundra soil and volcanic ash, indicating that it is strongly influenced by nutrient contents in soils. On the basis of laboratory results and field monitoring data, the average NO fluxes from these mountain soils were estimated to be 0.14-29.56 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for an entire plant growth period. NO emissions mainly occur in wet season for CBF and FF, but in dry season for other soil types.

THE EFFECTS OF FIRE ON BIOGENIC SOIL EMISSIONS OF NITRIC OXIDE AND NITROUS OXIDE. Measurements of biogenic soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) before and after a controlled burn conducted in a chaparral ecosystem on June 22, 1987, showed significantly enhanced emissions of both gases after the burn. Mean NO emissions from heavily burned and wetted (to simulate rainfall) sites exceeded 40 ng N m(-2) s(-1), an increase of 2 to 3 compared to preburn wetted site measurements. N2O emissions from burned and wetted sites ranged from 9 to 22 ng N m(-2) s(-1). Preburn N2O emissions from these wetted sites were all below the detection level of the instrumentation, indicating a flux below 2 ng N m(-2) s(-1). The flux of NO exceeded the N2O flux from burned wetted sites by factors ranging from 2.7 to 3.4. These measurements coupled with preburn and postburn measurements of ammonium and nitrate in the soil of this chaparral ecosystem and measurements of NO and N2O emissions obtained under controlled laboratory conditions suggest that the postfire enhancement of NO and N2O emissions is due to production of these gases by nitrifying bacteria.

Environmental controls on nitric oxide emission from northern Chihuahuan desert soils. A survey of nitric oxide (NO) emission from Chihuahuan desert soils found mean NO fluxes < 0.1 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1) during the dry season. These fluxes were at the lower end of the range reported for temperate grassland and woodland ecosystems. NO fluxes from wet or watered soils were higher (0.1-35 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1)). Watering of black grama grassland soils produced an initial pulse of 12 ng cm(-2) h(-1) (12-h after 1-cm watering) with high fluxes sustained over 4 days with repeated watering. Initial pulses from shrubland soils were lower (maximum 5 ng cm(-2) h(-1)), and fluxes declined with repeated watering. Repeated watering of creosotebush soils depleted the soil NH4+ pool, and NO emissions were directly related to soil NH4+ concentrations at the end of the experiment. In watered and NH4+-fertilized creosotebush soils, NO fluxes were positively related to potential net nitrification rates. NH4+-fertilization boosted the initial NO pulse 15 times in the shrubland and 5 times in black grama grassland relative to watered controls. These experimental results point toward greater substrate limitation in shrublands. In this desert basin, NO emission averaged 0.12 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) in untreated soil and 0.76 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) in watered soil. We multiplied these averages by the distribution of grassland and shrubland vegetation within a 58,600-ha area of the Jornada del Muerto basin to estimate regional losses of 0.15-0.38 kg NO-N ha(-1) y(-1) for this area of the Chihuahuan desert.

MEASUREMENTS OF NITRIC-OXIDE FLUX FROM AN UPPER COASTAL-PLAIN, NORTH-CAROLINA AGRICULTURAL SOIL. Agricultural soil NO flux measurements (using a dynamic chamber technique) were made from 18 August to 1 September 1993 in the Upper Coastal Plain region of North Carolina in an effort to determine the role of natural emissions of NO on rural atmospheric photochemistry. Overall average NO flux rates increased proportionally to the level of applied fertilizer nitrogen in the agricultural soil. The soybean, cotton, and corn field measurements revealed an average NO flux of 1.79 (range - 1.0-6.9) ng N m(-2) s(-1); 3.77 (range - 0.1-38.0) ng N m(-2) s(-1); and 8.05 (range - 0.5-52.8) ng N m(-2) s(-1) respectively. There was a positive correlation between NO concentration near the soil surface (similar to 50 cm) and NO flux. A significant negative correlation between NO flux and ambient O-3 concentration, however, supports the hypothesis that soil emissions of NO contribute to local production of O-3 in rural areas.

Post-fire soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) across global ecosystems: a review. Wildfires may increase soil emissions of trace nitrogen (N) gases like nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) by changing soil physicochemical conditions and altering microbial processes like nitrification and denitrification. When 34 studies were synthesized, we found a significant increase in both NO and N2O emissions up to 1 year post-fire across studies spanning ecosystems globally. However, when fluxes were separated by ecosystem type, we found that individual ecosystem types responded uniquely to fire. Forest soils tended to emit more N2O after fire, but there was no significant effect on NO. Shrubland soils showed significant increases in both NO and N2O emissions after fires; often with extremely large but short-lived NO pulses occurring immediately after fire. Grassland NO emissions increased after fire, but the size of this effect was small relative to shrublands. N2O emissions from burned grasslands were highly variable with no significant effect. To better understand the variation in responses to fire across global ecosystems, more consistent measurements of variables recognized as important controls on soil fluxes of NO and N2O (e.g., N cycling rates, soil water content, pH, and substrate availability) are needed across studies. We also suggest that fire-specific elements like burn severity, microbial community succession, and the presence of char be considered by future studies. Our synthesis suggests that fires can exacerbate ecosystem N loss long after they burn, increasing soil emissions of NO and N2O with implications for ecosystem N loss, climate, and regional air quality as wildfires increase globally.

Biological oxidation of nitric oxide in a humisol. Consumption of nitric oxide (NO) in a humisol was studied at 0.1-2 ppmv NO, a range representative of NO concentrations in ammonium-fertilized soil. Denitrification was not a major sink for NO. The principal NO-consuming reaction was a biological oxidation, leading ultimately to nitrate (NO2). Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrite (NO) may have been intermediates in this pathway. An abiological reaction accounted for about 25% of the NO-consuming activity in soil at 90% H2O (d.w.) and 25 degrees C, but contributed relatively more to total NO consumption at higher temperatures. Biological NO-consuming activity was highest at 25 degrees C, while the abiological activity increased exponentially with temperature. The product of the abiological reaction was neither NO3-, NO2-, nor nitrous oxide (N2O), and the reaction did not require O-2.

AN INVENTORY OF NITRIC-OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM SOILS IN THE UNITED-STATES. A national inventory of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions with county spatial resolution and monthly time resolution has been developed from empirical relationships that were derived from soil NO emissions data. The empirical relationships used to develop the inventory relate the emission of NO to soil temperature and a factor which is representative of an ecosystem or type of land use. Most of the ecosystem/land use factors were derived from analyses of NO emission data from seven different sites in the United States that are representative of three ecosystems and two agricultural land use types. Other agricultural (crop) land use factors were estimated from the two calculated factors based on differences in fertilization associated with the crops. This soil emission inventory exhibits three general features. First, croplands, especially where corn is grown, appear to be significant sources of NO. This has important implications because agricultural activities tend to be localized to certain regions in the United States (i.e., the Midwest) and are highest during the summer, when photochemistry is also most active. Second, undisturbed areas, such as grasslands, forests, and wetlands, do not appear to contribute substantially to atmospheric NO. Third, extensive areas in the western United States have not been included because soil NO emission data are lacking. C1 UNIV COLORADO, COOPERAT INST RES ENVIRONM SCI, BOULDER, CO 80309 USA.

Nitrogen oxides emission from two beech forests subjected to different nitrogen loads. We analysed nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO) and carbon dioxide ( CO2) emissions from two beech forest soils close to Vienna, Austria, which were exposed to different nitrogen input from the atmosphere. The site Schottenwald (SW) received 20.2 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and Klausenleopoldsdorf ( KL) 12.6 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) through wet deposition. Nitric oxide emissions from soil were measured hourly with an automatic dynamic chamber system. Daily N2O measurements were carried out by an automatic gas sampling system. Measurements of nitrous oxide (N2O) and CO2 emissions were conducted over larger areas on a biweekly ( SW) or monthly (KL) basis by manually operated chambers. We used an autoregression procedure (time-series analysis) for establishing time-lagged relationships between N-oxides emissions and different climate, soil chemistry and N-deposition data. It was found that changes in soil moisture and soil temperature significantly effected CO2 and N-oxides emissions with a time lag of up to two weeks and could explain up to 95% of the temporal variations of gas emissions. Event emissions after rain or during freezing and thawing cycles contributed significantly (for NO 50%) to overall N-oxides emissions. In the two-year period of analysis the annual gaseous N2O emissions at SW ranged from 0.64 to 0.79 kg Nha(-1) y(-1) and NO emissions were 0.24 to 0.49 kg Nha(-1) per vegetation period. In KL significantly lower annual N2O emissions (0.52 to 0.65 kg N2O-N kg ha(-1) y(-1)) as well as considerably lower NO-emissions were observed. During a three-month measurement campaign NO emissions at KL were 0.02 kg N ha(-1)), whereas in the same time period significantly more NO was emitted in SW (0.32 kg NO-N ha(-1)). Higher N oxides emissions, especially NO emissions from the high N-input site (SW) may indicate that atmospheric deposition has an impact on emissions of gaseous N from our forest soils. At KL there was a strong correlation between N-deposition and N-emission over time, which shows that low N-input sites are especially responsive to increasing N-inputs.

Large Contribution of Nitrous Acid to Soil-Emitted Reactive Oxidized Nitrogen and Its Effect on Air Quality. Soil emissions have long been recognized as an important source of nitric oxide (NO), which regulates atmospheric oxidative capacity and the production of air pollutants. Recent research has also indicated that nitrous acid (HONO) can be emitted in significant quantities from soil microbial activities. However, only a few studies have quantified emissions of HONO along with NO from a wide range of soil types. In this study, we measured emissions of HONO and NO from soil samples collected from 48 sites across China and found much higher emissions of HONO than of NO, especially for samples from northern China. We performed a meta-analysis of 52 field studies in China, which revealed that long-term fertilization increased the abundance of nitrite-producing genes much more than the abundance of NO-producing genes. This promotion effect was greater in northern China than in southern China. In simulations using a chemistry transport model with laboratory-derived parametrization, we found that HONO emissions had a greater effect than NO emissions on air quality. Moreover, we determined that with projected continuous reductions in anthropogenic emissions, the contribution from soils to maximum 1 h concentrations of hydroxyl radicals and ozone and daily average concentrations of particulate nitrate in the Northeast Plain will increase to 17%, 4.6%, and 14%, respectively. Our findings highlight the need to consider HONO in the assessment of the loss of reactive oxidized nitrogen from soils to the atmosphere and its effect on air quality.

Soil N intensity as a measure to estimate annual N2O and NO fluxes from natural and managed ecosystems. As natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems are major sources of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and of the atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO), predicting the source strengths of these ecosystems is central to understanding and sustainably managing the N-oxides fluxes. Here we reviewed 82 high temporal resolution datasets on N2O and 57 on NO fluxes collected from multi-site and multi-year field measurements, including grasslands, forests, and agricultural crops, to assess whether soil N intensity, that is, the time-weighted sum of soil NH4+ and/or NO3- concentrations, can be used to estimate annual N-oxides emissions. We show that soil N intensity alone can accurately predict annual N2O and NO emissions, and that the N2O emission strength is exponentially related to the soil inorganic N load. Thus, measuring soil inorganic N loads should improve current estimates of N-oxide emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, and open possibilities for monitoring N2O mitigation efforts.

We evaluate our soil N2O emission estimates against existing emissions inventories, other processbased model estimates, and observations from sites in the Amazon, North America, Central America, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and in Europe. The model reproduces precipitation, soil temperature, and observations of N2O emissions well at some but not at all sites and especially not during winter in the higher latitudes.

Biochar-enriched soil mitigated N2O and NO emissions similarly as fresh biochar for wheat production. Biochar amendment has been recommended as a potential strategy to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions for wheat production, but its mechanism and effective duration are not well understood. The 1-octyne and 2-pheny l-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) in combination with potassium chlorate were used to evaluate the relative contribution of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) to potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) and N2O and NO production as affected by biochar. Acidic and alkaline soils were collected during wheat-growing season, and four treatments were installed in each soil type: CK, urea alone; BE, biochar-enriched soil for 2-6 years; FB, fresh biochar added to CK; and AB, aged biochar added to CK. The results showed that octyne and PTIO efficiently assessed AOB and AOA activities in soil incubation. The AOB-driven PAO in acidic soil was largely enhanced by increased soil pH in BE and FB treatments, whereas AOA-driven PAO was not. And the contribution of AOB to PAO exceeded 80% in alkaline soil. The N2O and NO production were positively correlated with PAO in both soils. BE treatment decreased the direct N2O and NO production in alkaline soil, while both BE and FB treatments decreased the N2O and NO yields in acidic soil, indicating that biochar mitigated soil N2O and NO emissions for wheat production. The lack of differences between AB and CK treatments indicated that aged biochar lost its initial effects on PAO, while the biocharenriched soil amended with biochar years earlier still functioned similarly as fresh biochar.

Modeling of nitric oxide emissions from temperate agricultural soils. Arable soils are a significant source of nitric oxide (NO), most of which is derived from nitrogen fertilizers. Accurate estimates of NO emissions from these soils are essential to devise strategies to mitigate the impact of agriculture on tropospheric ozone production and destruction. This paper presents the implementation of a soil NO emissions submodel within the environmentally-orientated soil-crop model, CERES-EGC. The submodel simulates NO production via the nitrification pathway, as modulated by soil environmental drivers. The resulting model was tested with data from 4 field experiments on wheat- and maize-cropped soils representative of two agricultural regions of France, over three years, and encompassing various climatic conditions. Overall, the model provided accurate predictions of NO emissions, but shortcomings arose from an inadequate vertical distribution of N fertilizer in the soil surface. Inclusion of a 2-cm thick topsoil layer in a 'micro-layer' version of CERES-EGC gave more realistic simulations of NO emissions and under-lying microbiological process. From a statistical point of view, both versions of the model achieved a similar fit to the experimental data, with respectively a MD and a RMSE ranging from 1.8 to 6.2 g N-NO ha(-1)d(-1), and from 22.8 to 25.2 g N-NO ha(-1)d(-1) across the 4 experiments. The cumulative NO losses represented 1-2% of NH4+ fertilizer applied in the case of maize crops, and about 1% in the case of wheat crops. The 'micro-layer' version may be used for spatialized inventories of NO emissions to improve air quality prediction.

Influence of vegetables canopy on the NO emission was investigated and quantified. It was found that on cloudy days the canopy can only shield NO emission from croplands soil while on sunny days it cannot only prevent NO emission but also assimilate NO through the open leaves stomas. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that soil temperature was the most important factor in controlling NO emission, followed by fertilizer amount and gravimetric soil water content.

Emissions of nitric oxide from soils of equatorial rain forest were measured in the Dimonika Natural Park (4-degrees30'S, 12-degrees30'E) in the Mayombe Forest in Congo. Three research campaigns were carried out in June and July 1991 and in February 1992. Fluxes were measured by dynamic chamber techniques using a chemiluminescence instrument Scintrex LMA3. NO fluxes measured on natural soils are in between 5 and 17 x 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1; they are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in similar tropical forest media. Soil treatment experiments show that the auto-decomposition of HNO2 in these acid soils (pH # 4) (chemodenitrification) is a potentially important cause of nitric oxide production in this type of ecosystem. Nitrous acid comes from autotrophic nitrification all the year round, and also from biological denitrification, shown by N2O emissions, during the rainy season. The regulation of NO release from soils is linked to ammonia production from litter mineralisation and to direct NH4 input by throughfall.

Nitrogen isotopic signature of soil-released nitric oxide (NO) after fertilizer application. Nitrogen isotopic signatures are very useful for identifying sources of atmospheric NOx or NO3. Although soil is a major source of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), yet nitrogen isotopic composition of soil-released NO has not been directly measured. Since a large portion of soil NO emission is induced by fertilizer application in food production, in the present study we determined N isotopic signatures of NO from cropland soils fertilized with urea and ammonium bicarbonate (ABC). NO was oxidized to NO2 and then converted to nitrite for nitrogen isotope analysis; tests with NO standard gas revealed no significant nitrogen isotopic fractioning during the trapping and processing procedures. While the applied urea and ABC had delta N-15 values of + 1.3 parts per thousand and + 7.2 parts per thousand, respectively, soil-released NO had delta N-15 values increasing from -48.9 parts per thousand (day 2) to -28.0 parts per thousand (day 13) after urea fertilization and from -48.6 parts per thousand (day 2) to -19.9 parts per thousand (day 13) after ABC fertilization. This much N-15 depleted isotopic composition of soil-released NO makes it possible to distinguish soil emission from fuel combustion for the contribution of atmospheric NOx or NO3. Nitrogen isotopic compositions of soil substrate NH4+ and NO3- were also determined, and the instantaneous nitrogen isotopic enrichment factor of NO relative to those of substrate NH4+ and NO3- indicated both nitrification and denitrification occurred for NO production, although only NH4+-based fertilizers were applied.

Emissions from clayey soils in a beech forest were much lower, ranging from 0 to 14 ng m(-2) s(-1). Besides the important effect of the forest community type and the soil texture on the NO flux, a strong positive correlation with soil temperature was observed (accounting for up to 70% of the variance). Soil moisture could explain up to 60% of the variance of the NO flux. It seems that an optimum range of intermediate moisture content exists, ranging from 30 to 45% dry weight or from 55 to 85% water-filled pore space, approximately, where high temperatures lead to high emissions.

Nitric oxide fluxes from soils in the Trachypogon savanna of the Orinoco basin were deter mined during the dry season using the static chamber method. The emission from dry soils fluctuated from 0.4 to 3 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and increased up to 25 ng N m(-2) s(-1) after moderate watering or light rainfalls (1 to 5 mm). The mean emission values are up to 6 times lower than one observed earlier at the Chaguaramas site, but up to 10 times higher than one recorded at the Guri site, indicating an important spatial variability in NO fluxes of the Venezuelan savanna region. The changes observed after the addition of nitrogen to the soil, in the form of ammonium and/or nitrate, indicate a high denitrification potential in this acidic soil. Burning of the surface vegetation produced an increase by a factor of 10 in the emission rate of NO, but the effect was relatively short in time, about 5 days. It was estimated for the savanna region that burning increases the total NO soil emission during the dry season by 15% compared to the unburnt case. Soils with termite nests emit 10 times more NO than soil without nests, but the contribution from this source is less than 2% of the total savanna soil flux.

The relationships have been analyzed by the comparison of experimental measurements coming from analysis of variance statistical analysis, referring to toluene concentrations.

The application of organic and mineral fertilisers to soil can result in increased gaseous emissions to the atmosphere such as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. The aim of this study was to evaluate under laboratory conditions the effects on mineral N dynamics and NO and N2O emissions of application to soil of cattle slurry derived liquid fraction (LF) obtained by screw press and mineral fertiliser (MF), both treated with or without the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). An aerobic laboratory incubation was performed over 93 days with a Dystric Cambisol amended with mechanically separated LF or mineral fertiliser ammonium sulphate only or combined with DMPP. Two additional treatments were included: soil only and soil amended with DMPP. Nitrogen immobilisation was the dominant process with ME amendment, whereas N mineralisation has been observed with LF. The application of LF reduced significantly NO emissions by 80% relative to mineral but no differences were observed with N2O emissions. The addition of DMPP to MF induced a decrease of 18 and 29% in NO and N2O emissions whereas DMPP combined with LF reduced (numerically but not statistically) these emissions in 20 and 10%, respectively. Results obtained in our study suggest that N (NO + N2O) losses can be mitigated by adding DMPP to mineral fertilisers or replacing mineral fertiliser by LF.

Diurnal variation of nitric oxide emission flux from a mangrove wetland in Zhangjiang River Estuary, China. The diurnal variation of nitric oxide (NO) emission fluxes from a Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina mangrove wetland were studied in the Zhangjiang River Estuary Mangrove National Nature Reserve using a dynamic chamber-based technique and a chemiluminescent analyzer. Results from field experiments show that NO emission from K. obovata and A. marina sampling sites reached maximal values of 1.07 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and 1.23 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively after the night tide. Meanwhile NO emission maintained at a steady lower level in daytime for both wetland sites. In laboratory experiments, NO emission from the mangrove wetland soil samples treated with simulated tides in the darkness exhibited higher values than those in the light, therefore it seems that tides and darkness could increase NO emission from mangrove wetlands, while intensive light, high temperature, and dryness in the daytime decreased NO emission. Compared with K. obovata soil samples, the diurnal average NO emission rate of the A. marina site was significantly higher, which was closely related to relatively higher diurnal average CO2 emission rate, soil available nitrogen content and soil net nitrification rate of the A. marina site. Moreover, soil samples of the A. marina site were more responsive to simulated tides and the addition of nitrogen than those of the K. obovata site. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Emissions of atmospherically reactive gases nitrous acid and nitric oxide from Arctic permafrost peatlands. Soils are important sources of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO) in the atmosphere. These nitrogen (N)-containing gases play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry and climate at different scales because of reactions modulated by NO and hydroxyl radicals (OH), which are formed via HONO photolysis. Northern permafrost soils have so far remained unexplored for HONO and NO emissions despite their high N stocks, capacity to emit nitrous oxide (N2O), and enhancing mineral N turnover due to warming and permafrost thawing. Here, we report the first HONO and NO emissions from high-latitude soils based on measurements of permafrost-affected subarctic peatlands. We show large HONO (0.1-2.4 mu g N m(-2)h(-1)) and NO (0.4-59.3 mu g N m(-2)h(-1)) emissions from unvegetated peat surfaces, rich with mineral N, compared to low emissions (<= 0.2 mu g N m(-2)h(-1) for both gases) from adjacent vegetated surfaces (experiments with intact peat cores). We observed HONO production under highly variable soil moisture conditions from dry to wet. However, based on complementary slurry experiments, HONO production was strongly favored by high soil moisture and anoxic conditions. We suggest urgent examination of other Arctic landscapes for HONO and NO emissions to better constrain the role of these reactive N gases in Arctic atmospheric chemistry.

The impact of management and climate on soil nitric oxide fluxes from arable land in the Southern Ukraine. NO fluxes from soils are a significant source for tropospheric NOR, though global and regional estimates of the soil source strength are constrained by the paucity of measurements. In a continuous 18 month effort (2012-2014) soil NO fluxes from an intensively managed arable site in the black soil region of the Southern Ukraine (Odessa region) were measured using an automated dynamic chamber system. Measurements revealed three periods of peak NO emissions (fertigation, re-wetting of soils, and to a lower extend during winter), with a pulse emission peak during soil re-wetting in summer of 88.4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). The mean annual NO flux was 5.1 +/- 8.9 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) and total annual NO emissions were 0.44 +/- 0.78 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The fertilizer induced emission factor for NO was 0.63% under beetroot. The combined effect of soil temperature, soil moisture and soil DIN (NH4+ and NO3-) concentrations were identified as drivers of the temporal and spatial variability of soil NO fluxes. This work shows that long-term measurements are needed for estimating annual fluxes and the importance of soils as a source for tropospheric NOx as the contribution of different seasons and crop growing periods to the annual budget differed markedly.

Soil nitric oxide emissions from terrestrial ecosystems in China: a synthesis of modeling and measurements. Soils are among the major sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), which play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry. Here we systematically synthesized the modeling studies and field measurements and presented a novel soil NO emission inventory of terrestrial ecosystems in China. The previously modeled inventories ranged from 480 to 1375 and from 242.8 to 550 Gg N yr(-1) for all lands and croplands, respectively. Nevertheless, all the previous modeling studies were conducted based on very few measurements from China. According to the current synthesis of field measurements, most soil NO emission measurements were conducted at croplands, while the measurements were only conducted at two sites for forest and grassland. The median NO flux was 3.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1) with a fertilizer induced emission factor (FIE) of 0.04% for rice fields, and was 7.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1) with an FIE of 0.67% for uplands. A novel NO emission inventory of 1226.33 (ranging from 588.24 to 2132.05) Gg N yr(-1) was estimated for China's terrestrial ecosystems, which was about 18% of anthropogenic emissions. More field measurements should be conducted to cover more biomes and obtain more representative data in order to well constrain soil NO emission inventory of China.

NO emission from an Amazonian rain forest soil: Continuous measurements of NO flux and soil concentration. The net nitric oxide (NO) flux from the soil of a tropical rain forest site in Reserva Biologica Jaru (Rondonia, Brazil) was continuously measured in May and during September-November 1999 using dynamic chambers. The median net NO flux was 4.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in May (1000 individual measurements) and 4.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in September-November (4200 individual measurements). The daily variation of the net NO flux was positively correlated to the daily variations of soil temperature. Minor rain events (<10 mm) had no significant influence on the 24-hour mean net NO flux. Following larger amounts of rain, a 40% reduction of the 24-hour mean net NO flux up to a 150% increase was observed. During the September-November experiment the soil NO concentration and the soil NO bulk diffusion coefficient were measured to calculate the net NO flux using an indirect method. The soil NO concentration was continuously measured at 0.03-m depth. It ranged from 20 to 460 ppb and was positively correlated with soil moisture and soil temperature. The soil bulk diffusion coefficient determined from Rn-222 flux and soil-air activity gradient measurements ranged from 2.7 x 10(-7) to 9.1 x 10(-7) m(-2) s(-1\\) and was parameterized with soil air-filled pore space.

Environmental variables controlling nitric oxide emissions from agricultural soils in the southeast United States. Fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) Were measured during the summer of 1994 (12 July to 11 August) in the Upper Coastal Plain of North Carolina in a continuing effort to characterize NO emissions from intensively managed agricultural soils in the southeastern United States. Previous work during a similar time of year on the same soil type was characterized by severe moisture stress conditions. The summer of 1994 provided a more diverse weather pattern and as a result represented a set of measurements more typical of soil temperature and soil moisture relationships for the southeastern United States. In order to ascertain NO Aux response to fertilization and crop type, measurements were made on fields with three distinct fertilizer practices and crop types, namely corn, cotton, and soybean. Average NO fluxes were 21.9 +/- 18.6, 4.3 +/- 3.7, and 2.1 +/- 0.9 ng N m(-1)s(-1), respectively, for corn, cotton, and soybean. NO flux increased exponentially with soil temperature when soil water content was not limiting [> 30% Water Filled Pore Space (%WFPS)]. During conditions when soil water content was limiting, NO flux was inhibited and had no relationship with soil temperature. Above a value of 30% WFPS, increasing soil water content had no effect on NO emissions (the upper limit of %WFPS could not be estimated due to a lack of data in this regime). Below 30% WFPS, increasing soil moisture increased NO production and lower soil moistures led to decreased NO flux. Increased nitrogen fertilization rates led to higher NO fluxes. However, differences in physiological growth stages between crops confound extractable nitrogen values as decomposing root biomass in the mature corn crop added an undetermined amount of available nitrogen to the soil. Interactions between soil water content, fertilizer application, and soil temperature make it very difficult to predict day-to-day variations of NO Bur from our data. There appears to be no simple relation between NO flux and the environmental variables measured in Clayton, NC during the summer of 1994.

Agricultural soils are a major source of nitric- (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which are produced and consumed by biotic and abiotic soil processes. The dominant sources of NO and N2O are microbial nitrification and de nitrification, and emissions of NO and N2O generally increase after fertiliser application. The present study investigated the impact of N-source distribution on emissions of NO and N2O from soil and the significance of denitrification, rather than nitrification, as a source of NO emissions. To eliminate spatial variability and changing environmental factors which impact processes and results, the experiment was conducted under highly controlled conditions. A laboratory incubation system (DENIS) was used, allowing simultaneous measurement of three N-gases (NO, N2O, N-2) emitted from a repacked soil core, which was combined with N-15-enrichment isotopic techniques to determine the source of N emissions. It was found that the areal distribution of N and C significantly affected the quantity and timing of gaseous emissions and N-15-analysis showed that N2O emissions resulted almost exclusively from the added amendments. Localised higher concentrations, so-called hot spots, resulted in a delay in N2O and N-2 emissions causing a longer residence time of the applied N-source in the soil, therefore minimising NO emissions while at the same time being potentially advantageous for plant-uptake of nutrients. If such effects are also observed for a wider range of soils and conditions, then this will have major implications for fertiliser application protocols to minimise gaseous N emissions while maintaining fertilisation efficiency.

Straw return reduces yield-scaled N2O plus NO emissions from annual winter wheat-based cropping systems in the North China Plain. Straw return in combination with synthetic N fertilizer is considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield. Such practice, however, can considerably modify soil microbial activity and relative C and N availability, both of which are known to regulate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Minimizing these emissions per unit of crop yield is a prerequisite to minimize the environmental footprint of agricultural production and thus, a policy objective. In our study, we quantified N2O and NO emissions and determined fertilizer-N use efficiencies (NUE) and crop yields of two double-cropping (summer maize/Welsh onion-winter wheat) systems with and without straw incorporation in the North China Plain. Relative to the fertilized treatment without straw amendments, straw incorporation showed a significant inhibitory effect on annual N2O emissions from the maize-wheat system (-31%), but no significant effect was observed for the Welsh onion-wheat system. However, straw return significantly reduced annual NO emissions by >30% for both systems. Meanwhile, straw return in both systems significantly increased the NUE and crop yields by 34-47% and 7-16%, respectively, as compared to the treatment without straw additions. Across the double-cropping systems, annual direct emission factors of N2O, NO and N2O + NO were 0.37-0.57%, 0.08-0.78% and 0.57-1.36%, respectively. Furthermore, a negative relationship between direct emission factors of N2O + NO and crop NUE was observed, highlighting the importance of optimizing NUE for reducing environmental risks of a cropping system. When expressing emissions on a yield basis, straw return significantly reduced annual yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions by 15-42% for both systems. Overall, our results show that the combined application of crop straw and synthetic N fertilizer is a promising N management strategy for maximizing crop yields while mitigating N-trace gas emissions.

Immediate and long-term nitrogen oxide emissions from tropical forest soils exposed to elevated nitrogen input. Tropical nitrogen (N) deposition is projected to increase substantially within the coming decades. Increases in soil emissions of the climate-relevant trace gases NO and N2O are expected, but few studies address this possibility. We used N addition experiments to achieve N-enriched conditions in contrasting montane and lowland forests and assessed changes in the timing and magnitude of soil N-oxide emissions. We evaluated transitory effects, which occurred immediately after N addition, and long-term effects measured at least 6 weeks after N addition. In the montane forest where stem growth was N limited, the first-time N additions caused rapid increases in soil N-oxide emissions. During the first 2 years of N addition, annual N-oxide emissions were five times (transitory effect) and two times (long-term effect) larger than controls. This contradicts the current assumption that N-limited tropical montane forests will respond to N additions with only small and delayed increases in soil N-oxide emissions. We attribute this fast and large response of soil N-oxide emissions to the presence of an organic layer (a characteristic feature of this forest type) in which nitrification increased substantially following N addition. In the lowland forest where stem growth was neither N nor phosphorus (P) limited, the first-time N additions caused only gradual and minimal increases in soil N-oxide emissions. These first N additions were completed at the beginning of the wet season, and low soil water content may have limited nitrification. In contrast, the 9- and 10-year N-addition plots displayed instantaneous and large soil N-oxide emissions. Annual N-oxide emissions under chronic N addition were seven times (transitory effect) and four times (long-term effect) larger than controls. Seasonal changes in soil water content also caused seasonal changes in soil N-oxide emissions from the 9- and 10-year N-addition plots. This suggests that climate change scenarios, where rainfall quantity and seasonality change, will alter the relative importance of soil NO and N2O emissions from tropical forests exposed to elevated N deposition.

This practice may lead to the recovery and utilization of the nitrogen by vegetation, but it may also lead to emissions of biogenic nitric oxide (NO), which may enhance ozone pollution in the lower levels of the troposphere. Recent global estimates of biogenic NO emissions from soils are cited in the literature, which are based on held measurements of NO emissions from various agricultural and non-agricultural fields. However, biogenic emissions of NO from soils amended with biosolids are lacking. Utilizing a state-of-the-art mobile laboratory and a dynamic flow-through chamber system, in-situ concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) were measured during the spring/summer of 1999 and winter/spring of 2000 from an agricultural soil which is routinely amended with municipal waste biosolids, The average NO flux for the late spring/summer time period (10 June 1999-5 August 1999) was 69.4 +/- 34.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1).

The same field site was sampled again in late spring (2-9 June 2000) and the average flux was 64.8 +/- 41.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1). An observationally based model, developed as part of this study, found that summer accounted for 60% of the yearly emission while fall, winter and spring accounted for 20%, 4% and 16% respectively. Field experiments were conducted which indicated that the application of biosolids increases the emissions of NO and that techniques to estimate biogenic NO emissions would, on a yearly average, underestimate the NO flux from this field by a factor of 26. Soil temperature and % water filled pore space (%WFPS) were observed to be significant variables for predicting NO emissions, however %WFPS was found to be most significant during high soil temperature conditions. In the range of pH values found at this site (5.8 +/- 0.3), pH was not observed to be a significant parameter in predicting NO emissions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Soil nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions as indicators of elevated atmospheric N deposition rates in seminatural ecosystems. Elevated N deposition caused by ammonia emissions from poultry and pig farms, and supplemented N concentrations in acid mist in field and chamber experiments increased soil available NH4+ and NO3- concentrations and emissions of N2O and NO. In a 'pristine' soil, not previously exposed to high N deposition rates, an initial threshold of 40 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) was required to increase N2O emissions. For all data described here on average 0.76% (range 0.2 to 15%) of the elevated N deposited was emitted as N2O. For soils exposed to long-term and large N deposition rates N2O losses >3% of the N deposition rate were calculated. This suggests that N2O losses of more than 3% of the N input can be indicative of soil ecosystems where the N input exceeds its demand. For NO a more limited data set showed losses ranging from 1.3 to 20% of the elevated N input. It was calculated that NH3 emissions from all intensive pig and poultry farms in Great Britain accounted for 18 t N2O-N year(-1) and that poultry farms accounted for less than 3 t NO-N year(-1).

Organic-Inorganic Fertilization Sustains Crop Yields While Mitigating N2O and NO Emissions in Subtropical Wheat-Maize Systems. Balancing food security with fertilizer-driven climate impacts remains critical in intensive agriculture. While organic-inorganic substitution enhances soil fertility, its effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions remain uncertain. This study evaluated N2O/NO emissions, crop yields, and agronomic parameters in a subtropical wheat-maize rotation under four fertilization regimes: inorganic-only (NPK), manure-only (OM), and partial substitution with crop residues (CRNPK, 15%) or manure (OMNPK, 30%), all applied at 280 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Emissions aligned with the dual Arrhenius-Michaelis-Menten kinetics and revised \"hole-in-the-pipe\" model. Annual direct emission factors (EFd) for N2O and NO were 1.01% and 0.11%, respectively, with combined emissions (1.12%) exponentially correlated to soil nitrogen surplus (p < 0.01). CRNPK and OMNPK reduced annual N2O+NO emissions by 15-154% and enhanced NUE by 10-45% compared with OM, though OMNPK emitted 1.7-2.0 times more N2O/NO than CRNPK. Sole OM underperformed in yield, while partial substitution-particularly with crop residues-optimized productivity while minimizing environmental risks. By integrating emission modeling and agronomic performance, this study establishes CRNPK as a novel strategy for subtropical cereal systems, reconciling high yields with low greenhouse gas emissions.

Drip irrigation or reduced N-fertilizer rate can mitigate the high annual N2O + NO fluxes from Chinese intensive greenhouse vegetable systems. In China, most farmers intensively producing vegetables in greenhouses use frequent flooding irrigation and apply excessive amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. This results in low resource use efficiency and high environmental N losses, partly in the form of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) or of the atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO). For ensuring high vegetable productivity at lower environmental costs, it is crucial to develop efficient irrigation and fertilization strategies. Here we report on year-round measurements of N2O and NO fluxes as well as crop yields for a greenhouse cucumber cultivation, comparing common farmers' practice with two alternative managements, i.e., drip fertigation (which reduced irrigation water amount to half of that used for flood irrigation) and reduction of chemical N application by 1/3. Soils managed by farmers' practice were an important source of atmospheric N-oxides, specifically with regard to N2O. Annual emissions were 60.5 and 1.39 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, for N2O and NO, which were 2.40% and 0.05% of the applied N, respectively. Compared to the farmers' practice, N2O emission factors under drip fertigation were decreased by 41%, while NO emission factors nearly doubled. Applying lower rates of N application reduced N2O and NO emission factors by 43% and 40%, respectively. Differences in the N-oxides emission strength were primarily ascribed to changes in soil microbial N turnover processes, i.e., higher moisture conditions in soils managed by farmers' practice favored denitrification in a greater extent compared with soils fertilized by drip fertigation. We also showed that drip fertigation and reducing fertilization rates by 1/3 did not compromise vegetable yields, so that lower yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions were calculated. Therefore, the replacement of farmers' practice by drip fertigation or by reducing the amount of N applied would help to secure productivity, while reducing the climate and air quality footprint of greenhouse vegetable production.

Temporal variations of soil NO and NO2 fluxes in two typical subtropical forests receiving contrasting rates of N deposition. Soils have been widely acknowledged as important natural sources of nitric oxide (NO) and meanwhile sinks of nitric dioxide (NO2). High nitrogen deposition across South China could potentially result in large NO emissions from subtropical forests soils there. In this study, the dynamic chamber method was applied to monitor NO and NO2 fluxes at two subtropical forest sites in South China, namely \"Qianyanzhou\" (QYZ) and \"Tieshanping\" (TSP). Chronically higher N deposition occurred at TSP than that at QYZ. Besides soil water filled pore spaces (WFPS) and temperature, ambient NO concentration could also possibly be important in regulating temporal NO emissions, especially in the winter. For both sites, the optimum soil temperature was above 25 degrees C, while the optimum WFPS for NO release at QYZ was higher (65-70%) than that at TSP (<23%). Moreover, heavy rainfall could trigger NO emission pulses from moist soils at QYZ, while rainfall-induced NO pulses were only observed after a long drying period at TSP. Distinctly different contents of mineral nitrogen and soil moisture conditions between the two sites might induce the divergent preference of WFPS and responses to rainfall. The cumulative soil emission of NO reached 0.41 +/- 0.01 and 0.76 +/- 0.01 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at QYZ and TSP, contributing to 2.5% and 1.4% of the annual throughfall N input, respectively. At both sites, NO2 were mainly deposited to soils, accounting for 2% and 21% of soil-emitted NO at QYZ and TSP, respectively. The observed annual NO emissions at these two sites were larger than the median values observed for tropical and temperate forests and unfertilized croplands. Higher N deposition could induce larger NO emission potential, while soil temperature and pH might also be important in regulating regional soil NO emissions as N-loss from subtropical forests.

Abiotic reactions drive post-wetting soil emissions of N2O and NO and contribute partially to CO2 emissions. Pulse emissions of soil trace gases (carbon dioxide: CO2, nitrous oxide: N2O, and nitric oxide: NO) following the wetting of dry soils may contribute disproportionately to total annual trace gas emissions in drylands. These pulses are driven by coupled biotic-abiotic processes that are challenging to partition. Here we measured soil trace gases emissions after the wetting of gamma-irradiated and live intact cores of soils with different soil C and N pools, exchangeable cations, and microbial activity. For all soils, the emissions pulse of CO2 and N-oxides was measured within 5 min of wetting. Post-wetting CO2 emission pulses from the live soils were approximately twice as large as those from the gamma-irradiated soils and were correlated with soil C content. However, the gamma-irradiated soil emitted up to 5 times more N2O and up to 13 times more NO compared with the live soil and emissions were correlated with soil N content. After normalization against the soil inorganic N content, the immediate post-wetting N2O and NO emissions were the same from the live and gamma-irradiated soils. The dependence of the post-wetting N2O and NO burst on substrate pools, regardless of the presence of live microbes, suggests an abiotic origin of immediate post-wetting fluxes.

Biogenic nitric oxide emissions upscaling: An approach for Zimbabwe. A mechanistic upscaling scheme was developed to estimate temporal nitric oxide [NO] emissions from soils for three distinct land use classes by spatial extrapolation of laboratory measurements for Zimbabwe (383,667 km(2)). Laboratory measurements on miombo woodland, grassland, and agricultural Zimbabwean soils were used to derive moisture- and temperature-dependent NO emission algorithms. By combining monthly fields of modeled soil moisture and temperature (based on climate means, vegetation indices, soil, and terrain elevation data) a mean monthly soil NO flux, including rainfall-induced elevated flux events (pulsing), was obtained. Countrywide emission rates ranged from 0.1-0.4 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for the dry season to wet season mean fluxes of 3.7-9.4 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for miombo, 4.4-7.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for grassland, and 4.6-10.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for agriculture. Annual net soil NO emissions (less canopy reduction) for Zimbabwe were 32.9 Gg N yr(-1), with miombo woodlands (66% of Zimbabwe) contributing 63% to the regional NO budget. Rainfall-induced NO pulsing contributed an additional 14% to countrywide annual bulk NO emissions. The majority of these pulses occurred during the first half of the rainy season (November-December), with agricultural soils contributing the most and grassland soils contributing the least to pulsing. The upscaling approach provided a first countrywide estimate of spatiotemporal soil NO emissions for a hitherto largely unresolved source: the soil-moisture-limited African subtropical savannas.

N2O and NO emissions by agricultural soils with low hydraulic potentials. N2O and NO production were studied on five agricultural soils with low hydraulic potentials. All experiments were performed in a laboratory under standard incubation conditions to limit any intrinsic soil heterogeneity. The mechanisms involved in NO and N2O production was investigated using the inhibitory properties of acetylene on nitrification and N2O reduction. This work confirmed that N2O and NO could be produced by soils under aerobic conditions. Nitrification seemed to be the only process involved in NO production and the main process involved in N2O production by the five studied soils when the water content was low. Nevertheless, aerobic denitrification with N2O release was observed in one soil. The proportion of N emitted as NO and N2O through nitrification varied considerably from soil to soil and, in some soils, also varied with soil hydraulic potential, ranging from 0 to 2.5%, and from 0.03 to 1%, respectively. This study clearly shows that both NO emission and the gaseous N emitted in aerated conditions should be taken into account in determining the N-budget on cultivated soils.

Biogenic nitric oxide emission from saline sodic soils in a semiarid region, northeastern China: A laboratory study. It is well-known that nitric oxide ( NO) is an important component in nitrogen biogeochemical cycling produced through biological process of nitrification and denitrification in soils, but the production and the consumption processes of NO in sodic saline soil are less understood. Through a series of laboratory experiments focusing on NO biogenic emissions from four kinds of saline sodic soils of different land use in western Songnen Plain northestern China, we found that the optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO production and emission were 14.0%, 9.0%, 9.5%, and 18% water-filled pore space (WFPS) for soil samples from natural pasture, man-made pasture, paddy field of saline sodic soil mixed sandy soil, and paddy field of pure saline sodic soil, respectively. For a given moisture, NO fluxes increased exponentially with soil temperature at any given soil moisture. The optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO emission for a certain soil type, however, was constant and independent of soil temperature. The NO consumption processes for different land uses were similar in all studied saline sodic soils since the difference of NO consumption rate constant in these soils was small ( ranged from 1.07 x 10(-6) to 7.45 x 10(-6) m 3 kg(-1) s(-1)). The NO emission potential for paddy field soils was about 1.2-2-fold higher than pasture soils. On the basis of laboratory results and field monitoring data of soil water content and soil temperature, the average NO fluxes from these saline sodic soils in the region were estimated to be 1.3-4.9 ng m(-2) s(-1) for an entire plant growth period. NO fluxes for pastures mainly occurred in the dry season and were about threefold higher than that for paddy fields, which was strongly influenced by field management.

HONO Emissions from Soil Bacteria as a Major Source of Atmospheric Reactive Nitrogen. Abiotic release of nitrous acid (HONO) in equilibrium with soil nitrite (NO2-) was suggested as an important contributor to the missing source of atmospheric HONO and hydroxyl radicals (OH). The role of total soil-derived HONO in the biogeochemical and atmospheric nitrogen cycles, however, has remained unknown. In laboratory experiments, we found that for nonacidic soils from arid and arable areas, reactive nitrogen emitted as HONO is comparable with emissions of nitric oxide (NO). We show that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria can directly release HONO in quantities larger than expected from the acid-base and Henry's law equilibria of the aqueous phase in soil. This component of the nitrogen cycle constitutes an additional loss term for fixed nitrogen in soils and a source for reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere.

The underestimated role of plant root nitric oxide emission under low-oxygen stress. The biotic release of nitric oxide (NO), a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere contributes to climate change. In plants, NO plays a significant role in metabolic and signaling processes. However, little attention has been paid to the plant-borne portion of global NO emissions. Owing to the growing significance of global flooding events caused by climate change, the extent of plant NO emissions has been assessed under low-oxygen conditions for the roots of intact plants. Each examined plant species (tomato, tobacco, and barley) exhibited NO emissions in a highly oxygen-dependent manner. The transfer of data obtained under laboratory conditions to the global area of farmland was used to estimate possible plant NO contribution to greenhouse gas budgets. Plant-derived and stress-induced NO emissions were estimated to account for the equivalent of 1 to 9% of global annual NO emissions from agricultural land. Because several stressors induce NO formation in plants, the actual impact may be even higher.

Acidification and nitrification inhibition of manure alters greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen cycling in diverse agricultural soils. Manure amendments are widely used in agriculture to enhance crop productivity and maintain soil organic matter, but they also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and reactive nitrogen (N) losses. Manure acidification and nitrification inhibitors (NIs) have been proposed as mitigation strategies, but their effectiveness likely varies with soil characteristics. To evaluate the influence of acidified and NI-treated manure on N cycling across different soil types, we conducted a 28-day laboratory incubation using soils collected from major agricultural regions in Wisconsin. We measured emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O ), nitric oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4), along with soil ammonium (NH4 +) and nitrate (NO3 (-)) dynamics. Acidified manure enhanced short-term NH4 + retention in all soils but increased cumulative N2O emissions in the sandy soil compared to untreated manure, likely due to pH-driven disruption of nitrification and incomplete denitrification. In contrast, the NI dicyandiamide (DCD) consistently suppressed nitrification early in the incubation, resulting in significantly lower N2O and NO emissions, often approaching levels observed in the no-manure controls, particularly in the sandy soil. Manure amendments increased CO(2)fluxes relative to the no-manure controls, but acidified manure emitted less CO(2)than DCD-treated manure, likely due to temporary suppression of microbial respiration. CH4 emissions were minimal and largely unaffected by treatments. NIs offer consistent benefits in reducing N2O and NO losses, while acidification can increase these emissions in certain soil conditions, highlighting the importance of tailoring management practices to specific soil characteristics. Plain Language Summary Farmers use manure to improve soil health and crop growth, but it can also releasegreenhouse gases and nitrogen into the environment. Two strategies have been proposed to limit these losses: acidifying manure and adding nitrification inhibitors(NIs). In a 28-day lab study using soils from across Wisconsin, we tested how thesetreatments affected greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen cycling. Acidified manurehelped soils hold more ammonium but increased nitrous oxide emissions in sandysoils, while the NI treatment (dicyandiamide) consistently reduced nitrous oxide andnitric oxide emissions, often to levels close to soils without manure. Manure addi-tions increased carbon dioxide release, although acidified manure gave off less thanNI-treated manure, and methane emissions were very low across all treatments. Over-all, NIs were effective in cutting nitrogen gas losses, while acidification sometimesincreased emissions depending on soil type, showing that manure management needsto be tailored to specific soil types.

N2O and NO production and functional microbes responding to biochar aging process in an intensified vegetable soil. Vegetable soils with high nitrogen input are hotspots of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), and biochar amended to soil has been documented to effectively decrease N2O and NO emissions. However, the aging effects of biochar on soil N2O and NO production and the relevant mechanisms are not thoroughly understood. A(15)N tracing microcosm study was conducted to clarify the responses of N2O and NO production pathways to the biochar aging process in vegetable soil. The results showed that autotrophic nitrification was the predominant source of N2O production. Biochar aging increased the O-containing functional groups while lowering the aromaticity and pore size. Fresh biochar enhanced the AOB-amoA gene abundance and obviously stimulated N2O production by 15.5% via autotrophic nitrification and denitrification. In contrast, field-aged biochar markedly weakened autotrophic nitrification and denitrification and thus decreased N2O production by 17.0%, as evidenced by the change in AOB-amoA and nosZI gene abundances. However, the amendment with artificially labaged biochar had no effect on N2O production. With the extension of aging time, biochar application reduced the soil NO production dominated by nitrification. Changes in the N2O and NO fluxes were closely associated with soil NH4+-N and NO2--N contents, indicating that autotrophic nitrification played a critical role in NO production. Overall, our study demonstrated that field-aged biochar suppressed N2O production via autotrophic nitrification and denitrification by regulating associated functional genes, but not for lab-aged biochar or fresh biochar. These findings improved our insights regarding the implications of biochar aging on N2O and NO mitigation in vegetable soils.

The role of different exogenous NO concentrations on C and N biogeochemistry of an agricultural soil. The signaling compound nitric oxide (NO) might play an important, yet unquantified role in mediating soil biogeochemical Carbon and Nitrogen cycles. This study quantified the effects of different soil-typical exogenous NO concentrations on the microbial community, on fertilizer N turnover, and on C and N trace gas fluxes of agricultural soil. For this, we repeatedly established soil NO concentrations of either 0, 200, 400, and ppbv-NO in soil mesocosms for in total of 12 days, followed by high-resolution automated measurements of CO2, NO, CH4, and N2O fluxes, molecular analysis of microbial community composition and 15N-isotope-tracing based assessment of fertilizer N turnover. We found no effects of different NO levels on microbial communities and CO2, CH4, and NO fluxes. However, at 200 ppbv concentration, exogenous NO promoted microbial assimilation of fertilizer N. In contrast, at 400 ppbv-NO concentration, microbial biomass N was reduced, and microbial uptake of fertilizer N was inhibited, accompanied by a 33% reduction of N2O emissions. This suggested a promoting effect of 200 ppbv-NO on the physiology of cells involved in heterotrophic microbial N turnover, probably reinforcing the role of cell-endogenous NO. In contrast, the higher exogenous NO concentrations of 400 ppbv seemed to inhibit heterotrophic microbial inorganic N assimilation, with however no increase in N2O emissions due to detoxification mechanisms. In conclusion, our pioneering study provides first insights into impacts of exogenous NO on soil C and N biogeochemistry in natural soil systems and reveals a NO concentration-dependent regulation of microbial N retention.

The nitric oxide (NO) flux from eastern North Carolina soils subjected to flooding from hurricanes were studied in laboratory experiments. Three sites along the Neuse River basin in eastern North Carolina that sustained different intensities of flooding in September 1999 from Hurricane Floyd were examined. Hurricane Floyd impacted the Neuse River basin by inducing flooding that damaged and disabled hog (Sus scrofa) lagoons and municipal wastewater treatment plants. Between approximately 53 and 325 million liters (14 and 86 million gallons) of untreated hog waste and between approximately 5.7 and 34.4 billion liters (1.5 and 9.1 billion gallons) of untreated municipal wastewater are projected to have entered the Neuse River basin, increasing the concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and total solids. Phosphorus and total solids are projected to have increased 3.2 and 199.2 mg/L, respectively. Total N was projected to have increased by 9.8 mg/L, which is posited to have increased the NO flux from flooded soils for months after the hurricane. Nitric oxide emissions from soil can adversely affect ozone levels in the lower troposphere. Minimization of NO flux from soil is advantageous, protecting air quality as well as conserving valued nitrogen fertilizers. Hurricane-loaded soils were found to produce more than 30 times greater NO emissions than nonflooded soils with NO fluxes ranging from 0.1 to 102.5 ng N/(m(2) s).

Interannual and seasonal variabilities in soil NO fluxes from a rainfed maize field in the Northeast China. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a critical role in atmospheric chemistry and also is a precursor of nitrate, which affects particle matter formation and nitrogen deposition. Agricultural soil has been recognized as a main source of atmospheric NO. However, quantifying the NO fluxes emitted from croplands remains a challenge and in situ long-term measurements of NO are still limited. In this study, we used an automated sampling system to measure NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over two years (April 2017 to March 2019) from a rainfed maize field in the Northeast China. The cumulative annual NO emissions were 8.9 and 2.3 kg N ha-1 in year 1 (April 2017 to March 2018) and year 2 (April 2018 to March 2019), respectively. These interannual differences were largely related to different weather conditions encountered. In year 1, a month-long drought before and after the seeding and fertilizing reduced plant N uptake and dramatically increased soil N concentration. The following moderate rainfalls promoted large amount of NO emissions, which remained high until late September. The NO fluxes in both years showed clearer seasonal patterns, being highest after fertilizer application in summer, and lowest in winter. The seasonal patterns of NO fluxes were mainly controlled by soil available N concentrations and soil temperatures. The contribution of NO fluxes during the spring freeze-thaw in both years was no more than 0.2% of the annual NO budget, indicating that the freeze-thaw effect on agricultural NO emissions was minimal. In addition, with high-resolution monitoring, we found that soil not only act as a NO source but also a sink. Longterm and high-resolution measurements help us better understand the diurnal, seasonal, and annual dynamics of NO emissions, build more accurate models and better estimate global NO budget and develop more effective policy responses to global climate change.

Nutrient amendments and inhibition experiments were used to evaluate factors controlling the production of N trace gases in soils. Sampling was conducted at five sites which form a 200-4.5 x 10(6) y chronosequence in Hawaiian montane rainforest. The pattern of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux from soils in the laboratory was similar to that observed in the field, with emissions of NO + N2O increasing with soil age. Autoclaving of soils indicated that there was little or no abiological production of N2O. The response of N2O and NO flux to sieving and acetylene addition is consistent with N trace gas production being primarily denitrification-based in all but the oldest site, where nitrification-based production is significant. All the soils had increased emissions of N2O in response to additions of N. Soils from the 185,000-y-old Kohala site, however, had the lowest proportional N2O response, did not have elevated NO emissions in response to addition of N, and had a small, but significant NO response to addition of carbon. This intermediate-age site represents a transition stage in soil development in which N trace gas production is the least limited by N-availability.

Soil was tilled 12 days and 2 days prior to fertiliser application. Tillage, time of tillage, and N fertiliser application affected NO and N2O emissions. Tillage 12 days before the start of the flux measurements resulted in higher emissions than tillage one day before, the difference being related to differences in soil mineral N and water-filled pore space (WFPS). Emissions of NO peaked at a WFPS of 50-60%, while N2O fluxes peaked at 70-90% WFPS. Loss of N was greater as N2O than as NO. The total loss of N as N2O plus NO ranged from 0.027 kg N ha(-1) in unfertilised plots to 0.56 kg N ha(-1) in the tilled and N fertilised plot. Thereafter emissions decreased rapidly to low values. The results of this study indicate that tillage of perennial grassland may release large amounts of NO and N2O, the amounts also depending on moisture conditions and addition of N fertiliser. We suggest that in order to reduce such emissions, application of N fertiliser should not immediately follow tillage of perennial grassland, as there is an extra supply of N from mineralisation of organic matter at this time.

Nonlinear response of soil nitric oxide emissions to fertilizer nitrogen across croplands. Nitric oxide (NO), as a short-lived climate forcer, has direct and indirect detrimental impacts on environmental quality and human health. The amount of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application to agricultural soils is considered a robust predictor of total NO emissions, but the estimates of cropland NO emissions have large uncertainties due to the widely used constant emission factors (EF) as e.g., default values recommended by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodologies. By compiling 223 field experiments with at least three N-input levels across various croplands, we performed a meta-analysis to determine how soil NO emissions respond to N inputs. Our results showed for the first time that the mean change in EF per unit of additional N input (triangle EF) across all available data was significantly higher as compared to zero, indicating that the NO response to N additions increased significantly faster than the assumed linear. On average, upland grain crops showed significantly higher triangle EF than that of horticultural crops or lowland rice. A higher triangle EF was also appeared in sites with mean annual precipitation < 600 mm, mean annual temperature >= 15 degrees C, soil organic carbon >= 14 g C kg(- 1) or total N >= 1.4 g N kg(- 1), and where synthetic N fertilizers were usually applied. By assuming various N application rates, the IPCC default (0.7% or 1.1%) EF model would have overestimated or underestimated NO emissions compared to our triangle EF model. Overall, our meta-analysis results exert high potential to improve estimates of cropland NO inventories, and help address disparities in global NO budgets and develop more targeted mitigation efforts.

Stand age amplifies greenhouse gas and NO releases following conversion of rice paddy to tea plantations in subtropical China. Increasing demand of commercial markets for tea products is driving the conversion from rice paddies to tea plantations in subtropical China. So far, however, little is known on how this land-use change, along with the age of plantation establishment, will affect the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHG) methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and the air-pollutant nitric oxide (NO). Thus, we measured CH4, N2O and NO fluxes over an entire year from two tea plantations (one- and five-year-old plantations) and a native rice-fallow system under two system specific nitrogen fertilizer options. On an annual scale, comparable or higher GHG emissions were measured for tea plantations as compared to the rice-fallow system. Besides the pollution swapping from CH4 being the dominating GHG in rice paddies to N2O in tea plantations, annual NO emissions increased significantly. Annual direct emission factors of N2O and NO in tea plantations were 2.47-5.80% and 2.00-3.99%, respectively, significantly higher than in the rice-fallow system (N2O: 1.05-2.05%; NO: 0.033-0.051%). Differences in N fertilizer inputs and soil environmental conditions (e.g., soil water regime, pH and organic carbon) due to contrasting managements of these systems and their interactions are clearly driving the stimulation of N2O and NO emissions and contributing to the significant CH4 reductions. Furthermore, we observed that increasing tea stand age, particularly under organic fertilization, further stimulated N2O and NO emissions that varied significantly intraannually. Nevertheless, the higher N2O and NO emissions of tea plantations and the increasing emission strength with stand age deserve further research attention and consideration for future land-use conversions.

Nitric oxide emission from intensively managed agricultural soil in North Carolina. Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) were determined from an intensively managed agricultural soil near Plymouth, in the coastal plain of North Carolina, using the dynamic chamber technique. The measurements were made over a soybean field from July 15 to August 15, 1996, as part of the project Natural Emissions of Oxidant Precursors: Validation of Techniques and Assessment (NOVA). A N-containing fertilizer was applied at the middle of the experiment in order to investigate the effect of N-fertilizers on NO emissions and to test the response of instruments. Soil water content was high during the experimental period, with water-filled pore space ranging from 49% to 67%. NO emission during this period ranged between 0.28 and 18.45 ng N m(-2) s(-1) with an overall average of 5.01 +/- 3.03 ng N m(-2) s(-1). A normal diurnal pattern with low values at nighttime and high values during the day was observed during the prefertilization period, but a reverse diurnal pattern (high at nighttime, low in daytime) of NO emission variation was found during the postfertilization, closed-canopy period, implying that interaction among canopy development, application of fertilization, and soil parameters may affect the diurnal variation of NO emission from soils. The emissions of NO were related to soil temperature, water-filled pore space, and extractable nitrogen. Application of fertilizer at the middle of the experiment was found to disrupt the normal relations between NO emission and soil temperature and water content seen during the prefertilization period bur to enhance the positive relation between NO emission and extractable N. An intercomparison of the dynamic chamber technique with the eddy-correlation technique in this experiment indicates that in spite of large differences in the magnitudes of soil NO emission and the NO flux at 5 m, the two fluxes show similar variations with time and are strongly correlated.

Modeling global annual N2O and NO emissions from fertilized fields - art. no. 1080. [1] Information from 846 N2O emission measurements in agricultural fields and 99 measurements for NO emissions was used to describe the influence of various factors regulating emissions from mineral soils in models for calculating global N2O and NO emissions. Only those factors having a significant influence on N2O and NO emissions were included in the models. For N2O these were (1) environmental factors (climate, soil organic C content, soil texture, drainage and soil pH); (2) management-related factors (N application rate per fertilizer type, type of crop, with major differences between grass, legumes and other annual crops); and (3) factors related to the measurements (length of measurement period and frequency of measurements). The most important controls on NO emission include the N application rate per fertilizer type, soil organic-C content and soil drainage. Calculated global annual N2O-N and NO-N emissions from fertilized agricultural fields amount to 2.8 and 1.6 Mtonne, respectively. The global mean fertilizer-induced emissions for N2O and NO amount to 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively, of the N applied. These overall results account for the spatial variability of the main N2O and NO emission controls on the landscape scale. C1 Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands.

Simultaneous quantification of greenhouse gas and nitric oxide emissions from subtropical conventional vegetable systems: a 2-site field case study in Sichuan Basin. Quantification of greenhouse gases [nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4)] and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from subtropical conventional vegetable systems through multi-site field measurements are needed to obtain accurate regional and global estimates. N2O, NO and CH4 emissions from subtropical conventional vegetable systems were simultaneously measured at two different sites with hilly topography in the Sichuan basin, southwest China by using the static chamber gas chromatography technique. Results showed that annual soil N2O and NO fluxes for the treatment receiving N fertilizer ranged from 6.34-7.71 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.69-0.85 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, while decreased soil CH4 uptakes by 26.4% as compared with no N fertilizer addition across our two sites of experiment. Overall, the average direct N2O and NO emission factor (EFd) were 0.71% and 0.12%, respectively, which were both lower than the available EFd for subtropical conventional vegetable systems. This finding indicates that current regional and global estimates of N2O and NO emissions from vegetable fields are likely overestimated. Background N2O emissions (3.42-3.62 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) from the subtropical conventional vegetable systems were relatively high as compared with available field measurements worldwide, suggesting that background N2O emissions cannot be ignored for regional estimate of N2O emissions in subtropical region. Nevertheless, the significantly intra- and inter-annual variations in N2O, CH4 and NO emissions were also observed in the present study, which could be explained by temporal variations of environmental variables (i.e. soil temperature and moisture). The differences in N2O and NO EFd and CH4 emissions between various vegetable systems in particular under subtropical conditions should be taken into account when compiling regional or global inventories and proposing mitigation practices.

Over 60 published papers reporting field measurements of emissions of nitric oxide (NO) from soil are reviewed, and over 100 annual estimates of NO emissions were made for various types of ecosystems, including agricultural fields. These data were stratified by biome and the mean of each stratum was multiplied by an estimate of the biome area. A few strata were identified as clearly having low NO emissions: montane forests, swamps and marshes, tundra, and temperate forests that are not heavily affected by N deposition. The largest emissions were observed in tropical savanna/woodland, chaparral, and cultivated agriculture, but variation in NO emissions within these strata was also large. Although the stratification scheme fails to partition this within-stratum variation, it does clearly identify these biomes as globally important sources of NO and as areas where more research is needed to investigate within-biome variation in NO emissions. It is too early to tell whether differences in NO emissions between temperate and tropical agriculture are significant, but it is clear that agriculture is an important source of NO and that management practices affect NO emissions. The best current estimate of the global soil source of NO is 21 Tg N yr(-1). Adsorption of NO, onto plant canopy surfaces may reduce emissions to the atmosphere to as low as 13 Tg N yr(-1), although the absorption effect is probably smaller than this. An error term for the global estimate is difficult to determine, but it is at least +/-4 and perhaps as large at +/-10 Tg N yr(-1). Hence, only modest progress has been made in narrowing uncertainties in the estimate of the global soil source of NO, although some published lower estimates appear unlikely. This inventory reconfirms that the soil source of NO is similar in magnitude to fossil fuel emissions of NOx. Further narrowing of the uncertainty of the estimate of global soil NO emissions will require more sophisticated and carefully chosen stratification schemes to address variation within biomes based on soil fertility, soil texture, climate, and management and will require linking this type of inventory and stratification with mechanistic models. greenhouse gases; nitrogen; NOx; nitrous oxide; ozone precursors; trace gases", "SOIL-WATER CONTROLS ON AEROBIC SOIL EMISSION OF GASEOUS NITROGEN-OXIDES. SOIL-WATER CONTROLS ON AEROBIC SOIL EMISSION OF GASEOUS NITROGEN-OXIDES. Soil water content has multiple effects on the emission of gaseous N oxides. To separate and characterize these effects, we monitored rates of CO2, NO, and N2O evolution and changes in inorganic N concentrations of soil under a factorial combination of three N treatments and three water treatments during a 10-day laboratory incubation study. Because the emission of NO from control and NH4NO3-amended soil varied with the rate of chemoautotrophic NH4+ oxidation and was virtually eliminated by a specific inhibitor of that process [nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)-pyridine)], we concluded that nitrification was the principal NO source over the entire tested range of soil water potentials ( - 10 to less than - 1000 kPa). Denitrification made no significant contribution to N oxide emissions from even the wettest soil, so nitrifiers were probably also responsible for the much smaller emission of N2O under all treatments. Slower ps diffusion in soil with highest, compared to lowest, water content caused a 3-fold reduction in the mean NO:NO3- product ratio of nitrification, suggesting that the NO produced by NH4+-oxidizers is further oxidized unless conditions permit its rapid escape to the atmosphere. Nitrapyrin also eliminated the brief burst of N oxide emissions that typically follows wetting of dry soil, indicating that chemoautotrophic NH4+ oxidation is also involved in this phenomenon despite the poor correlation of the burst's magnitude With soil NH4+ or NO2- concentrations. A second burst of N oxide emissions from control or NH4NO3-amended soil with no inhibitor occurred only where desiccation reduced both NO and CO2 evolution to near zero prior to rewetting the soil after a 7-day drying cycle.

Maximum emissions of NO and N2O were measured from the agricultural soils shortly after fertiliser application (7 ng N2O-N m-2 s-1 and 91 ng N2O-N m-2 s-1). For the non-agricultural soils the NO flux ranged from -0.3 to 0.5 ng N2O-N m-2 s-1 and the N2O flux ranged from 1 to 2.7 ng N2O-N m-2 s-1. Emissions, however, were increased 2 to 7 fold when N deposition (uplands) and N fixation (alder plantations) contributed to the pool of soil available N. The best predictors of the NO emission were soil NO3- and soil temperature, accounting for 60% of the variability observed. The prediction of N2O was less successful. Only 30% of the variability could be explained by the soil NO3- and the soil moisture content, soil temperature did not have a significant effect on the N2O emission.

Machine learning-based estimation and mitigation of nitric oxide emissions from Chinese vegetable fields. High fertilizer input and nitric oxide (NO) emissions characterize the intensive vegetable production system. However, the amount, geographic distribution, and effective mitigation strategies of NO emissions over Chinese vegetable fields remain largely uncertain. In this study, we developed a data-driven estimate of NO emissions and their spatial pattern in Chinese vegetable fields based on the Random Forest (RF) model. Additionally, we conducted a field experiment in a subtropical vegetable field to investigate the effect of climate-smart practices on NO emissions. The RF model results showed that soil NO emissions from Chinese vegetable fields were sensitive to nitrogen application amount, soil clay content, and pH. The total NO emission from Chinese vegetable fields in 2018 was estimated to be 75.9 Gg NO-N. The urgency to reduce NO emissions in vegetable fields was higher in northern than in southern China. Our meta-analysis and field experiment results suggested that biochar amendment and replacing chemical fertilizers with bio-organic fertilizers were win-win climate-smart management practices for mitigating NO emissions while improving vegetable production. Overall, our study provided new insights into NO emissions in vegetable soil ecosystems and can facilitate the development of regional NO emission inventories and effective mitigation strategies. These findings highlight the importance of adopting sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices to reduce NO emissions and mitigate their adverse environmental impacts.

A Meta-Analysis Study on the Use of Biochar to Simultaneously Mitigate Emissions of Reactive Nitrogen Gases (N2O and NO) from Soils. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are detrimental reactive gaseous oxides of nitrogen. Excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers in cropping systems has significantly increased the emissions of these gases, causing adverse environmental consequences. Previous studies have demonstrated that biochar amendment can regulate soil-N dynamics and mitigate N losses, but they lacked simultaneous assessments of soil N2O and NO emissions. Thus, the factors influencing the emissions of nitrogen oxides are still unclear. Therefore, this study examined the impact of biochar application on simultaneous N2O and NO emissions based on 18 peer-reviewed papers (119 paired observations). A machine learning model (boosted regression tree model) was adopted to assess the potential influencing factors, such as soil properties, biochar characteristics, and field management conditions. The addition of biochar reduced N2O and NO emissions by 16.2% and 14.7%, respectively. Biochar with a high total carbon content and pH, from woody or herbaceous feedstock, pyrolyzed at a high temperature, applied at a moderate rate and to soil with a high-silt content, a moderate pH, and coarse texture, could simultaneously reduce soil N2O and NO emissions. Biochar amendment, thus, has the potential to lower the environmental impact of crop production. Furthermore, the influence of soil properties, biochar characteristics, and field management should be considered in the future to enhance the efficacy of biochar.

Differential Pulse Sensitivity of Nitric and Nitrous Oxide Emissions to Temperature, Carbon, and Nitrogen Following Wetting of Desert Soils. Infrequent soil wetting in deserts can induce large nitrogen (N) trace gas pulses; however, how other abiotic mechanisms interactively control the timing and magnitude of these pulses are not clear. In particular, production of nitric(NO) and nitrous (N2O) oxide may be differentially sensitive to temperature, carbon (C), and N availability. At a desert field site in Southern California, USA, we used an automated sensor system in 4 years of field campaigns to track NO and N2O pulse responses to experimental manipulations of C and N across a range of ambient temperatures and shrub fertile islands. We observed rapid onset and shorter duration of N2O pulses immediately after wetting compared to lagged and extended pulses of NO, suggesting preferential incorporation of N initially into N2O in anoxic microsites and then to NO as soils dry. We identified strong nitrogen limitation and exponential temperature dependence of NO pulses, particularly for soils located under shrubs. N2O pulses were less responsive to experimental manipulations but showed evidence of C and N colimitation as well as seasonal temperature differences. As atmospheric N deposition and temperatures continue to increase in desert systems, we can expect larger losses of N from soils as pulse-based emissions.

Precipitation legacies amplify ecosystem nitrogen losses from nitric oxide emissions in a Pinyon-Juniper dryland. Climate change is increasing the variability of precipitation, altering the frequency of soil drying-wetting events and the distribution of seasonal precipitation. These changes in precipitation can alter nitrogen (N) cycling and stimulate nitric oxide (NO) emissions (an air pollutant at high concentrations), which may vary according to legacies of past precipitation and represent a pathway for ecosystem N loss. To identify whether precipitation legacies affect NO emissions, we excluded or added precipitation during the winter growing season in a Pinyon-Juniper dryland and measured in situ NO emissions following experimental wetting. We found that the legacy of both excluding and adding winter precipitation increased NO emissions early in the following summer; cumulative NO emissions from the winter precipitation exclusion plots (2750 +/- 972 mu g N-NO m(-2)) and winter water addition plots (2449 +/- 408 mu g N-NO m(-2)) were higher than control plots (1506 +/- 397 mu g N-NO m(-2)). The increase in NO emissions with previous precipitation exclusion was associated with inorganic N accumulation, while the increase in NO emissions with previous water addition was associated with an upward trend in microbial biomass. Precipitation legacies can accelerate soil NO emissions and may amplify ecosystem N loss in response to more variable precipitation.

Spring thaw pulses decrease annual N2O emissions reductions by nitrification inhibitors from a seasonally frozen cropland. Nitrification inhibitors (NIs) have been widely demonstrated to reduce soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from nitrogen (N)-fertilized croplands. However, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of NIs during the cold nongrowing season, especially the spring thaw - a period that may dominate the annual emissions. We conducted an experiment to examine the effects of three types of NIs (DCD, DMPP, and nitrapyrin) on soil N2O and NO emissions from a seasonally frozen cropland in northeast China in two experimental years with contrasting snowfall. In 2017-2018, DCD significantly decreased growing season N2O emissions by 54%, DMPP achieved a non-significant reduction of 32% but nitrapyrin had no inhibition effect. In the winter following this growing season, there was high snowfall and large pulses of N2O fluxes during spring thaw were observed across all treatments totaling 1.1-4.2 kg N ha(-1) and contributing 54-76% of annual emissions. NIs did not significantly affect the spring thaw emissions, which partly offset the decreased emissions during growing season, leading to an overall neutral effects of DCD and DMPP on N2O emissions when accounting for a complete year. In 2018-2019, there was less snowfall and spring thaw N2O emissions totaled just 0.32-0.64 kg N ha(-1) and contributed to only 13-40% of annual emissions. All three types of NIs significantly decreased the annual N2O emissions by 37-55%. Yet, this annual reduction was lower than that during the growing season (56-66%) due to the inefficacy of NIs to abate the spring thaw emissions. In particular, nitrapyrin significantly increased the spring thaw N2O emissions by 81% probably owing to higher residual fertilizer-N and carbon availibility. In contrast to N2O, NO fluxes during spring thaw were negligible in all years, and NIs application significantly decreased the annual NO emissions by 68-86% (except for nitrapyrin in 2017-2018). Low NO/N2O ratios and positive relationships of N2O fluxes with soil moisture and nitrate suggested that freeze-thaw induced N2O production mainly from denitrification, which might be stimulated by soil moisture from melting snow. Overall, our results highlight that changes in winter weatherO fluxes have been attributed to several mechanisms: physical release of the conditions, and particularly snow dynamics, could create large uncertainties in assessing the efficacy of soil N-oxide emissions mitigation strategies under climate change.

Nitric Oxide Emission Following Wetting of Dry Soils in Subtropical Humid Forests. Information about soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions from subtropical forests is quite limited, and even less is known about the pulse emission of NO when wetting soils after a long period of dryness. In this study, we measured NO fluxes following wetting of dry soil in a broadleaf forest and a pine forest in subtropical China. Large pulses of NO fluxes were observed after soil wetting in both forests. NO fluxes increased significantly within 0.5 h following wetting in both forests and reached peak 1 and 4 h after soil wetting in the pine forest and the broadleaf forest, respectively. In the broadleaf forest, averaged peak flux of NO pulses was 157 ng N m(-2) s(-1), which was 8 times the flux value before wetting, and in the pine forest, the averaged peak flux was 135 ng N m-2 s-1, which was 15.5 times the flux value before wetting. The total pulses-induced NO emissions during the dry season were roughly estimated to be 29.4 mg N m(-2) in the broadleaf forest and 22.2 mg N m(-2) in the pine forest or made up a proportion of 4.6% of the annual NO emission in the broadleaf forest and 5.3% in the pine forest.

Climate warming reduces soil gaseous nitrogen losses in a temperate forest. Global warming is projected to accelerate ecosystem nitrogen (N) loss via gaseous pathways, thereby decreasing N availability, a critical nutrient for primary productivity and carbon sequestration. However, the models forecasting this ecosystem N loss are based on laboratory experiments that are inherently uncertain and have had few in situ validations. Over 6 y, we measured similar to 200,000 soil nitric oxide (NO; an air pollutant) and nitrous oxide (N2O; a powerful greenhouse gas) fluxes and used an upscaling approach to estimate N-2 fluxes after warming a temperate forest by 2 degrees C. Against thermodynamic theoretical predictions, warming unequivocally lowered emissions of NO by 19% and of N2O by 16%. These lower gaseous N losses were not explained by complete reduction of NO and N2O to N-2, leaching, nor plant uptake, but rather by the warming-induced drying of soils that constrained microbial activity, consistent with other warming experiments where precipitation was less than 1,000 mm y(-1). Our findings challenge ecosystem model assumptions where warming, alone, accelerates N emissions and underscores how warming-induced losses in soil moisture and shortened freeze-thaw periods can offset temperature effects. Our data underscore the need for explicit consideration of in situ soil moisture when predicting changes on the terrestrial N cycle as the planet warms.

Testing the hole-in-the-pipe model of nitric and nitrous oxide emissions from soils using the TRAGNET database. Because several soil properties and processes affect emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) from soils, it has been difficult to develop effective and robust algorithms to predict emissions of these gases in biogeochemical models. The conceptual \"hole-in-the-pipe\" (HIP) model has been used effectively to interpret results of numerous studies, but the ranges of climatic conditions and soil properties are often relatively narrow for each individual study. The Trace Gas Network (TRAGNET) database offers a unique opportunity to test the validity of one manifestation of the HIP model across a broad range of sites, including temperate and tropical climates, grasslands and forests, and native vegetation and agricultural crops. The logarithm of the sum of NO + N(2)O emissions was positively and significantly correlated with the logarithm of the sum of extractable soil NH,+ + NO(3)(-). The logarithm of the ratio of NO:N(2)O emissions was negatively and significantly correlated with water-filled pore space (WFPS). These analyses confirm the applicability of the HIP model concept, that indices of soil N availability correlate with the sum of NO+N(2)O emissions, while soil water content is a strong and robust controller of the ratio of NO:N(2)O emissions. However, these parameterizations have only broad-brush accuracy because of unaccounted variation among studies in the soil depths where gas production occurs, where soil N and water are measured, and other factors. Although accurate predictions at individual sites may still require site-specific parameterization of these empirical functions, the parameterizations presented here, particularly the one for WFPS, may be appropriate for global biogeochemical modeling. Moreover, this integration of data sets demonstrates the broad ranging applicability of the HIP conceptual approach for understanding soil emissions of NO and N(2)O.

Nitrogen Availability and Changes in Precipitation Alter Microbially Mediated NO and N2O Emissions From a Pinyon-Juniper Dryland. Climate change is altering precipitation regimes that control nitrogen (N) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. In ecosystems exposed to frequent drought, N can accumulate in soils as they dry, stimulating the emission of both nitric oxide (NO; an air pollutant at high concentrations) and nitrous oxide (N2O; a powerful greenhouse gas) when the dry soils wet up. Because changes in both N availability and soil moisture can alter the capacity of nitrifying organisms such as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) to process N and emit N gases, predicting whether shifts in precipitation may alter NO and N2O emissions requires understanding how both AOA and AOB may respond. Thus, we ask: How does altering summer and winter precipitation affect nitrifier-derived N trace gas emissions in a dryland ecosystem? To answer this question, we manipulated summer and winter precipitation and measured AOA- and AOB-derived N trace gas emissions, AOA and AOB abundance, and soil N concentrations. We found that excluding summer precipitation increased AOB-derived NO emissions, consistent with the increase in soil N availability, and that increasing summer precipitation amount promoted AOB activity. Excluding precipitation in the winter (the most extreme water limitation we imposed) did not alter nitrifier-derived NO emissions despite N accumulating in soils. Instead, nitrate that accumulated under drought correlated with high N2O emission via denitrification upon wetting dry soils. Increases in the timing and intensity of precipitation that are forecasted under climate change may, therefore, influence the emission of N gases according to the magnitude and season during which the changes occur.

Preliminary results on nitric oxide emission from a southern African savanna ecosystem. During October to December 1994, we measured diel and seasonal variability in nitric oxide (NO) exchange by a southern African savanna ecosystem (Grasslands Research Station, Marondera, Zimbabwe). A set of automated dynamic chambers was installed in three sub-sites: Miombo forest, natural grassland, and cropped soils (maize, sorghum, groundnut). The latter received a single application of commercialy available in-organic or cowdung fertilizer. The dynamic chamber system is described in detail, including correction of the resulting data for wall losses and gas-phase reactions of the NO-NO2-O-3 triad. During the dry season, net vertical NO fluxes were close to the detection limit (0.44 ngN m(-2)s(-1)) regardless of vegetation type. During the transition from dry to wet season strong ''pulsing'' effects of the NO flux were observed: NO emissions increased by a factor of up to 60 within hours. During the wet season, NO emissions varied between the different sub-sites of the ecosystem; corresponding means are in ranking order of fertilized agricultural plots (27.2 ngN m(-2) s(-1)), unfertilized agricultural plots (8.5 ngN m(-2) s(-1)), grassland (4.4 ngN m(-2) s(-1)), and Miombo forest (1.5 ngN m(-2) s(-1)). Soil moisture was found to be the dominant factor controlling the NO fluxes. Whenever it was not limiting, the diel behaviour of NO emission followed the daily variation of soil temperature measured 1 cm below the surface.

Measurement of nitrogen oxide emissions from an agricultural soil with a dynamic chamber system. Biogenic soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO) were measured from an intensively managed agricultural row crop (corn, Zea mays) during a 4 week period (May 15 through June 9, 1995). The site was located in Washington County, near the town of Plymouth, which is in the Lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina. Soil NO flux was determined using a dynamic flow-through chamber technique. The measurement period was characterized by two distinguishing features: an application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer at the midpoint of the experiment and a nontypical rainfall pattern. Average NO flux prior to the application of N fertilizer was 31.5 +/- 10.1 np N m(-2) s(-1), and more than doubled (77.7 +/- 63.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) after the application of a side-dressing of N fertilizer. Average soil extractable nitrogen values did not change significantly following application of the side-dressing of N fertilizer. We attribute this failure to detect a significant difference in soil extractable nitrogen following N fertilization to the method in which the fertilizer was applied, the subsequent rainfall pattern, and the technique of soil sampling. NO flux followed the same diurnal trend as soil temperature, with maximum NO emissions coinciding with maximum soil temperature, and minimum NO emissions coinciding with minimum soil temperature. NO flux was found to increase exponentially with soil temperature, but only after fertilization. Due to subsurface irrigation practices employed by the farmer, changes in soil water content were minimal, and no relation could be drawn between soil water content and NO flux. Simultaneous measurements of NOy, NO2, and NO emissions revealed that NO and NO2 emissions represent 86 and 8.7%, respectively, of NOy emissions leaving the soil. Simultaneous NO flux measurements made by a closed box flux technique, at the same site, revealed no statistically significant differences between the two different methodologies for measuring NO flux.

Tillage and crop residue management significantly affects N-trace gas emissions during the non-rice season of a subtropical rice-wheat rotation. Field operations of tillage and residue incorporation could have potentially important influences on N-trace gas fluxes, though poorly quantified. Here we studied the effects of straw incorporation in the preceding rice season and no-tillage prior to wheat sowing on nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during the non-rice period of a typical rice-wheat rotation in the Yangtze River Delta. Compared to conventional management practice (no straw incorporation along with rotary harrowing tillage to 10 cm before wheat sowing), straw incorporation alone decreased cumulative N2O emissions over the entire non-rice period by 32% (1.53 vs. 2.24 kg N ha(-1), P < 0.05) but did not affect NO emissions (0.88 vs. 0.87 kg N ha(-1)). In contrast, no-tillage alone increased N2O emissions by 75% (P < 0.05) while reducing NO emissions by 48% (P < 0.01). Combination of no-tillage and straw incorporation led to no change in N2O emissions but a reduction in NO emissions compared to the conventional management regime. The direct N2O emission factors (EF(d)s) of applied nitrogen fertilizers during the non-rice season ranged from 0.29% to 1.35% with a coefficient of variation (CV) as large as 68% among the investigated management regimes. The EF(d)s for NO ranged from 0.13% to 0.32% with a CV of 50%. Adoption of these new EFds will allow us to account for management effects on N-trace gas emissions when calculating emission inventories. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the uncertainty remains high, since the effects of soil properties such as texture or pH on management practices are not yet well defined. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantification of N2O and NO emissions from a small-scale pond-ditch circulation system for rural polluted water treatment. The pond-ditch circulation system(PDCS) is an efficient and economical solution for the restoration of degraded ruralwater environments. However, little is known about nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions in the microbial removal process of nitrogen in PDCSs, and their contribution to nitrogen removal. The aim of this study was to quantify N2O and NO emissions from the PDCS, evaluate their capacities, and elucidate the key environmental factors controlling them. The results showed that N2O and NO fluxes were in the ranges 1.1-2055.1 mu g Nm(-2) h(-1) and 0.1-6.8 mu g Nm(-2) h(-1) for the PDCS, respectively. Meanwhile, the N2O and NO fluxes from the two ponds in the PDCS were significantly higher than those in the static system. Moreover, the amount of N2O and NO emissions in the PDCS accounted for 0.17-4.32% of the total nitrogen (TN) removal. According to the partial least squares (PLS) approach and Pearson's correlation coefficients, nitrate nitrogen in water (W-NO3-N), dissolved oxygen in water (W-DO), dissolved oxygen in sediment (DO), pH in water (W-pH), pH in sediment (pH), total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and soil organic carbon (SOC) significantly affected the N2O flux (p < 0.05), whereas W-NO3--N, DO, and nitrite nitrogen in sediment (NO2--N) significantly affected the NO emission (p < 0.05).

Methane exchanges were small (<+/-0.03 mu g CH4 m(-2) min(-1)) and overall absorption equalled or exceeded emission in both soils. On the clay loam, wetting with water or urine increased soil microbial biomass C and N contents by about 20% but there was no specific effect of urine.

Emissions of nitric and nitrous oxides following urine application were substantial (on average 0.36 mu g NO-N and 29 mu g N2O-N m(-2) min(-1)) but short lived (<40 days). The high levels of ammonium found in the urine treated soils (>200 mg NH4+-N kg(-1)) were nitrified to nitrate over a period of 42 days.

Soil nitric and nitrous oxide emissions across a nitrogen fertilization gradient in root crops: A case study of carrot (Daucus carota) production in Mediterranean climate. Insufficient knowledge about soil nitrous and nitric oxide (N2O and NO) emissions from vegetable production limits our ability to constrain their atmospheric budget. Carrots (Daucus carota) are a globally important, heavily managed and irrigated, high-value horticultural crop. Although intensively fertilized carrots may be an important hot-spot source of N2O and NO emissions, we have little information on the response of soil N2O emissions to fertilization and no information on the NO emissions response. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a replicated field experiment on mineral soil in the Negev Desert. We grew carrots with drip irrigation, applying five fertilization levels, ranging between 0 and 400 kg N ha(-1). During one growth season we estimated responses of the soil N2O and NO emissions, partial crop N balance, and carrot yields to incremental fertilization levels. Carrot yield increased with increasing fertilization from 0 to 100 kg N ha(-1) and exhibited no further response thereafter. Soil N2O and NO emissions were similar at all fertilization levels and did not differ significantly from those in the unfertilized control. The estimated N budget was negative for all fertilization levels. Carrots incorporated 30-140 kg N ha(-1) into their belowground biomass and 120-285 kg N ha(-1) into their aboveground biomass per season.

Results showed that the average total N2O and NO emissions in the CRF treatment in the pot and field experiments decreased by 26.5 and 19.4%, respectively. The average N2O and NO emission factors decreased by 32.1 and 24.8%, respectively, compared with the CF treatment.

CONTROLS ON NITRIC-OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM TROPICAL PASTURE AND RAIN-FOREST SOILS. In field studies, forest soils in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Pica emitted greater amounts of nitric oxide (NO) than soils from pastures that had been actively grazed for over 20 years following their conversion from forest. We measured NO production from intact soil cores from these land uses. Laboratory tests using ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), water, and acetylene (C2H2) additions demonstrate a response consistent with field studies. Forest soil cores produced more NO than pasture cores regardless of treatment. In forest soil the response to NH4+ solution was significantly greater than response to water or an ambient moisture control. Addition of 10 kPa C2H2 caused a marked decrease in NO production in forest soil cores. These responses suggest a nitrification-linked control over NO production. Large and rapid responses to NO2- additions suggest that chemical decomposition of this ion may contribute to NO production. Pasture soil cores did not show a significant response to any of the treatments including NO2-. Low porosity in the pasture soils may restrict emission of NO produced therein.

N2O and NO production in various Chinese agricultural soils by nitrification. Eleven types of agricultural soils were collected from Chinese uplands and paddy fields to compare their N2O and NO production by nitrification under identical laboratory conditions. Before starting the assays, all air-dried soils were preincubated for 4 weeks at 25 degreesC and 40% WFPS (water-filled pore space). The nitrification activities of soils were determined by adding (NH4)(2)SO4 (200 mg N kg(-1) soil) and incubating for 3 weeks at 25 degreesC and 60% WFPS. The net nitrification rates obtained fitted one of two types of models, depending on the soil pH: a zero-order reaction model for acidic soils and one neutral soil (Group 0); or a first-order reaction model for one neutral soil and alkaline soils (Group 1). The results suggest that pH is the most important factor in determining the kinetics of soil nitrification from ammonium. In the Group 1 soils, initial emissions (i.e. during the first week) of N2O and NO were 82.6 and 83.6%, respectively, of the total emissions during 3 weeks of incubation; in the Group 0 soils, initial emissions of N2O and NO were 54.7 and 59.9%, respectively, of the total emissions. The net nitrification rate in the first week and second-third weeks were highly correlated with the initial and subsequent emissions (i.e. during the second and third weeks), respectively, of N2O and NO.

Quantifying the contribution of land use to N2O, NO and CO2 fluxes in a montane forest ecosystem of Kenya. Increasing demand for food and fibre by the growing human population is driving significant land use (LU) change from forest into intensively managed land systems in tropical areas. But empirical evidence on the extent to which such changes affect the soil-atmosphere exchange of trace gases is still scarce, especially in Africa. We investigated the effect of LU on soil trace gas production in the Mau Forest Complex region, Kenya. Intact soil cores were taken from natural forest, commercial and smallholder tea plantations, eucalyptus plantations and grazing lands, and were incubated in the lab under different soil moisture conditions. Soil fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were quantified, and we approximated annual estimates of soil N2O and NO fluxes using soil moisture values measured in situ. Forest and eucalyptus plantations yielded annual fluxes of 0.3-1.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) and 1.5-5.2 kg NO-N ha(-1) a(-1). Soils of commercial tea plantations, which are highly fertilized, showed higher fluxes (0.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) and 4.3 kg NO-N ha(-1) a(-1)) than smallholder tea plantations (0.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) and 2.1 kg NO-N ha(-1) a(-1)) or grazing land (0.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) and 1.1 kg NO-N ha(-1) a(-1)). High soil NO fluxes were probably the consequence of long-term N fertilization and associated soil acidification, likely promoting chemodenitrification. Our experimental approach can be implemented in understudied regions, with the potential to increase the amount of information on production and consumption of trace gases from soils.

This work is a unique investigation of NOy fluxes on a landscape scale, taking a comprehensive set of land-use types, human influence, and seasonality into account to determine large-scale heterogeneity to provide a basis for future modeling and hypothesis generation. By coupling 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we have linked significant differences in functional potential and activity of nitrifying and denitrifying soil microbes to NOy emissions from soils. Further, we have identified soils subject to increased N deposition that are less microbially active despite increased available N, potentially as a result of poor soil health from anthropogenic pollution. Structural equation modeling suggests human influence on soils to be a more significant effector of soil NOy emissions than land-use type.

An inventory of nitric oxide emissions from soils in China. The emission of NO was parameterized using empirical relationships with landuse type, fertilization rate and soil temperature. Eight landuse types (including four arable lands) were considered. Fertilization rates were distinguished for different regions and crops. A typical summer period of July in 1999 was chosen for detailed calculations. The total NO emission in the July is 141.1 Gg N, with 73.7% from arable lands and 22.0% from grasslands. The highest emission intensity can be more than 40 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in the heavily fertilized North China Plain, and the average of the whole lands is 6.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1). The annual emission was roughly estimated to be 657 Gg N, about 11.7% of the global total (5600 Gg N, reported by IPCC in 2000), and about 12.5% of the anthropogenic origin in China.

Nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, and methane fluxes from soils following clearing and burning of tropical secondary forest. Conversion of humid tropical forest to agriculture significantly alters trace gas emissions from soils. We report nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), and methane (CH4) fluxes from secondary forest soils prior to and during deforestation, and throughout the first agricultural cropping. Annual average nitrogen oxide emissions from forest soils were 1.5 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for N2O and 0.9 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for NO. Forest clearing increased the level of extractable nitrate in soils and average nitrogen oxides fluxes (2.7 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for N2O, and 8.1 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for NO). Immediately after biomass burning, short-term peaks of N2O and NO (123 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for N2O, and 41 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for NO) were superimposed on generally increased fluxes. Peak emissions declined within 3 days after burning. Postburn fluxes stayed higher than measured on adjacent forest sites for 3-4 months (averages for postburn fluxes were 17.5 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for N2O, and 19.2 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for NO). Increased N2O and NO emissions after clearing and until cropping were probably due to a combination of increased rates of nitrogen cycling and higher gaseous diffusion in drying soils. Compared to emissions from young pastures in the region, fluxes of nitrogen oxides from unfertilized agricultural areas were low (3.9 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for N2O and 3.4 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for NO), probably due to nitrogen uptake by fast growing corn plants and losses by leaching with draining soil water in the wet season. Variation in CH4 fluxes was high for ail land use periods. Forest soils consumed an average of 1.0 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), which slightly increased in drier soils after clearing (1.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Postburn CH4 consumption by soils was slightly reduced (0.8 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) compared to forest soils. Unfertilized agricultural soils consumed less CH4 than forest soils.

Contribution of biogenic nitric oxide in urban ozone: Raleigh, NC, as a case study. Anthropogenic emissions from industrial and automotive sources within the confines of the city of Raleigh, NC have been documented by the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources, Division of Environmental Management, but no direct biogenic emissions of nitric oxide (NO) from soils has yet been measured. In this study, emissions of NO were measured in Raleigh, NC, and its surrounding suburbs, in an attempt to determine the portion of the total NOx (= NO + NO2) budget which can be attributed to biogenic sources. Residential and commercial lawns, and golf courses receiving normal fertilizer applications were chosen as the primary biogenic source of NO. Soil NO fluxes were measured using a dynamic chamber technique from 11 sites and ranged in value (hourly averages calculated from 15 min readings) from 1.24 to 23.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1). These hour averages were then combined with estimates of lawn acreage within the city proper, and in the surrounding suburbs, in order to develop a budget for biogenic NO emissions in Raleigh. This budget was then compared to the budget used in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regional Oxidant-Model (ROM) for photochemical modeling. Results from this comparison suggest that less than 1% of the total NOx budget for Raleigh, NC is emitted by natural processes, and that approximately 1.2% of the nitrogen applied as fertilizer is lost via soil NO emissions. Thus, the effects of biogenic NO may be neglected in the development of a reliable plan for reducing ozone in the urban atmosphere. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Biogenic nitric oxide emissions from cropland soils. Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) were determined during late spring and summer 1995 and the spring of 1996 from four agricultural soils on which four different crops were grown. These agricultural soils were located at four different sites throughout North Carolina. Emission rates were calculated using a dynamic flow-through chamber system coupled to a mobile laboratory for in-situ analysis. Average NO fluxes during late spring 1995 were: 50.9 +/- 47.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) from soil planted with corn in the lower coastal plain. Average NO fluxes during summer 1995 were: 6.4 +/- 4.6 and 20.2 +/- 19.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively, from soils planted with corn and soybean in the coastal region; 4.2 +/- 1.7 nq N m(-2) S-1 from soils planted with tobacco in the piedmont region; and 8.5 +/- 4.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1) from soils planted with corn in the upper piedmont region.

An apparent increase in NO flux with soil temperature was present at all of the locations. The composite data from all the research sites revealed a general positive trend of increasing NO flux with soil water content.

Unusually high soil nitrogen oxide emissions influence air quality in a high-temperature agricultural region. Fertilized soils have large potential for production of soil nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO+NO2), however these emissions are difficult to predict in high-temperature environments. Understanding these emissions may improve air quality modelling as NOx contributes to formation of tropospheric ozone (O-3), a powerful air pollutant. Here we identify the environmental and management factors that regulate soil NOx emissions in a high-temperature agricultural region of California. We also investigate whether soil NOx emissions are capable of influencing regional air quality. We report some of the highest soil NOx emissions ever observed. Emissions vary nonlinearly with fertilization, temperature and soil moisture. We find that a regional air chemistry model often underestimates soil NOx emissions and NOx at the surface and in the troposphere. Adjusting the model to match NOx observations leads to elevated tropospheric O-3. Our results suggest management can greatly reduce soil NOx emissions, thereby improving air quality. C1 [Oikawa, P.

Characteristics of annual N2O and NO fluxes from Chinese urban turfgrasses. Urban turfgrass ecosystems are expected to increase at unprecedented rates in upcoming decades, due to the increasing population density and urban sprawl worldwide. However, so far urban turfgrasses are among the least understood of all terrestrial ecosystems concerning their impact on biogeochemical N cycling and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes. In this study, we aimed to characterize and quantify annual N2O and NO fluxes from urban turfgrasses dominated by either C4, warm-season species or C3, cool-season and shadeenduring species, based on year-round field measurements in Beijing, China. Our results showed that soil N2O and NO fluxes varied substantially within the studied year, characterizing by higher emissions during the growing season and lower fluxes during the non-growing season. The regression model fitted by soil temperature and soil water content explained approximately 50%-70% and 31%-38% of the variance in N2O and NO fluxes, respectively. Annual cumulative emissions for all urban turfgrasses ranged from 0.75 to 1.27 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O and from 0.30 to 0.46 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for NO, both are generally higher than those of Chinese natural grasslands. Non-growing season fluxes contributed 17%-37% and 23%-30% to the annual budgets of N2O and NO, respectively. Our results also showed that compared to the cool-season turfgrass, annual N2O and NO emissions were greatly reduced by the warm-season turfgrass, with the high root system limiting the availability of inorganic N substrates to soil microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification. This study indicates the importance of enhanced N retention of urban turfgrasses through the management of effective species for alleviating the potential environmental impacts of these rapidly expanding ecosystems.

Nitrogen use efficiency exhibits a trade-off relationship with soil N2O and NO emissions from wheat-rice rotations receiving manure substitution. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer has shown to affect soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions that contribute to global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. However, soil N2O and NO emissions with a linkage to crop N use efficiency (NUE) under different fertilization strategies in winter wheat-summer rice rotation systems remain yet to be further examined. Here, we carried out a two-year field study to assess the response of soil N2O and NO emissions as an interplay with NUE to different fertilization strategies in a typical winter wheat-summer rice rotation cropland of subtropical China. Three fertilizer treatments were established consisting of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer application (PK), NPK fertilizer application (NPK), and NPK fertilizer application with N partially replaced with manure (NPKM). Annual N2O, NO and N2O + NO emissions averaged 0.96, 0.24 and 1.19 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the PK plots and 6.54, 1.48 and 8.03 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the NPK plots, respectively. Relative to the NPK plots, partially replacing chemical N fertilizer with manure decreased annual N2O and NO emissions and their combined emissions by 13-15%, while it significantly enhanced crop NUE as compared to the NPK plots. Annual mean emission factors (EFs) of N fertilizer for N2O and NO were estimated to be 1.17% and 0.26% for the NPK plots, and 0.99% and 0.22% for the NPKM plots, respectively. Both N2O and NO emissions were positively correlated with N surplus, while yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions and the fertilizer N-induced combined EF for N2O + NO were negatively related to crop NUE. Together, our results highlight that improving crop NUE while reducing soil N surplus constitutes an effective strategy to mitigate soil gaseous N loss through N2O and NO in the wheat-rice rotation cropping systems.

Soil N-oxide emissions decrease from intensive greenhouse vegetable fields by substituting synthetic N fertilizer with organic and bio-organic fertilizers. In order to reduce soil and environmental quality degradation associated with the use of synthetic nitrogen (N), substituting chemical fertilizer with organic or bio-organic fertilizer has become an increasingly popular option. However, components of this fertilizer strategy related to mitigation of soil N-oxide emissions and maintenance of crop yield remain uncertain. Here, we evaluated the effects of three different fertilizer strategies, with equal amounts of N, on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, vegetable yield, and yield-scaled N2O and NO emissions under three consecutive cucumber growing seasons. The three treatments were chemical fertilizer (NPK, urea), organic fertilizer (O, composted cattle manure), and bio-organic fertilizer (O + T, O combined with Trichoderma.spp). Results showed that the NPK plot had the highest area-scaled emissions of N2O (13.1 +/- 0.48 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and NO (5.01 +/- 0.34 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), which were 1.3-1.4 and 3.1-3.7 times greater than the O and O + T plots, respectively. The annual direct emission factors for N2O and NO were 2.08% and 0.92% for the NPK plot, which declined to 1.34% and 0.09% in the O plot, and 1.12% and 0.03% in the O + T plot, respectively. The annual vegetable yield was 117 +/- 2.9 t ha(-1) for NPK plot and 122 +/- 2.0 t ha(-1) for O + T plot, which was higher than 111 +/- 1.7 t ha(-1) for O plot. The yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions differed significantly with fertilization treatment, with the lowest value observed in the O + T plot. We attributed the lower soil N-oxide emissions following organic fertilizer application to the slow release of available N and enhanced denitrification caused by the increase of soil dissolved organic carbon and pH. Compared with the use of organic fertilizer alone, the addition of Trichoderma.spp significantly increased the potential denitrification rate but decreased N2O emissions, which may have promoted the reduction of N2O to N-2. Therefore, our results suggest that adopting composted organic fertilizer mixtures with microbial inoculants could be a win-win practice to mitigate gaseous N losses and simultaneously improve crop yield in intensively managed vegetable cropping systems.

Response of nitric and nitrous oxide fluxes to N fertilizer application in greenhouse vegetable cropping systems in southeast China. It is of great concern worldwide that active nitrogenous gases in the global nitrogen cycle contribute to regional and global-scale environmental issues. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are generally interrelated in soil nitrogen biogeochemical cycles, while few studies have simultaneously examined these two gases emission from typical croplands. Field experiments were conducted to measure N2O and NO fluxes in response to chemical N fertilizer application in annual greenhouse vegetable cropping systems in southeast China. Annual N2O and NO fluxes averaged 52.05 and 14.87 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) for the controls without N fertilizer inputs, respectively. Both N2O and NO emissions linearly increased with N fertilizer application. The emission factors of N fertilizer for N2O and NO were estimated to be 1.43% and 1.15%, with an annual background emission of 5.07 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 1.58 kg NO-N ha(-1), respectively. The NO-N/N2O-N ratio was significantly affected by cropping type and fertilizer application, and NO would exceed N2O emissions when soil moisture is below 54% WFPS. Overall, local conventional input rate of chemical N fertilizer could be partially reduced to attain high yield of vegetable and low N2O and NO emissions in greenhouse vegetable cropping systems in China.

Seasonal characteristics of nitric oxide emission from a typical Chinese rice-wheat rotation during the non-waterlogged period. Nitric oxide emissions from a typical rice-wheat rotation system in southeastern China were continuously measured with an automatic system in 1996-1997. The seasonal pattern of the NO emissions was characterized for the non-waterlogged period of a rotation cycle. Nitric oxide emissions during the period from March through June were 3.9-6.3 folds for the fertilized plots and 1.6 folds for the unfertilized plot larger than those from November through December. Nitric oxide emissions were not detectable during the winter period from January through February. Amendment of synthetic fertilizer N significantly enhanced the NO emission by a factor of 6.5, but the enhancement was significantly mitigated by 25% through substituting ca. 16% of the synthetic fertilizer N with organic N from fermented crop residues or by 21% through deep tillage. The NO-N emission factor, defined as the amount of NO-N released per unit of synthetic fertilizer N input, was determined to be 0.025 kg NO-N kg (-1) of N applied for the non-waterlogged period, which was reduced by 32% through substituting part of the synthetic N fertilizer with fermented crop residues or by 24% through deep tillage. In addition, the NO emission factor, defined as the amount of NO-N emitted from unit unfertilized area per day, was observed to be ca. 3.8 g N ha (-1) d (-1) .

A European-wide inventory of soil NO emissions using the biogeochemical models DNDC/Forest-DNDC. Soils are a significant source for atmospheric NO. However, due to the limited number of measurements and in view of the high temporal and spatial variability of NO emissions, as originating from dependencies from a series of environmental constraints such as soil properties, meteorology or N fertilization, inventories of soil NO emissions are still highly uncertain. In this work, the agricultural DNDC model was modified and applied on site scale in order to evaluate its capability to simulate soil NO emissions. DNDC captured differences in the magnitude of NO emissions between sites, but was less successful when simulating observed day-by-day variations. However, major peak emission events, e.g. due to fertilizer application or following rainfall events, were mostly simulated. DNDC as well as its forest version Forest-DNDC were finally linked to a GIS to calculate NO emissions from agricultural and forest soils across Europe. Using the same databases for agricultural soils, we also compared our estimate with other commonly used methodologies (Skiba-EMEP/CORINAIR, Yienger and Levy, Stehfest and Bouwman). A canopy reduction factor was not applied in this study. Estimates for NO emissions for agricultural soils for EU15 states varied in a range of 48.9-189.8 kt NO-N for the year 2000 depending on the approach used (Yienger and Levy > DNDC > Stehfest and Bouwman > Skiba-EMEP/CORINAIR). For forests, using the model Forest-DNDC as the only approach, we calculated soil NO emissions to be 75.1 kt NO-N yr(-1). The results show that soils in EU15 states are significant sources of atmospheric NOx though the share of soil NO emissions on total NOx emissions (incl. NOx emissions by combustion processes) in EU15 was only 4-6%. Given that soil NO emissions are largely driven by the availability of inorganic nitrogen (fertilization) and temperature, emissions are larger during the vegetation period. Especially during early summer when fertilizer-induced NO emissions from agricultural soils are peaking, the contribution of soil emissions to total NOx emissions may most likely be well above 10%.

Mechanistic representation of soil nitrogen emissions in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model v 5.1. Soils are important sources of emissions of nitrogen-containing (N-containing) gases such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrous acid (HONO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia (NH3). However, most contemporary air quality models lack a mechanistic representation of the biogeo-chemical processes that form these gases. They typically use heavily parameterized equations to simulate emissions of NO independently from NH3 and do not quantify emissions of HONO or N2O. This study introduces a mechanistic, process-oriented representation of soil emissions of N species (NO, HONO, N2O, and NH3) that we have recently implemented in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The mechanistic scheme accounts for biogeochemical processes for soil N transformations such as mineralization, volatilization, nitrification, and denitrification. The rates of these processes are influenced by soil parameters, meteorology, land use, and mineral N availability. We account for spatial heterogeneity in soil conditions and biome types by using a global dataset for soil carbon (C) and N across terrestrial ecosystems to estimate daily mineral N availability in nonagricultural soils, which was not accounted for in earlier parameterizations for soil NO. Our mechanistic scheme also uses daily year-specific fertilizer use estimates from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC v0509) agricultural model. A soil map with sub-grid biome definitions was used to represent conditions over the continental United States. CMAQ modeling for May and July 2011 shows improvement in model performance in simulated NO2 columns compared to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite retrievals for regions where soils are the dominant source of NO emissions. We also assess how the new scheme affects model performance for NOx (NO + NO2), fine nitrate (NO3) particulate matter, and ozone observed by various ground-based monitoring networks. Soil NO emissions in the new mechanistic scheme tend to fall between the magnitudes of the previous parametric schemes and display much more spatial heterogeneity. The new mechanistic scheme also accounts for soil HONO, which had been ignored by parametric schemes.

Here we report fluxes of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) over multiple seasons from three naturally N-rich, aggrading forests of coastal Oregon, USA. Mean methane uptake rates (3.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were high compared with forests globally, negatively related to water-filled pore space (WFPS), but unrelated to N availability or temperature. Emissions of NO (6.0 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)) exceeded N2O (1.4 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)), except when WFPS surpassed 55%. Spatial variation in NO fluxes correlated positively with soil nitrate concentrations (which generally exceeded ammonium concentrations, indicating the overall high N status for the sites) and negatively with soil pH, and at one site increased with basal area of N-2-fixing red alder. Combined NO and N2O emissions were greatest from the site with highest annual net N mineralization and lowest needle litterfall C/N.

An incubation experiment was carried out during 70 d to assess the influence on nitric oxide (NO) and greenhouse gas (GHG; i.e. nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane) emissions following incorporation of 4 particle size fractions, obtained through laboratorial separation from cattle slurry, to agricultural sandy loam soil (Dystric Cambisol).

The highest value of cumulated NO emissions (6.3 mg NO-N kg(-1) dry soil) were observed from the AS treatment. The cumulated amount of NO emitted (similar to 1 mg NO-N kg(-1) dry soil) was not significantly different between slurry fractions, thereby indicating that slurry particle size had no effect on NO emissions. The largest slurry fraction (>2000 pin) induced significantly higher N2O emissions (1.8 mg N2O-N kg(-1) dry soil) compared to the other smaller sized fractions (1.0 mg N2O-N kg(-1) dry soil).

Hence, for N2O, the application of WS to agricultural soil is a better option that amendment with the >2000 gm, fraction. Low CH4 emissions (<200 mu g CH4-C kg(-1) dry soil d(-1)) were observed, but only in treatments amended with slurry or its fractions. The CH4 emissions were short-lived and rates returned to control levels within 3 d after the slurry application. Higher CO2 emissions were observed in soils amended with slurry fractions when compared to application with whole slurry. Clearly, slurry separation can increase soil CO2 emissions relative to whole slurry application. Overall, N2O contributed 10-30% to total GHG emissions, while that of methane was negligible. The present study suggested that mechanical separation of slurry into fractions and targeted application of the finest fractions to soil is a potential suitable management tool to reduce GHG emissions. However, the largest fractions have to be used for other purposes as anaerobic digestion rather than applied to soil. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Role of chemical reactions in the nitrogenous trace gas emissions and nitrogen retention: A meta-analysis. Increasing evidence has been found that chemical reactions affect significantly the terrestrial nitrogen (N) cycle, which was previously assumed to be mainly dominated by biological processes. Due to the limitation of knowledge and analytical techniques, it is currently challenging to discern the contribution of biotic and abiotic processes to the terrestrial N cycle for geobiologists and biogeochemists alike. To better understand the role of abiotic reactions in the terrestrial N cycle, it is necessary to comprehend the chemical controls on nitrogenous trace gas emissions and N retention in soil under various environmental conditions. In this manuscript, we assess the role of abiotic reactions in nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions as well as N retention through a meta-analysis using all related peer-reviewed publications before August 2020. Results show that abiotic reactions contributed 29.3-37.7% and 44.0-57.0% to the total N2O emission and N retention, representing 3.7-4.7 and 4.0-6.0 Tg year(-1) of global terrestrial N2O emission and N retention, respectively. Much higher NO production was observed in sterilized soils than that in unsterilized treatments indicating the major contribution of chemical reactions to NO emission and rapid microbial reduction of NO to N2O and N-2. Chemical hydroxylamine oxidation accounts for the largest abiotic contribution to N2O emission, while chemical nitrite reduction and fixation represent for the largest contribution to abiotic NO production and soil N retention, respectively. Factors influencing the abiotic processes include pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N), and transition metals. These results broadened our knowledge about the mechanisms involved in chemical N reactions and provided a simplified estimation about their contribution to nitrogenous trace gas emission and N retention, which is meaningful to further study interactions of biologically and chemically mediated reactions in biogeochemical N cycle.

N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions from soil after the application of organic fertilizers, urea and water. Agricultural soil is a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3). Little information is available on emissions of these gases from soils amended with organic fertilizers at different soil water contents. N2O, NO and NH3 emissions were measured in large-scale incubations of a fresh sandy loam soil and amended with four organic fertilizers, [poultry litter (PL), composted plant residues (CP), sewage sludge pellets (SP) and cattle farm yard manure (CM)], urea fertilizer (UA) or a zero-N control (ZR) for 38 days. Fertilizers were added to soil at 40, 60 or 80% water-filled pore space (WFPS). The results showed that urea and organic fertilizer were important sources of N2O and NO. Total N2O and NO emissions from UA ranged from 0.04 to 0.62%, and 0.23 to 1.55% of applied N, respectively. Total N2O and NO emissions from organic fertilizer treatments ranged from 0.01 to 1.65%, and <0.01 to 0.55% of applied N, respectively. The lower N2O and NO emissions from CP and CM suggested that applying N is these forms could be a useful mitigation option. Comparison of the NO-N/N2O-N ratio suggested that nitrification was more dominant in UA whereas denitrification was more dominant in the organic fertilizer treatments. Most N was lost from PL and UA as NH3, and this was not influenced significantly by WFPS. Emissions of NH3 from UA and PL ranged from 62.4 to 69.6%, and 3.17 to 6.11% of applied N, respectively.

NO and N2O emissions from savanna soils following the first simulated rains of the season. Data on the emissions of oxides of nitrogen from the soil during the early part of the wet season are reported for nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sandy soils at Nylsvley, South Africa. The emissions of NOx and N2O following the first wetting event of the season are elevated relative to subsequent events. The observed high emission rates (76 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1)) are partially attributed to the sandiness of the soil, which permits NO to diffuse out of the soil rapidly. The pulse of high emissions following wetting is maintained for approximately 72 hours, thereafter continuing at around 20 ng NO m(-2) s(-1) while the soil remains moist. The initial pulse is suggested to be due to the accumulation of a substrate pool during the dry period, coupled with an inability of plants and microbes to use it effectively during the first few days after wetting. There were no significant differences in the peak or subsequent emission rates for either NO or N2O between two sites of differing nitrogen mineralisation potentials. N2O emissions averaged 8% of NOx emissions. The enhanced emissions of NOx which follow the first wetting after a prolonged dry period do not make a very large contribution to the annual gaseous N emission budget, but could be a significant contributor to the high tropospheric ozone levels observed over southern Africa in springtime.

Nitric oxide emissions from conventional vegetable fields in southeastern China. We conducted multi-year observations of nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from typical vegetable fields in the Yangtze River delta, which is located in southeastern China. Flux measurements were performed manually twice per week at intervals of 2-3 days, in both fertilized and unfertilized fields, over an investigation period of 1448 days (September 2004-August 2008). In total, twelve vegetable-growing periods and a short fallow period were investigated. On average, the NO fluxes from the fertilized plots were 21 times higher than fluxes from the unfertilized plots (p < 0.001). Peak NO emissions usually occurred soon after the addition of nitrogenous fertilizer. Peak emissions took place during about 15% of the whole investigation time, but contributed to approximately 89% of the total NO release. The annual background NO emissions (from fields without nitrogen amendment) were observed at 0.290 +/- 0.019 (standard deviation of 3 observations) kg N ha(-1). The total amounts of NO emitted during the individual vegetable-growing periods correlated positively and exponentially with the products of seasonal mean soil temperatures and nitrogen addition rates (R-2 = 0.87, p < 0.001). The mean direct NO emission factor (EFd, the loss rate of fertilizer nitrogen via NO emissions) for the four-year period was determined to be 0.51% +/- 0.11% (standard error of 3 observations). The EF(d)s of individual vegetable-growing seasons ranged from 0.05% to 1.24%, varying linearly and positively with the products of seasonal mean soil temperatures and nitrogen addition rates (R-2 = 0.58, p < 0.01). The observed interaction of soil temperature and nitrogen addition on NO emission in seasonal totals and EF(d)s occurred in soils with moisture contents ranging from 55% to 100% water-filled pore space (mean: 79%; standard deviation: 9%). The results of this study indicate that when other conditions remain relatively stable, the direct emission factor, a key parameter for compiling an inventory of NO emissions from vegetable fields, may vary with not only soil temperature but also nitrogen addition.

Spatial and temporal variability of soil nitric oxide emissions in N-saturated subtropical forest. Acidic subtropical forest soils, receiving high atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, are characterized by fast N turnover, making them potential \"hot spots\" for nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Production of NO in soils is mediated by microbial nitrification and denitrification and/or chemical decomposition of microbially produced nitrite (NO2-). In monsoonal forests, soil microbial processes are exposed to strong soil moisture and temperature fluctuations, known to cause pronounced variability in NO emission. We quantified in situ fluxes of NO throughout two summers in the N-saturated TieShanPing forest, Chongqing, SW China. Additional N2O measurements were carried out in the second summer to infer likely source processes. To address spatial variability, fluxes were measured along two transects, one covering well-drained Acrisols on a forested hill slope, and the other hydrologically connected terraces with poorly drained Cambisols situated in a groundwater discharge zone. Hill slope sites emitted on average 48.4 +/- 60.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) in the relatively wet summer of 2015 and 88.4 +/- 94.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) in the dry summer of 2016, illustrating the strong effect of soil moisture regime. The NO emission in the groundwater discharge zone, measured in the dry summer of 2016 only, while it was flooded in the summer of 2015, was significantly smaller (26.4 +/- 52.7 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). The mean N2O-N emission on the hillslope (18.1 +/- 13.9 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) was smaller than NO-N flux, while it was larger (38.3 +/- 39.3 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) in the groundwater discharge zone. The temporal variability of the NO flux was largely explained by soil moisture fluctuations, whereas soil organic matter pool sizes contributed most to spatial variability. Hourly measurements showed that the NO flux doubled with 8 degrees C increase of soil temperature, indicating that soil temperature was another important driver for NO emissions. Our study indicates that acid N-saturated subtropical forest soils are a large source for NO, particularly during dry summers.

Effects of nitrate concentration on the denitrification potential of a calcic cambisol and its fractions of N2, N2O and NO. The direct measurement of denitrification dynamics and its product fractions is important for parameterizing process-oriented model(s) for nitrogen cycling in various soils. The aims of this study are to a) directly measure the denitrification potential and the fractions of nitrogenous gases as products of the process in laboratory, b) investigate the effects of the nitrate (NO (3) (-) ) concentration on emissions of denitrification gases, and c) test the hypothesis that denitrification can be a major pathway of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) production in calcic cambisols under conditions of simultaneously sufficient supplies of carbon and nitrogen substrates and anaerobiosis as to be found to occur commonly in agricultural lands. Using the helium atmosphere (with or without oxygen) gas-flow-soil-core technique in laboratory, we directly measured the denitrification potential of a silt clay calcic cambisol and the production of nitrogen gas (N-2), N2O and NO during denitrification under the conditions of seven levels of NO (3) (-) concentrations (ranging from 10 to 250 mg N kg(-1) dry soil) and an almost constant initial dissolved organic carbon concentration (300 mg C kg(-1) dry soil). Almost all the soil NO (3) (-) was consumed during anaerobic incubation, with 80-88 % of the consumed NO (3) (-) recovered by measuring nitrogenous gases. The results showed that the increases in initial NO (3) (-) concentrations significantly enhanced the denitrification potential and the emissions of N-2 and N2O as products of this process. Despite the wide range of initial NO (3) (-) concentrations, the ratios of N-2, N2O and NO products to denitrification potential showed much narrower ranges of 51-78 % for N-2, 14-36 % for N2O and 5-22 % for NO. These results well support the above hypothesis and provide some parameters for simulating effects of variable soil NO (3) (-) concentrations on denitrification process as needed for biogeochemical models.

Kudzu (Pueraria montana) invasion doubles emissions of nitric oxide and increases ozone pollution. The nitrogen-fixing legume kudzu (Pueraria montana) is a widespread invasive plant in the southeastern United States with physiological traits that may lead to important impacts on ecosystems and the atmosphere. Its spread has the potential to raise ozone levels in the region by increasing nitric oxide (NO) emissions from soils as a consequence of increasing nitrogen (N) inputs and cycling in soils. We studied the effects of kudzu invasions on soils and trace N gas emissions at three sites in Madison County, Georgia in 2007 and used the results to model the effects of kudzu invasion on regional air quality. We found that rates of net N mineralization increased by up to 1,000%, and net nitrification increased by up to 500% in invaded soils in Georgia. Nitric oxide emissions from invaded soils were more than 100% higher (2.81 vs. 1.24 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1)). We used the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to evaluate the potential impact of kudzu invasion on regional atmospheric chemistry and air quality. In an extreme scenario, extensive kudzu invasion leads directly to an increase in the number of high ozone events (above 70 ppb) of up to 7 days each summer in some areas, up from 10 to 20 days in a control scenario with no kudzu invasion. These results establish a quantitative link between a biological invasion and ozone formation and suggest that in this extreme scenario, kudzu invasion can overcome some of the air quality benefits of legislative control.

Prescribed biomass burning effects on soil NO emissions in South Carolina. Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are key atmospheric trace gases that affect air quality, oxidation chemistry, and nitrogen deposition. Although anthropogenic NOx emissions have declined due to regulations, natural sources like soil emissions are becoming relatively more important. Biomass burning can alter soil nitrogen cycling and potentially influence soil NO fluxes, yet few controlled studies exist. Here, we examined how prescribed burning affects soil NO emissions in a South Carolina forest using incubation experiments. The study site is a sandhill ecosystem dominated by upland oak and longleaf pine, with fire-adapted understory vegetation including wiregrass. Soil cores were collected before and after burns of varying intensities. Measured soil pH, nitrate, and ammonium showed no consistent differences between pre- and post-burn conditions. NO fluxes, quantified using a custom soil chamber, averaged 0.056 +/- 0.068 ng-N h-1 g-1 with no significant burn-related change, and most values remained below the method detection limit of 0.137 ng-N h-1 g-1. However, ammonium nitrate additions triggered significant NO emissions, highlighting nitrogen availability as a key control. Scaling fluxes to the state level, we estimate natural forest soil contributed an estimated 700 +/- 800 metric tons of NO during a summer month, which is about 5.0 +/- 6.0% of statewide NO emissions. These results suggest that prescribed fire does not enhance soil NO emissions in nitrogen-limited, acidic southeastern U.S. forests, immediately following fire events. Moreover, they indicate that forest soil emissions are likely a minor contributor to regional NO budgets in this region.

Seasonal dynamics and profiles of soil NO concentrations in a temperate forest. Aims Soils are known to be significant sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), a key compound in atmospheric chemistry. NO is a key regulating substance for inter- and intra-species signalling and competition and affects plant growth and soil microbial metabolisms. However, little is known about NO concentration in soils and production of NO in the soil profile. Methods Here we report on soil NO concentrations down to 65 cm soil depth and soil surface flux measurements over a 15 months period in subdaily resolution. This is supplemented by information on aerobic and anaerobic NO production in various soil layers of a spruce stand in SW Germany. Results NO concentrations showed a clear seasonality with highest concentrations of up to 800 nmol mol(-1) (or part per billion in volume mixing ratio; ppbv) at the interface between the organic Of-Oh sub-layers in the summer. NO concentrations in the mineral subsoil (-65 cm) were approx. One order of magnitude lower than in the organic layer. Dynamic changes of soil NO concentrations were closely correlated with soil surface NO fluxes. Differences in soil NO concentrations across the soil profile reflected differences in aerobic and anaerobic NO production potential. Conclusion The importance of such high NO concentrations for soil microbial and plant physiological processes remains unclear, but should be addressed in future research in order to improve our understanding of microbe-microbe and plant-microbe interactions.

Biological soil crusts accelerate the nitrogen cycle through large NO and HONO emissions in drylands. Reactive nitrogen species have a strong influence on atmospheric chemistry and climate, tightly coupling the Earth's nitrogen cycle with microbial activity in the biosphere. Their sources, however, are not well constrained, especially in dryland regions accounting for a major fraction of the global land surface. Here, we show that biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are emitters of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO). Largest fluxes are obtained by dark cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts, being similar to 20 times higher than those of neighboring uncrusted soils. Based on laboratory, field, and satellite measurement data, we obtain a best estimate of similar to 1.7 Tg per year for the global emission of reactive nitrogen from biocrusts (1.1 Tg a(-1) of NO-N and 0.6 Tg a(-1) of HONO-N), corresponding to similar to 20% of global nitrogen oxide emissions from soils under natural vegetation. On continental scales, emissions are highest in Africa and South America and lowest in Europe. Our results suggest that dryland emissions of reactive nitrogen are largely driven by biocrusts rather than the underlying soil. They help to explain enigmatic discrepancies between measurement and modeling approaches of global reactive nitrogen emissions. As the emissions of biocrusts strongly depend on precipitation events, climate change affecting the distribution and frequency of precipitation may have a strong impact on terrestrial emissions of reactive nitrogen and related climate feedback effects. Because biocrusts also account for a large fraction of global terrestrial biological nitrogen fixation, their impacts should be further quantified and included in regional and global models of air chemistry, biogeochemistry, and climate.

Organic fertilizers have divergent effects on soil N2O emissions. A field experiment was conducted in a subtropical tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) plantation in Jiangsu Province, China, including the following treatments: no nitrogen (N) fertilizer (control), conventional mineral N fertilizer (urea) (CN), soybean cake fertilizer (SF), pig manure (PM), cattle manure (CaM), chicken manure (CM), and CM + biochar (CMB). Cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions were 4.8 +/- 0.1 and 3.7 +/- 0.3 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) under CN, respectively, and increased to 5.4 +/- 0.2 and 4.6 +/- 0.3 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) under SF (P < 0.05), respectively. Treatments with livestock manures (PM, CaM, and CM) reduced N2O (41.4-49.6%) and NO (46.5-59.8%) emission in comparison to CN. Combined amendment of CM and biochar more effectively reduced N2O emissions than CM treatment alone. Based on a meta-analysis of 26 global paired measurements in acid soils, the threshold of C/N ratios of organic fertilizers between the positive and negative responses of N2O emissions to organic fertilizers was 8.6 with a range of 4.5-22.3 (95% confidence interval), indicating that reduced N2O emission under PM, CaM and CM was potentially due to their C/N ratios compared to the threshold. Organic fertilizer application did not influence tea yield, while combined application of CM and biochar increased tea yield and resulted in the least yield-scaled N2O emission. N2O and NO emission factors for N fertilizers applied under CN were 1.9 +/- 0.1% and 1.5 +/- 0.2%, respectively, and reduced to 0.08 +/- 0.04% and 0.12 +/- 0.04% under CMB, respectively. The results suggest that tea plantations in the subtropical region are hotspots for N2O and NO emissions. Combined application of chicken manure and biochar could mitigate N gas emissions and increase yield in the tea plantation systems.

Biological invasion alters regional nitrogen-oxide emissions from tropical rainforests. We explored whether the invasion of an exotic, nitrogen (N) fixing tree into native Hawaiian tropical forests has altered regional emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), two atmospherically important trace gases produced by microorganisms in soils. Ecosystem processes, including nitrification and N-oxide emissions, were not affected by Morella faya (formerly Myrica faya) invasion until it dominated the community with few native species in the overstory or understory. Remote-sensing estimates of upper-canopy leaf N concentration were strongly correlated to N-oxide emissions in ecosystems at the mesic-wet end of a precipitation gradient, where temperatures are warm, relatively constant, and N limits biological processes. In contrast, remotely sensed and field-based canopy chemistry was not related to N-oxide emissions in dry forest ecosystems where the seasonality of temperature and moisture exerted stronger control over soil gas fluxes. Thus, remote sensing of canopy N was useful for estimating the impact of M. faya on regional N-oxide emissions only in regions receiving > 1800 mm rainfall annually. Our estimates of N-oxide emissions from M. faya are half as large and 35 times more precise than those made using traditional, plot-level methods of extrapolation. Over the 40 years since its first occurrence in wet forests of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, M. faya has increased N-oxide emissions 16-fold, with its effects most pronounced in summer and at the N-rich centers of dense, monospecific stands.

Soil structure and greenhouse gas emissions: a synthesis of 20 years of experimentation. Soil structure affects microbial activity and thus influences greenhouse gas production and exchange in soil. Structure is variable and increasingly vulnerable to compaction and erosion damage as agriculture intensifies and climate changes. Few studies have specifically related the impact of structure and its variability to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over a wide range of soils and management treatments. The objective of this study was to draw from research in Scotland, Japan and New Zealand, which examined how soil structures affected by wheel compaction, animal trampling, tillage and land-use change influence GHG emissions in order to help identify key controlling properties. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the main focus, though carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitric oxide (NO) are included. Gas emissions were measured by using static chambers in the field or incubated intact cores. Poor structure, measured as small relative gas diffusivities and air permeabilities, restricted aeration, resulting in N2O emission or consumption dependent on mineral nitrogen contents. Structural damage (identifiable using the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure) was especially important near the soil surface where microsites of microbial activity were exposed and aeration was impaired. Moist, well-aerated soils favoured CH4 oxidation and CO2 exchange. N2O emissions were not necessarily increased in anaerobic soils because of possible N2O consumption and microbial adaptation. Soil matric potential, volumetric water content, relative diffusivity, air permeability and water-filled pore space are relevant indicators for N2O and CH4 flux and aeration status. As pore continuity and size are so relevant, pore-scale models are likely to have an increasing role in understanding mechanisms of GHG production, transport and release.

Fluxes of nitric oxide from soils following the clearing and burning of a secondary tropical rain forest. At sites in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Rica, clearing and burning of a secondary tropical rain forest caused a significant increase in soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Soil-atmosphere NO fluxes averaged 0.5 ng N cm(-2) hr(-1) prior to clearing and increased to 4.1 ng N cm(-2) hr(-1) following clearing and to greater than 12.0 ng N cm(-2) hr(-1) following burning. Soil NO emissions were elevated for a period of 3-4 months following clearing, and fluxes peaked for 1-3 days following burning. We conducted a series of experiments with intact soil cores to determine the probable mechanism responsible for elevated NO emissions from soils. In one set of experiments we added substrates for microbial nitrification (ammonium), denitrification (nitrate), and chemical denitrification (nitrite) to autoclaved (killed) and nonautoclaved (live) soil cores. Water-only additions were used as controls. Compared to water or nitrate additions, ammonium caused a significant increase in NO emissions from live cores. Water, ammonium, and nitrate additions had no effect on emissions from autoclaved cores. Nitrite solution additions resulted in highly significant increases in NO emissions from both autoclaved and nonautoclaved soil cores. In a second set of experiments we treated intact soil cores with acetylene (1 kPa C2H2) to selectively inhibit nitrification and oxygen to inhibit denitrification. The oxygen treatment had no effect on NO production while acetylene significantly reduced NO emissions. The results from the substrate addition and inhibition experiments demonstrate that microbial denitrification is not a major pathway for NO production in these soils. In contrast, microbial nitrification appears to be a critical process responsible for NO emissions throughout the clearing and burning period. Field experiments with acetylene as an inhibitor show that immediately following burning, chemical denitrification of nitrite deposited in ash supports a large peak in NO fluxes.

Soil emissions of HONO and other nitrogen-containing gases: Insights into microbial pathways and moisture effects. Nitrous acid (HONO) greatly impacts tropospheric chemistry by producing hydroxyl radical (OH) through photolysis, and yet our knowledge about sources of HONO remains elusive. Emissions of nitrogen (N) containing gases from soils have long been a subject of research in biogeochemistry. Soil emissions of HONO have received greater attention recently, helping explain a missing source of observed atmospheric HONO. We conducted laboratory experiments to simultaneously measure emission fluxes of HONO along with other N containing gases including nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia (NH3) from lateritic red soil samples, and evaluated the contributions of microbiological processes to HONO emissions by conducting process inhibiting experiments. Results from monitoring emissions during a full wet-drying cycle showed that the emissions of HONO, NO and N2O have a strong dependance on soil water content, with maximum fluxes for HONO (125 +/- 17 ng N m(-2) s(-1)), NO (115 +/- 11 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) and N2O (453 +/- 100 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) observed at 17 % (HONO), 42 % (NO) and 94 % (N2O) water filled pore space (WFPS), respectively, while NH3 emission remains at similar to 16 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in majority of the WFPS range. Results from process inhibiting experiments suggested ammonia oxidation to be the dominant pathway for HONO production in the low water-content range, while reduction of nitrate to NO2- appeared dominant in the high water-content range. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of studying emissions of HONO along with other N containing gases as connected network of processes as a whole.

Little Effect of Land Use on N2O and NO Emission Pulses Following Rewetting of Dry Soils Across Seasonally Dry sub-Saharan Africa. In seasonally dry ecosystems, which are common in sub-Saharan Africa, precipitation after dry periods can cause large pulses of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas, and of nitric oxide (NO), a precursor to tropospheric ozone pollution. Agricultural practices can change soil characteristics, affecting trace N gas emissions. To evaluate the effects of land use on trace gas pulses at the start of the rainy season, we conducted laboratory measurements of N2O and NO fluxes from soils collected from four pairs of agricultural and natural savannah sites across the Sudano-Sahelian zone. We also conducted in situ wetting experiments, measuring NO fluxes from fallow sandy soils in Tanzania and NO and N2O fluxes from clayey soils in Kenya with different histories of fertilizer use. In incubation studies, NO increased by a factor of 7 to 25 following wetting, and N2O fluxes shifted from negative to positive; cumulative NO fluxes were an order of magnitude larger than cumulative N2O fluxes. In Kenya and Tanzania, NO increased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude after wetting, and N2O increased by a factor of roughly 5 to 10. Cumulative NO fluxes ranged from 87 to 115 g NO-N ha(-1) across both countries-a substantial proportion of annual emissions-compared to roughly 1 g N2O-N in Kenya. There were no effects of land use or fertilization history on the magnitude of NO or N2O pulses, though land use may have been confounded with differences in soil texture potentially limiting the ability to detect land use effects. Plain Language Summary In ecosystems with distinct rainy and dry seasons, the first rainfall events stimulate biological activity in soils, leading to pulsed emissions of two nitrogen-based gases from soils: nitric oxide (NO), which leads to ozone pollution, and nitrous oxide (N2O), a powerful greenhouse gas. In farms where little fertilizer is used, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, soil may become depleted of nitrogen, which could result in smaller pulses of these gases. We measured emissions of NO and N2O in the laboratory after experimentally wetting soils from natural savanna and farm sites across the Sudano-Sahelian zone. We also measured emissions of both gases at farms in Kenya and Tanzania. In both studies, emissions of NO increased by a roughly 7 to 100 times after wetting. In the field studies, total emissions during the pulses-which lasted less than a day-were equivalent to about 1/4 to 1/3 of the NO emitted during the first 2 months of the cropping season, when most of the annual NO emissions are expected to occur. Emissions of N2O also increased after wetting, but the increases were smaller. No differences in the size of the laboratory emission pulses were found between the farm and savanna soils.

A relative method for measuring nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from forest soils. Many forest ecosystems in the world are suffering from high load of nitrogen (N) deposition and acting as potential contributors to atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), which regulates the oxidative capacity of the troposphere. However, the observation of NO flux with traditional dynamic chamber method is laborious in the forest ecosystem, particularly when the electric power generation system is unavailable. In this work, a relative method based on Pick's law of diffusion was developed to measure NO fluxes from forest soils. This method describes the relationship between NO and other trace gases, such as N2O or CO2, concerning gas fluxes and gas concentration gradients between the uppermost soil layer and the atmosphere. This relative method can be expressed as two forms: based on the directly obtained soil gas and based on the equilibrium gas at soil water surface. To testify the applicability of this method, both laboratory and field experiments were conducted with soil from an N saturated subtropical forest in Southwestern China. The results demonstrate that the NO fluxes measured based on the later form agreed well with those observed by chamber method, with the deviation rates of around 9% and 30%, respectively. In conclusion, this relative method provides a sound methodological basis for interpreting NO flux variations in the field, especially in N -saturated forest ecosystems, and allows an improvement of statistical N-budget in the world.

A STUDY TO EXPLAIN THE EMISSION OF NITRIC-OXIDE FROM A MARSH SOIL. In the period 18-21 September 1989, soil NO emission was studied at Halvergate Marshes, Norfolk (U.K.) within the framework of the BIATEX-LOVENOX joint field experiment. Using a dynamic chamber technique, 186 measurements at four plots were performed showing a net NO flux of 7.2-14.6 x 10(-12) kgN m(-2) s(-1). Soil samples from a soil profile (1.0 m) at a representative site and from the uppermost layer (0.1 m) of each of the four plots were sent to the laboratory for (a) detailed physical and chemical soil analysis, (b) determination of NO production rates, NO uptake rate constants, and NO compensation mixing ratios, and (c) characterization of the microbial processes involved. A diffusive model (Galbally and Johansson, 1989) was applied to the laboratory results to infer NO fluxes of the individual soil samples. When we compared these fluxes with those measured in the field, we found agreement within a factor 2-4. Furthermore, laboratory studies showed, that NO was produced and consumed only in the upper soil layer (0-0.1 m depth) and that the NO production and consumption activities observed in the Halvergate marsh soil were most probably due to the anaerobic metabolism of denitrifying bacteria operating in anaerobic microniches within the generally aerobic soil.

The development of process-based models describing N oxide trace gas emissions from agricultural soils will assist in the assessment of present sources, prediction of future trends, and development of mitigation strategies. We compare the predictions of a transport and transformation model with data from intact soil core experiments and then use the model to evaluate the relative importance of individual processes after application of anhydrous ammonia to moderately acidic soil. Soil-gas concentrations of NO and N2O are adequately described using previously obtained kinetic expressions. Net NO surface fluxes are shown to be the result of high rates of subsurface gross NO production (>100 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) balanced by gross consumption rates equivalent to 92-97% of gross production. The overall temperature dependency of NO emissions is described adequately as the net result of individual temperature-dependent processes. Denitrification was estimated to contribute only 8-14% of the total N2O source under primarily aerobic conditions, with the balance caused by abiotic nitrous acid decomposition. The bulk soil reactivity of NO2 was estimated to be at least 500 times greater than the reactivity of NO. The potential for nonbiological nitrate formation is examined, and the effectiveness of pH control and subsurface fertilizer injection for minimizing gas losses are evaluated.

N2O and NO emissions from poultry litter and urea applications to Bermuda grass. The objectives of the study were to quantify N2O and NO emissions from poultry litter and urea applications to Bermuda grass (Cynodaon dactylon L.) and examine the seasonal variations in emissions. Soil N2O and NO emissions were measured in a Bermuda grass pasture treated with two sources of poultry litter, composted poultry litter (CPL) and fresh poultry litter (FPL) and urea (URE). Nitrogen (N) was applied to supply 336 kg available N ha(-1) in four split applications made during the period from April to August 1995. An automated closed chamber system was employed to monitor N2O and NO emissions. The seasonal N2O emission patterns were characterized by several peaks occurring in phase with intermittent rain events and increasing soil N and organic carbon (C) associated with fertilizer application. The cumulative N2O emissions over the season (May to mid September) from the various treatments were, 3.87 kg N ha(-1) from FPL, 2.96 kg N ha(-1) from URE, and 1.64 kg N ha(-1) from CPL. These seasonal N2O losses accounted for 1.0, 0.73 and 0.32% of the added available N for the, FPL, URE and CPL treatments, respectively. Denitrification was suggested as the primary source of N2O following rain events when inorganic N and C soil concentrations were highest and soil water-filled-pore-space (WFPS) was elevated. Peaks in NO emissions were observed primarily immediately after the addition of N sources. The seasonal NO emissions were smaller and ranged from 1.36 kg N ha(-1) for URE, and 0.97 kg N ha(-1) for FPL, to 0.47 kg N ha(-1) for CPL. The seasonal NO emissions accounted for 0.36, 0.24 and 0.09% of the added N for the URE, FPL, and CPL treatments, respectively. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Synergistic effects of climate change and nitrogen use on future nitric oxide emissions from China's croplands. Accurate quantification of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions can establish a scientific foundation for developing targeted strategies to mitigate emissions, thereby reducing their environmental impact. Using a database with 476 field measurements across China, a NO emission model was constructed by employing four machine learning algorithms including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Our validation with independent observational data revealed that the XGBoost model performed the best, achieving a R2 of 0.67. The most important management, soil, and meteorological variables affecting the NO model were mineral nitrogen input, soil organic carbon content, and air temperature, respectively. This study also found that NO emissions exhibited nonlinear responses to different variables. NO emissions from China's farmland were estimated to be approximately 204.48 kt NO-N in 2020. By 2050, we predicted that NO emissions could increase by 2.9%-9.9% under various climate change scenarios, with the highest increment of 9.9% occurring under the RCP8.5 scenario. The southern agricultural region, which was particularly vulnerable to climate change, experienced the largest increase, ranging from approximately 15%-31%. The implementation of nitrogen management strategies that are adapted to future climate conditions could potentially reduce NO emissions by 15%-16.2%.

Biochar single application and reapplication decreased soil greenhouse gas and nitrogen oxide emissions from rice-wheat rotation: A three-year field observation. Biochar application to soil has been proposed as a promising tool for sequestering carbon, ensuring food security, mitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs), and lowering nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Efforts and observations to determine whether biochar can be repeatedly amended to soil to further sequester carbon while meeting those targets from long term and practical perspective are limited. A three-year field experiment was conducted to observe simultaneous methane (CH4), N2O, and NO emissions in a rice-wheat rotation system, where six treatments were established as follows: control plot without biochar (B0), biochar-enriched soil with biochar applied once in 2012 at 20 t ha-1 (B20-) and 40 t ha-1 (B40-), reapplication of half rate biochar in 2015 at 10 t ha-1 (B20+) and 20 t ha-1 (B40+) to the above described biochar-enriched soils, single application of biochar in 2015 to the control soil at 40 t ha-1 (B40). Then a series of incubation experiments explored the mechanism for mitigating trace gases. The results showed that compared with nonamended soils, the soils with the single biochar application and the biochar reapplication had similar effects on CH4, N2O, and NO emissions, significantly decreasing them by 14.5%-27.1%, 31.5%-43.4%, and 22.4%-33.6%, respectively, when compared with non-amended soils. The decrease in CH4 emissions was largely due to the decrease in CH4 production and the increase in CH4 oxidation in the biochar application treatments. Biochar single and reapplication significantly decreased yield-scaled GHGs by an average of 31.5% and yield-scaled N-oxides by an average of 41.0%. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of biochar in decreasing yield-scaled GHGs and yield-scaled N-oxides did not increase with the biochar reapplication at the two different application rates. Both single and reapplied biochar appeared to be promising practices to mitigate GHG and N-oxide emissions from the rice-wheat rotation system. Biochar can be repeatedly applied for further carbon sequestration while not hindering improvements in crop yield or mitigation of other GHGs and N-oxides.

This review emphasizes recent developments in the literature relating to NO/NOx production in agricultural soils. We have tried to minimize overlap with other recent and relevant review articles. Emission measurements that have been made since 1992 are tabulated and discussed in terms of variability, fertilization effects, and advances made in monitoring fluxes. We describe attempts made by a number of authors to utilize ecological markers such as aeration, water, ammonium, nitrate content, etc. in order to distinguish between nitrification and denitrification as the primary source of production and/or consumption in natural field situations. This may allow a rational accounting for the high spatial and temporal variability observed, and the formulation of reliable predictive models. Factors such as diffusion, oxygen, water, and carbon (content and quality) that regulate or significantly influence production, consumption and emission are discussed. Finally some important implications of recent research relating to nitrification and denitrification is presented showing the chemical oxidation of NO which could occur when the acetylene inhibition technique is used.

Nonlinear response of nitric oxide emissions to a nitrogen application gradient: A case study during the wheat season in a Chinese rice-wheat rotation system. The response of nitric oxide (NO) emissions to nitrogen (N) input in agricultural ecosystems is generally assumed to be linear, but the availability of inorganic soil N exceeding crop N demands may cause a threshold response of NO. We conducted a four-rotation field measurement with discrepant N fertilizer rates during the wheat season of the rice-wheat rotation in the Taihu Lake region in China to test the hypothesis. Across all years, a nonlinear model well characterized the response of cumulative NO emissions to N fertilizer rates. The direct emission factors of NO induced by fertilizer also increased nonlinearly with increasing N doses, with a mean of 1.06% (ranging from 0.54% to 1.49%). NO emissions were low (<1.81 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) over the 0-180 kg N ha(-1) fertilizer additions; above these additions, the increasing N rates resulted in substantial NO increases ranging from 73% to 245% but only elevated crop yields by 6%. The results suggested defining the N rate of 180 kg N ha(-1) as a promising level for achieving decreased NO emissions without greatly affecting the economic return from grain yield.

Independent soil microcosm experiments were used to investigate the effects of the fungicides mancozeb and chlorothalonil, and the herbicide prosulfuron, on N2O and NO production by nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in fertilized soil. Soil cores were amended with NH4NO3 or NH4NO3 and pesticide, and the N2O and NO concentrations were monitored periodically for approximately 48 It following amendment. Nitrification is the major source of N2O and NO in these soils at soil moistures relevant to those observed at the field site where the cores were collected. At pesticide concentrations from 0.02 to 10 times that of a standard single application on a corn crop, N2O and NO production was inhibited by all three pesticides. Generally N2O production was inhibited by the pesticides from 10 to 62% and 20 to 98% at the lowest and highest dosages, respectively. Nitric oxide production was generally inhibited from about 5 to 47% and by 20 to 97% at the lowest and highest dosages, respectively. Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide production by nitrification was more susceptible to inhibition by these pesticides than denitrification. Production of both N2O and NO by nitrification was inhibited by as much as 99%, at the highest concentration of pesticide applied. The net production of N2O increased as soil moisture increased. The rate of NO production was greatest at the intermediate moistures investigated, between 14 and 19% gravimetric soil moisture, suggestive that nitrification is the dominant source of NO.

Emissions of atmospherically important nitrous acid (HONO) gas from northern grassland soil increases in the presence of nitrite (NO2-). Several studies have shown that the use of nitrogen fertilizers increases the emission of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from agricultural soils. Nitrous acid (HONO) is another form of gaseous N which increase the reactivity potential in the atmosphere by forming OH radicals in photolysis and further oxidize pollutants e.g. methane. It has recently been discovered that soil is a source of HONO. In our experiment with grassland (Phleum pratense L.), we found that HONO emissions increased up to 14 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) in the plot receiving annually 450 kg N ha(-1) and were strongly linked with soil nitrite (NO2-) concentration and pH. A strong correlation between HONO and NO emissions was also observed. This finding suggests that agricultural soils could be an important source of HONO and its emission is primarily dependent soil NO2- concentration. Moreover, in agricultural soils the production pathway of HONO and NO could be similar and more studies on the effect of fertilization on HONO emission are needed.

Effects of soil moisture, physical, and chemical characteristics on abiotic nitric oxide production. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of soil water content, and other physical and chemical factors, on the abiotic component of nitric oxide (NO) production in laboratory studies using soils from agricultural fields in Minnesota, California, and Connecticut. In all soils, gross NO production decreased with increasing gravimetric water content (theta) in nitrite (NO2-)-amended sterilized soils. The rate coefficient describing nitrous acid (HNO2)-mediated NO production (k(p)) also decreased with increasing theta in both gamma-irradiated and autoclaved soils. Significant correlations were found between ln k(p) and several soil properties including: content of silt, clay, total carbon, total N, and extractable iron, and an estimate of the cation exchange capacity of the clay fraction. Multiple regression models incorporating these variables explained 85-93% of the variance in ln k(p). The relationships obtained suggest that the mechanism of abiotic NO production is primarily mediated at the soil solution-surface interface. These findings provide consistent evidence of a previously unrecognized mechanism by which soil water content can affect NO production by mediating a chemical process. Application of a dynamic process model indicated that the simulated variation in NO emissions as a consequence of this effect is comparable to the variation observed in previous studies of NO emissions. Comparison of soils from two different long-term tillage studies also indicated that reduced pH in no-till systems may lead to greater NO emissions for a given level of NO2- accumulation. Overall, these results suggest that current views of controls over N oxide gas emissions may need to be revised to include abiotic reactions, in addition to microbial and physical processes, as yet another category of factors that is highly sensitive to soil water content.

Nitrogen oxide gas emissions from temperate forest soils receiving long-term nitrogen inputs. From spring 2000 through fall 2001, we measured nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in two temperate forest sites in Massachusetts, USA that have been treated since 1988 with different levels of nitrogen (N) to simulate elevated rates of atmospheric N deposition. Plots within a pine stand that were treated with either 50 or 150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) above background displayed consistently elevated NO fluxes (100-200 mug N m(-2) h(-1)) compared to control plots, while only the higher N treatment plot within a mixed hardwood stand displayed similarly elevated NO fluxes. Annual NO emissions estimated from monthly sampling accounted for 3.0-3.7% of N inputs to the high-N plots and 8.3% of inputs to the Pine low-N plot. Nitrous oxide fluxes in the N-treated plots were generally < 10% of NO fluxes. Net nitrification rates (NRs) and NO production rates measured in the laboratory displayed patterns that were consistent with field NO fluxes. Total N oxide gas flux was positively correlated with contemporaneous measurements of NR and NO3- concentration. Acetylene inhibited both nitrification and NO production, indicating that autotrophic nitrification was responsible for the elevated NO production. Soil pH was negatively correlated with N deposition rate. Low levels (3-11 mug N kg(-1)) of nitrite (NO2-) were detected in mineral soils from both sites. Kinetic models describing NO production as a function of the protonated form of NO2- (nitrous acid [HNO2]) adequately described the mineral soil data. The results indicate that atmospheric deposition may generate losses of gaseous NO from forest soils by promoting nitrification, and that the response may vary significantly between forest types under similar climatic regimes. The lowering of pH resulting from nitrification and/or directly from deposition may also play a role by promoting reactions involving HNO2 . C1 Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA.

Residual effect of organic carbon as a tool for mitigating nitrogen oxides emissions in semi-arid climate. Residual effects of different fertilizers (mineral and organic) on the first pulses of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O) after rewetting dry soil with or without application of a mineral N fertilizer were studied in a laboratory experiment. Six months before this study was conducted the fields had received either manure + urea, manure, urea or no fertilizer. In the first phase the soil was rewetted with water simulating a summer shower (heavy rainfall in short time) and in the second phase with a urea solution simulating a mineral fertilization. There were not significant differences in trace gas emissions between earlier field treatments after soil was rewetted with water addition. However, after urea addition, plots that had received manure 6 months earlier showed smaller total emissions of N2O and NO compared to plots that had only received urea. The residual effect of manure can play an important role in carbon poor soils under arid-semiarid climate in mitigating atmospheric pollutants such us NO and N2O.

Driving force of tidal pulses on denitrifiers-dominated nitrogen oxide emissions from intertidal wetland sediments. Intertidal wetland sediments are an important source of atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx), but their contribution to the global NOx budget remains unclear. In this work, we conducted year-round and diurnal observations in the intertidal wetland of Jiaozhou Bay to explore their regional source-sink patterns and influence factors on NOx emissions (initially in the form of nitric oxide) and used a dynamic soil reactor to further extend the mechanisms underlying the tidal pulse of nitric oxide (NO) observed in our investigations. The annual fluxes of NOx in the vegetated wetland were significantly higher than those in the wetland without vegetation. Their annual variations could be attributed to changes in temperature and the amount of organic carbon in the sediment, which was derived from vegetated plants and promoted the carbon-nitrogen cycle. Anaerobic denitrifiers had advantages in the intertidal wetland sediment and accounted for the major NO production (63.8 %) but were still limited by nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the sediment. Moreover, the tidal pulse was likely a primary driver of NOx emissions from intertidal wetlands over short periods, which was not considered in previous investigations. The annual NO exchange flux considering the tide pulse contribution (8.93 +/- 1.72 x 10-2 kg N ha-1 yr-1) was significantly higher than that of the non-pulse period (4.14 +/- 1.13 x 10-2 kg N ha-1 yr-1) in our modeling result for the fluxes over the last decade. Therefore, the current measurement of NOx fluxes underestimated the actual gas emission without considering the tidal pulse.

Acidity and organic matter promote abiotic nitric oxide production in drying soils. Soils are an important source of NO, particularly in dry lands because of trade-offs that develop between biotic and abiotic NO-producing processes when soils dry out. Understanding how drier climates may offset the balance of these trade-offs as soils transition toward more arid states is, therefore, critical to estimating global NO budgets, especially because drylands are expected to increase in size. We measured NO emission pulses after wetting soils from similar lithologies along an altitudinal gradient in the Sierra Nevada, CA, where mean annual precipitation varied from 670 to 1500 mm. Along the gradient, we measured field NO emissions, and used chloroform in the laboratory to reduce microbial activity and partition between biotic and abiotic NO-producing processes (i.e., chemodenitrification). Field NO emission pulses were lowest in the acidic and SOM-rich soils (4-72 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1)), but were highest in the high-elevation barren site (similar to 560 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1)). In the laboratory, NO emission pulses were up to 199 greater in chloroform-treated soils than in the controls, and these abiotic pulses increased with elevation as pH decreased (6.2-4.4) and soil organic matter (SOM) increased (18-157 mg C g(-1)). Drought can shift the balance between the biotic and abiotic processes that produce NO, favoring chemodenitrification during periods when biological processes become stressed. Acidic and SOM-rich soils, which typically develop under mesic conditions, are most vulnerable to N loss via NO as interactions between pH, SOM, and drought stimulate chemodenitrification.

Substrate, climate, and land use controls over soil N dynamics and N-oxide emissions in Borneo. Nitrogen (N) enrichment of tropical ecosystems is likely to increase with rapid industrial and agricultural development, but the ecological consequences of N additions in these systems are not well understood. We measured soil N-oxide emissions and N transformations in primary rain forest ecosystems at four elevations and across two substrate types on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo, before and after short-term experimental N additions. We also measured N pools and fluxes across a land use gradient of primary forest, burned secondary forest, and fertilized agriculture. Background soil N2O and NO emissions in primary forest decreased with elevation, and soils derived from sedimentary substrates had larger pools of inorganic N, rates of nitrification, and N-oxide fluxes than ultrabasic soils when there were significant differences between substrate types. N-oxide emissions after N additions and background rates of nitrification were low in all soils derived from ultrabasic substrates compared to sedimentary substrates, even at lowland sites supporting, diverse Dipterocarp forests growing on morphologically similar Oxisols. Rates of potential nitrification were good predictors of N-oxide emissions after N additions. N2O and NO fluxes were largest at low elevations and on sedimentary-derived soils compared to ultrabasic-derived soils, even at the smallest addition of N, 15 kgN ha(-1). Because current methods of soil classification do not explicitly characterize a number of soil chemical properties important to nutrient cycling, the use of soil maps to extrapolate biogeochemical processes to the region or globe may be limited in its accuracy and usefulness. In agricultural systems, management practices were more important than substratetype in controlling N-oxidee missions and soil N cycling. N-oxide fluxes from agricultural fields were more than an order of magnitude greater than from primary forests on the same substrate type and at the same elevation. As primary forests are cleared for intensive agriculture, soil N2O and NO emissions are likely to far exceed those from the most N-saturated tropical forest ecosystems. This study highlights the inter-dependence of climate, substrate age, N deposition, and land-use practices determining N cycling and N-oxide emissions in humid tropical regions.

Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from an irrigated cotton field in Northern China. Cotton is one of the major crops worldwide and delivers fibers to textile industries across the globe. Its cultivation requires high nitrogen (N) input and additionally irrigation, and the combination of both has the potential to trigger high emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), thereby contributing to rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using an automated static chamber measuring system, we monitored in high temporal resolution N2O and NO fluxes in an irrigated cotton field in Northern China, between January 1st and December 31st 2008. Mean daily fluxes varied between 5.8 to 373.0 A mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and -3.7 to 135.7 A mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1), corresponding to an annual emission of 2.6 and 0.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively. The highest emissions of both gases were observed directly after the N fertilization and lasted approximately 1 month. During this time period, the emission was 0.85 and 0.22 kg N ha(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively, and was responsible for 32.3% and 29.0% of the annual total N2O and NO loss. Soil temperature, moisture and mineral N content significantly affected the emissions of both gases (p < 0.01). Direct emission factors were estimated to be 0.95% (N2O) and 0.24% (NO). We also analyzed the effects of sampling time and frequency on the estimations of annual cumulative N2O and NO emissions and found that low frequency measurements produced annual estimates which differed widely from those that were based on continuous measurements.

Soil nitric oxide emissions from nitrification and denitrification. A Silty loam soil treated with 1-allyl-2-thiourea;Is an inhibitor of autotrophic nitrification, and sulfide as an inhibitor of nitric oxide reductase in respiratory denitrification, was studied to evaluate the respective contribution of these two microbial processes to the nitric oxide (NO) flux from the soil. Soil samples were either unamended or amended with ammoniated fertilizer or biosolids from a wastewater treatment plant at an application rate of 100 lb-nitrogen/acre. Water-filled pore space and temperature were maintained within respective ranges of 22 +/- 2% and 22 +/- 1 degreesC. NO fluxes from unamended, chemically fertilized, and biosolids-amended soil samples increase in that order, and autotrophic nitrification accounts for 80, 84, and 92% of the NO flux, respectively. The suggested Jousset-Peirce index Psi, which shows the contribution of respiratory denitrification with respect to heterotrophic nitrification and chemodenitrification, decreases by a factor of 3.3 and 5.6 from unamended to chemically fertilized soil samples and from unamended to biosolids-amended soil samples, respectively.

Modeling nitric oxide emissions from biosolid amended soils. Utilizing a state-of-the-art mobile laboratory in conjunction with a dynamic flow-through chamber system, nitric oxide concentrations [NO] were measured and NO fluxes were calculated during the summer, winter and spring of 1999/ 2000. The field site where these measurements were conducted was an agricultural soil amended with biosolids from a municipal wastewater treatment facility. These NO flux values were then used to assess the impact of including biosolid amended soils as a land-use class in an air quality model. The average NO flux from this biosolid amended soil was found to be exponentially dependent on soil temperature [NO Flux (ng N m(-2) s(-1)) = 1.07 exp(0.14 T-soil); R-2 = 0.81-NO Flux = 71.3 ng N m(-2) s(-1) at 30degreesC]. Comparing this relationship to results of the widely applied biogenic emissions inventory system (BEIS2) model revealed that for this field site, if the BEIS2 model was used, the NO emissions would have been underestimated by a factor of 26. Using this newly developed NO flux algorithm, combined with North Carolina Division of Water Quality statistics on how many biosolid amended acres are permitted per county, county-based NO inventories from these biosolid amended soils were calculated. Results from this study indicate that county-level biogenic NO emissions can increase by as much as 18% when biosolid amended soils are included as a land-use class. The multiscale air quality simulation platform (MAQSIP) was then used to determine differences in ozone (O-3) and odd-reactive nitrogen compounds (NO,) between models run with and without the biosolid amended acreages included in the inventory. Results showed that during the daytime, when atmospheric mixing heights are typically at their greatest, any increase in O-3 or NOy concentrations predicted by the model were small (< 3%). In some locations during late evening/early morning hours, ozone was found to be consumed by as much as 11%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nitrogen oxides emission from soils bearing a potato crop as influenced by fertilization with treated pig slurries and composts. Nitrous oxide, nitric oxide and denitrification losses from an irrigated soil amended with organic fertilizers with different soluble organic carbon fractions and ammonium contents were studied in a field study covering the growing season of potato (Solanum tuberosum). Untreated pig slurry (IPS) with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD), digested thin fraction of pig slurry (DTP), composted solid fraction of pig slurry (CP) and composted municipal solid waste (MSW) mixed with urea were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N ha(-1), and emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment without any added N fertilizer (Control). The cumulative denitrification losses correlated significantly with the soluble carbohydrates, dissolved N and total C added. Added dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved N affected the N2O/N-2 ratio, and a lower ratio was observed for organic fertilizers than from urea or unfertilized controls. The proportion of N2O produced from nitrification was higher from urea than from organic fertilizers. Accumulated N2O losses during the crop season ranged from 3.69 to 7.31 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for control and urea, respectively, whereas NO losses ranged from 0.005 to 0.24 kg NO-N ha(-1), respectively. Digested thin fraction of pig slurry compared to IPS mitigated the total N2O emission by 48% and the denitrification rate by 33%, but did not influence NO emissions. Composted pig slurry compared to untreated pig slurry increased the N2O emission by 40% and NO emission by 55%, but reduced the denitrification losses (34%). DCD partially inhibited nitrification rates and reduced N2O and NO emissions from pig slurry by at least 83% and 77%, respectively. MSW+U, with a C:N ratio higher than that of the composted pig slurry, produced the largest denitrification losses (33.3 kg N ha(-1)), although N2O and NO emissions were lower than for the U and CP treatments. This work has shown that for an irrigated clay loam soil additions of treated organic fertilizers can mitigate the emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and N2O in comparison with urea.

Nitrogen oxide fluxes and nitrogen cycling during postagricultural succession and forest fertilization in the humid tropics. The effects of changes in tropical land use on soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and nitric oxide (NO) are not well understood. We examined emissions of N(2)O and NO and their relationships to land use and forest composition, litterfall, soil nitrogen (N) pools and turnover, soil moisture, and patterns of carbon (C) cycling in a lower montane, subtropical wet region of Puerto Rico. Fluxes of N(2)O and NO were measured monthly for over 1 year in old (more than 60 years old) pastures, early- and mid-successional forests previously in pasture, and late-successional forests not known to have been in pasture within the tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa) forest zone. Additional, though less frequent, measures were also made in an experimentally fertilized tabonuco forest. N(2)O fluxes exceeded NO fluxes at all sites, reflecting the consistently wet environment. The fertilized forest had the highest N oxide emissions (22.0 kg . N . ha(-1) . y(-1)). Among the unfertilized sites, the expected pattern of increasing emissions with stand age did not occur in all cases. The mid-successional forest most dominated by leguminous trees had the highest emissions (9.0 kg N . ha(-1) . y(-1)), whereas the mid-successional forest lacking legumes had the lowest emissions (0.09 kg N . ha(-1) . y(-1)). N oxide fluxes from late-successional forests were higher than fluxes from pastures. Annual N oxide fluxes correlated positively to leaf litter N, net nitrification potential nitrification, soil nitrate, and net N mineralization and negatively to leaf litter C:N ratio. Soil ammonium was not related to N oxide emissions. Forests with lower fluxes of N oxides had higher rates of C mineralization than sites with higher N oxide emissions. We conclude that (a) N oxide fluxes were substantial where the availability of inorganic N exceeded the requirements of competing biota; (b) species composition resulting from historical land use or varying successional dynamics played an important role in determining N availability; and (c) the established ecosystem models that predict N oxide loss from positive relationships with soil ammonium may need to be modified.

The effects of microalgae-based fertilization of wheat on yield, soil microbiome and nitrogen oxides emissions. Overuse of agrochemicals is linked to nutrient loss, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, and resource depletion thus requiring the development of sustainable agricultural solutions. Cultivated microalgal biomass could provide such a solution. The environmental consequences of algal biomass application in agriculture and more specifically its effect on soil GHG emissions are understudied. Here we report the results of a field experiment of wheat grown on three different soil types under the same climatic conditions and fertilized by urea or the untreated biomass of fresh-water green microalga (Coelastrella sp.). The results show that neither soil type nor fertilization types impacted the aboveground wheat biomass, whereas, soil microbiomes differed in accordance with soil but not the fertilizer type. However, wheat grain nitrogen (N) content and soil N oxides emissions were significantly lower in plots fertilized by algal biomass compared to urea. Grain N content in the wheat grain that was fertilized by algal biomass was between 1.3%-1.5% vs. 1.6%-2.0% in the urea fertilized wheat. Cumulative soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions were 2-5 fold lower, 313-726 g N ha-1 season-1 vs. 909-3079 g N ha-1 season-1. Cumulative soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 2-fold lower, 90-348 g N ha-1 season-1 vs. 147-761 g N ha-1 season-1. The lower emissions resulted in a 4-11 fold lower global warming impact of the algal fertilized crops. This calculation excluded the CO2 cost from the algae biomass production. Once included algal fertilization had a similar, or 40% higher, climatic impact compared to the urea fertilization. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reduced iron induced nitric oxide and nitrous oxide emission. Formation of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide in water treatment systems is predominantly studied as a biological phenomenon. There are indications that also chemical processes contribute to these emissions. Here we studied the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) due to chemical nitrite reduction by ferrous iron (Fe(II)). Reduction of nitrite and NO coupled to Fe(II) oxidation was studied in laboratory-scale chemical experiments at different pH, nitrite and iron concentrations. The continuous measurement of both NO and N(2)O emission showed that nitrite reduction and NO reduction have different kinetics. Nitrite reduction shows a linear dependency on the nitrite concentration, implying first order kinetics in nitrite. The nitrite reduction seems to be an equilibrium based reaction, leading to a constant NO concentration in the liquid. The NO reduction rate is suggested to be most dependent on reactive surface availability and the sorption of Fe(II) to the reactive surface. The importance of emission of NO and N(2)O coupled to iron oxidation is exemplified by iron reduction experiments and several examples of environments where this pathway can play a role.

Effects of an experimental drought and recovery on soil emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and nitric oxide in a moist tropical forest. Changes in precipitation in the Amazon Basin resulting from regional deforestation, global warming, and El Nino events may affect emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) from soils. Changes in soil emissions of radiatively important gases could have feedback implications for regional and global climate. Here, we report the final results of a 5-year, large-scale (1 ha) throughfall exclusion experiment, followed by 1 year of recovery with natural throughfall, conducted in a mature evergreen forest near Santarem, Brazil. The exclusion manipulation lowered annual N2O emissions in four out of five treatment years (a natural drought year being the exception), and then recovered during the first year after the drought treatment stopped. Similarly, consumption of atmospheric CH4 increased under drought treatment, except during a natural drought year, and it also recovered to pretreatment values during the first year that natural throughfall was permitted back on the plot. No treatment effect was detected for NO emissions during the first 3 treatment years, but NO emissions increased in the fourth year under the extremely dry conditions of the exclusion plot during a natural drought. Surprisingly, there was no treatment effect on soil CO2 efflux in any year. The drought treatment provoked significant tree mortality and reduced the allocation of C to stems, but allocation of C to foliage and roots were less affected. Taken together, these results suggest that the dominant effect of throughfall exclusion on soil processes during this 6-year period was on soil aeration conditions that transiently affected CH4, N2O, and NO production and consumption.

More than half of all chemical N fertilizer produced globally is used in crop production in East, Southeast and South Asia, where rice is central to nutrition. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) from croplands in this region were estimated by considering background emission and emissions resulting from N added to croplands, including chemical N, animal manure, biologically fixed N and N in crop residues returned to fields. Background emission fluxes of N2O and NO from croplands were estimated to be 1.22 and 0.57 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), respectively. Separate fertilizer-induced emission factors were estimated for upland fields and rice fields. Total N2O emission from croplands in the study region was estimated to be 1.19 Tg N yr(-1), with 43% contributed by background emissions. The average fertilizer-induced N2O emission, however, accounts for only 0.93% of the applied N, which is less than the default IPCC value of 1.25%, because of the low emission factor from paddy fields. Total NO emission was 591 Gg N yr(-1) in the study region, with 40% from background emissions. The average fertilizer-induced NO emission factor was 0.48%. Total NH3 emission was estimated to be 11.8 Tg N yr(-1). The use of urea and ammonium bicarbonate and the cultivation of rice led to a high average NH3 loss rate from chemical N fertilizer in the study region. Emissions were displayed at a 0.5degrees x 0.5degrees resolution with the use of a global landuse database. C1 Frontier Res Syst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.

Soil biogenic emissions of nitric oxide from a semi-arid savanna in South Africa. Soils of arid and semi-arid ecosystems are important biogenic sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), however, there is still a shortage of measurements from these systems. Here we present the results of a laboratory study of the biogenic emission of NO from four different landscape positions of the Kruger National Park (KNP), a large conservation area in a semi-arid region of South Africa. Results show that the highest net potential NO fluxes come from the low lying (footslope) landscape regions, which have the largest nitrogen stocks and highest rates of nitrogen input into the soil. Net potential NO fluxes from midslope and crest regions were considerably lower. The maximum release of NO occurred at fairly low soil moisture contents of 10%-20% water filled pore space. Using soil moisture and temperature data obtained in situ at the Kruger National Park flux tower site, net potential NO fluxes obtained in the laboratory were converted to field fluxes for each of the four landscape positions for the period 2003 to 2005. The highest field NO flux is from footslope positions, during each of these years and emissions ranged from 1.5-8.5 kg ha a (in terms of mass of nitrogen). Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems techniques were used to up-scale field NO fluxes on a regional basis indicating that the highest emissions occurred from the midslope positions, due to their large geographical extent in the considered research area. Emissions for the KNP Skukuza land type (56 000 ha) ranged from 20 x 10(3) kg in 2004 to 34 x 10(3) kg in 2003. The importance of landscape characteristics in the determination of regional biogenic NO soil emission is emphasized. C1 [Feig, G. T.; Mamtimin, B.; Meixner, F.

A review of soil NO transformation: Associated processes and possible physiological significance on organisms. NO emissions from soils and ecosystems are of outstanding importance for atmospheric chemistry. Here we review the current knowledge on processes involved in the formation and consumption of NO in soils, the importance of NO for the physiological functioning of different organisms, and for inter- and intra-species signaling and competition, e.g. in the rooting zone between microbes and plants. We also show that prokaryotes and eukaryotes are able to produce NO by multiple pathways and that unspecific enzymo-oxidative mechanisms of NO production are likely to occur in soils. Nitric oxide production in soils is not only linked to NO production by nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms, but also linked to extracellular enzymes from a wide range of microorganisms. Further investigations are needed to clarify molecular mechanisms of NO production and consumption, its controlling factors, and the significance of NO as a regulator for microbial, animal and plant processes. Such process understanding is required to elucidate the importance of soils as sources (and sinks) for atmospheric NO. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reduced fertilization mitigates N2O emission and drip irrigation has no impact on N2O and NO emissions in plastic-shed vegetable production in northern China. Plastic-shed vegetable production in China creates hotspots for emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and the atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO). To mitigate N2O and NO emissions, determination of the predominant processes of N2O and NO generation in plastic-shed vegetable production is important. Here, we reported the findings of a 2-year experimental study on the effects of reduced fertilization and/or drip irrigation on N2O and NO emissions during plastic-shed tomato production in northern China. Five treatments were applied: 1) over fertilization and flood irrigation (conventional practice); 2) fertilization reduced by 20% and flood irrigation; 3) fertilization reduced by 20% and drip irrigation; 4) fertilization reduced by 30% and drip irrigation, and 5) control (no fertilizer input and flood irrigation). Reduced both basal and top-dressed fertilization maintained tomato yields. Compared with conventional practices (mean annual N2O and NO emissions: 18.1 +/- 1.3 and 0.79 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively), fertilization reduction by 20%-30% decreased the annual N2O emission by 21.2%-27.0% owing to lower soil inorganic nitrogen (SIN) contents under the reduced fertilization practices. Switching from flood to drip irrigation might weaken denitrification due to lower soil moisture and less wet soil area, but increased SINcontents, and thus had no significant impact on annual N2O and NO emissions. Peak N2O fluxes occurred at soil temperature 28 degrees C and waterfilled pore space (WFPS) > 60%, were higher than those for NO, and peak NO fluxes appeared 4-6 days later than N2O fluxes, consistent with the decline in WFPS. These observations indicated that N2O and NO from alkaline plastic-shed soil may bemainly generated via heterotrophic denitrification and nitrification, respectively. Reduced fertilization and drip irrigation in plastic-shed tomato production maintained crop productivity and mitigated N2O emission. These results could be integrated into the decision-making in sustainable plastic-shed production.

Measurement and modeling of nitrous and nitric oxide emissions from a tea field in subtropical central China. Tea fields represent an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions due to high nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications and very low soil pH. To investigate the temporal characteristics of N2O and NO emissions, daily emissions were measured over 2A 1/2 years period using static closed-chamber/gas chromatograph and chemiluminescent measurement system in a tea field of subtropical central China. Our results revealed that N2O and NO fluxes showed similar temporal trends, which were generally driven by temporal variations in soil temperature and soil moisture content and were also affected by fertilization events. The measured average annual N2O and NO emissions were 10.9 and 3.3 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, highlighting the high N2O and NO emissions from tea fields. To improve our understanding of N-cycling processes in tea ecosystems, we developed a new nitrogenous gas emission module for the water and nitrogen management model (WNMM, V2) that simulated daily N2O and NO fluxes, in which the NO was simulated as being emitted from both nitrification and nitrite chemical decomposition. The results demonstrated that the WNMM captured the general temporal dynamics of N2O (NSE = 0.40; R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 0.03 kg N ha(-1) day(-1), P < 0.001) and NO (NSE = 0.41; R-2 = 0.44, RMSE = 0.01 kg N ha(-1) day(-1), P < 0.001) emissions. According to the simulation, denitrification was identified as the dominant process contributing 76.5% of the total N2O emissions, while nitrification and nitrite chemical decomposition accounted for 52.3 and 47.7% of the total NO emissions, respectively.

Historical and future land use effects on N2O and NO emissions using an ensemble modeling approach: Costa Rica's Caribbean lowlands as an example - art. no. 1068. The humid tropical zone is a major source area for N2O and NO emissions to the atmosphere. Local emission rates vary widely with local conditions, particularly land use practices which swiftly change with expanding settlement and changing market conditions. The combination of wide variation in emission rates and rapidly changing land use make regional estimation and future prediction of biogenic trace gas emission particularly difficult. This study estimates contemporary, historical, and future N2O and NO emissions from 0.5 million ha of northeastern Costa Rica, a well-documented region in the wet tropics undergoing rapid agricultural development. Estimates were derived by linking spatially distributed environmental data with an ecosystem simulation model in an ensemble estimation approach that incorporates the variance and covariance of spatially distributed driving variables. Results include measures of variance for regional emissions. The formation and aging of pastures from forest provided most of the past temporal change in N2O and NO flux in this region; future changes will be controlled by the degree of nitrogen fertilizer application and extent of intensively managed croplands.

Emissions of nitrous acid (HONO), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from horse dung. Horse dung contains considerable amounts of nitrogen which is partly lost during the storage period. Leaching of nitrogen from the dung can be prevented with constructions but also gaseous N-emissions occur. However, the emission rates are not reported in the literature. We measured in laboratory conditions nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO) emissions from fresh, one month old and one year old horse dung samples. NO and HONO emissions increased with the storage time of the dung. The mean emission rates of HONO and NO were from 36 to 280 ng N kg dw(-1) h(-1) and from 15 to 3500 ng N kg dw(-1) h(-1), respectively. N2O emissions were more variable showing also highest emissions (20.3 mu g N kg dw(-1) h(-1)) from the oldest samples. Thus, the longer storage of horse dung increases gaseous N losses which should be taken into account when planning an environmental friendly way to handle horse dung.

Nitrogen oxide emissions affected by organic fertilization in a non-irrigated Mediterranean barley field. Contradictory findings can be found in the literature regarding the effects of applying organic instead of mineral fertilizers on the associated emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). The main aim of this experiment was to study the effect on these emissions of applying mineral or organic fertilizers to a non-irrigated crop under Mediterranean conditions. A secondary aim was to determine whether application of the fertilizer had a residual effect on the N2O and NO pulses observed after the first rainfall events in autumn, and the magnitude of these fluxes. A field experiment was carried out with a barley crop (Hordeum vulgare L cv Bornova). Untreated pig slurry (UPS), digested pig slurry (DPS), municipal solid waste (MSW) and composted crop residues mixed with sewage sludge (CCR + S) were applied to the soil. The resulting emissions were compared with those from a mineral fertilizer, urea (U), and a control treatment (C), in which no nitrogen was applied. Very low NO and N2O fluxes were measured during the entire experimental period in all treatments. The accumulated N2O emissions from the organic and inorganic fertilizers ranged from 266 to 345 g N2O-N ha(-1) and did not show significant differences. Three of the four organic fertilizers had the positive effect of reducing NO emissions (28.82-44.48 g NO-N ha(-1)) compared with inorganic fertilizer (61.86 g NO-N ha(-1)). Nitrous oxide pulses were observed in autumn. Negative N2O fluxes were measured on several occasions. The emission factor relating N2O emissions to the N applied as fertilizer, ranged from 0.06 to 0.17% for MSW and DPS, respectively, which is much lower than the default factor proposed by the IPCC. The emission factor which relates N2O emissions to crop production ranged from 241 to 361 mg N2O-N kg(-1) for DPS and U, respectively, suggesting that DPS should be promoted in order to reduce N2O emissions.

Process modeling of controls on nitrogen trace gas emissions from soils worldwide. We report on an ecosystem modeling approach that integrates global satellite, climate, vegetation, and soil data sets to (1) examine conceptual controls on nitrogen trace gas (NO, N2O, and N-2) emissions from soils and (2) identify weaknesses in our bases of knowledge and data for these fluxes. Nitrous and nitric oxide emissions from well-drained soils were estimated by using an expanded version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford (CASA) Biosphere model, a coupled ecosystem production and soil carbon-nitrogen model on a 1 degrees global grid. We estimate monthly production of NO, N2O, and N-2 based on predicted rates of gross N mineralization, together with an index of transient water-filled pore space in soils. Analyses of model performance along selected climate gradients support the hypothesis that low temperature restricts predicted N mineralization and trace gas emission rates in moist northern temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, whereas in tropical zones, seasonal patterns in N mineralization result in emission peaks for N2O that coincide with wetting and high soil moisture content. The model predicts the annual N2O:NO flux ratio at a mean value of 1.2 in wet tropical forests, decreasing to around 0.6 in the seasonally dry savannas. Global emission estimates at the soil surface are 6.1 Tg N and 9.7 Tg N yr(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively, Tropical dry forests and savannas are identified by using this formulation as important source areas for nitrogen trace gas emissions. Because humans continue to alter these ecosystems extensively for agricultural uses, our results suggest that more study is needed in seasonally dry ecosystems of the tropics in order to understand the global impacts of land use change on soil sources for N2O and NO.

Emissions of Greenhouse Gases and NO from Rice Fields and a Peach Orchard as Affected by N Input and Land-Use Conversion. Nitrogen (N) inputs and land-use conversion are management practices that affect soil greenhouse gas (GHG) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Here, we measured soil methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and NO fluxes from rice fields and a peach orchard that converted from paddies to assess the impacts of nitrogen (N) inputs and land-use conversion on their emissions. Treatments included four paddy field treatments (PN0, PN160, PN220, and PN280) and one peach orchard treatment (ON280) with number indicating the N-input rate of kg N ha(-1). The results showed that cumulative emissions of CH4, N2O and NO ranged from 28.6 to 85.3 kg C ha(-1), 0.5 to 4.0 kg N ha(-1) and 0.2 to 0.3 kg N ha(-1) during the rice-growing season, respectively. In terms of greenhouse gas intensity, the PN280 treatment is the recommended N application rate. Land-use conversion significantly reduced the global warming potential from croplands. The conversion shifted soils from an essential source of CH4 to a small net sink. In addition, N2O emissions from the rice-wheat rotation system were 1.8 times higher than from the orchard, mainly due to the difference in the N application rate. In summary, to reduce agriculture-induced GHG emissions, future research needs to focus on the effects of N inputs on rice-upland crop rotation systems.

Comparison of the DNDC, LandscapeDNDC and IAP-N-GAS models for simulating nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system. The DNDC, LandscapeDNDC and IAP-N-GAS models have been designed to simulate the carbon and nitrogen processes of terrestrial ecosystems. Until now, a comparison of these models using simultaneous observations has not been reported, although such a comparison is essential for further model development and application. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the models, delineate the strengths and limitations of each model for simulating soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, and explore short-comings of these models that may require reconsideration. We conducted comparisons among the models using simultaneous observations of both gases and relevant variables from the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system at three field sites with calcareous soils. Simulations of N2O and NO emissions by the three models agreed well with annual observations, but not with daily observations. All models failed to correctly simulate soil moisture, which could explain some of the incorrect daily fluxes of N2O and NO, especially for intensive fluxes during the growing season. Multi-model ensembles are promising approaches to better simulate daily gas emissions. IAP-N-GAS underestimated the priming effect of straw incorporation on N2O and NO emissions, but better results were obtained with DNDC95 and LandscapeDNDC. LandscapeDNDC and IAP-N-GAS need to improve the simulation of irrigation water allocation and residue decomposition processes, respectively, and together to distinguish different irrigation methods as DNDC95 does. All three models overestimated the emissions of the nitrogenous gases for high nitrogen fertilizer (>430 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) addition treatments, and therefore, future research should focus more on the simulation of the limitation of soil dissolvable organic carbon on denitrification in calcareous soils.

EFFECTS OF SOIL-MOISTURE, TEMPERATURE, AND INORGANIC NITROGEN ON NITRIC-OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM ACIDIC TROPICAL SAVANNA SOILS. NO fluxes from soils with a wide range of soil moistures, soil inorganic-N concentrations, and soil temperatures were measured during the wet and the dry season at a Venezuelan savannah site. Maximum No emissions (approximately 12 ngN m-2 s-1) were observed at soil gravimetric moistures between 10% and 18%. Deviation from this optimum range results in decreased NO fluxes; very low emissions (< 2 ngN m-2 s-1) were recorded at low (< 2%) and high (> 25%) soil moistures. Both NO production in soil and its transport within the soil play important roles in the emission of NO to the atmosphere. Under most conditions no temperature effect was observed. NO emission was strongly stimulated by the addition of NO3- and only very weakly by the addition of NH4+; at low and moderate soil moistures, soil nitrate and the NO flux were positively correlated. At low (natural) soil nitrate content and comparable soil moisture and temperature, No emissions were greater during the dry season than during the rainy season, suggesting that other factors (i.e., soil physical structure) may also govern No flux from savannah soil.

Benefits of integrated nutrient management on N2O and NO mitigations in water-saving ground cover rice production systems. To cope with challenges of food security and water scarcity in rice production, water-saving ground cover rice production systems (GCRPSs) are increasingly adopted in China and globally. Reduced soil moisture as well as increased soil aeration and temperature under GCRPSs may promote soil N transformations, and in turn give rise to environmental challenges. These include emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO). Using conventional flooding rice cultivation as a reference, a three-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the performances of GCRPSs under inorganic (urea) or integrated nutrient management (a combination of synthetic and organic fertilizers), with regards to soil N2O and NO emissions as well as grain yields. N2O and NO emissions in GCRPSs exhibited high seasonal and interannual variations along with changes in soil inorganic N content and rainfall. When urea alone was applied, the average N2O and NO emissions from GCRPSs were 4.11 and 0.14 kg N ha(-1), respectively. These emissions were significantly higher than those of conventional rice cultivation, with 1.47 and 0.052 kg N ha(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively. When integrated nutrient management was performed for GCRPSs, N2O and NO emissions were reduced by approximately 77% and 50%, respectively, i.e., the emission magnitude comparable with N-trace gas losses from conventional rice cultivation. Moreover, GCRPSs with integrated nutrient management resulted in optimal grain yields, and thus, the yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions were the lowest compared to other treatments. Averaged over 3 years, the direct emission factors of N2O and NO for GCRPSs with urea alone were 2.58% and 0.064%, respectively. Those for GCRPSs with integrated nutrient management were 0.48% and 0.016%, respectively. The results of this study suggest that GCRPS with integrated nutrient management is an eco-friendly strategy for optimizing crop yields while mitigating N2O and NO emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

NO, N2O and CO2 soil emissions from Venezuelan corn fields under tillage and no-tillage agriculture. The largest share of Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) anthropogenic greenhouse gases is derived from land use changes as well as forestry and agriculture, representing up to 67 % of the relative contribution from all sources. However, in spite of the rapid expansion of LAC tropical agriculture, little is known about its impact on atmospheric trace gases emissions, such as nitrogen oxides (NO (x) ), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which are produced in soils by microbial processes and also accelerated in tropical climates. This information is crucial for assessing mitigation strategies linked to agricultural practices to satisfy food demands for the region's future. We measured NO, N2O and CO2 soil emissions along with soil variables from corn fields under tillage (T) and no-tillage (NT) agriculture at two of the largest cereal-producing regions in Venezuela during the crop-growing season. We found statistically significant positive correlations between the logarithms of nitrogen gas emissions and soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations, soil water and clay contents. Average emissions of NO and CO2 were larger in T than NT sites, while N2O fluxes showed the opposite. CO2 emissions from T were 1.6 as much as those found in NT, whereas N2O was 0.5 of that found in NT. These results imply that NT practices more effectively mitigate climate change from these monoculture systems mainly because of CO2 emission reduction. We suggest then that agricultural mitigation actions for tropical monoculture systems should aim for the enhancement of NT management practices along with N fertilization rate reduction to compensate for the larger N2O emissions.

Laboratory measurements of nitric oxide release from forest soil with a thick organic layer under different understory types. Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the photochemistry of the troposphere. NO from soil contributes up to 40% to the global budget of atmospheric NO. Soil NO emissions are primarily caused by biological activity (nitrification and denitrification), that occurs in the uppermost centimeter of the soil, a soil region often characterized by high contents of organic material. Most studies of NO emission potentials to date have investigated mineral soil layers. In our study we sampled soil organic matter under different understories (moss, grass, spruce and blueberries) in a humid mountainous Norway spruce forest plantation in the Fichtelgebirge (Germany). We performed laboratory incubation and flushing experiments using a customized chamber technique to determine the response of net potential NO flux to physical and chemical soil conditions (water content and temperature, bulk density, particle density, pH, C/N ratio, organic C, soil ammonium, soil nitrate). Net potential NO fluxes (in terms of mass of N) from soil samples taken under different understories ranged from 1.7-9.8 ng m(-2) s(-1) (soil sampled under grass and moss cover), 55.4-59.3 ng m(-2) s(-1) (soil sampled under spruce cover), and 43.7-114.6 ng m(-2) s(-1) (soil sampled under blueberry cover) at optimum water content and a soil temperature of 10 degrees C. The water content for optimum net potential NO flux ranged between 0.76 and 0.8 gravimetric soil moisture for moss covered soils, between 1.0 and 1.1 for grass covered soils, 1.1 and 1.2 for spruce covered soils, and 1.3 and 1.9 for blueberry covered soils. Effects of soil physical and chemical characteristics on net potential NO flux were statistically significant (0.01 probability level) only for NH4+. Therefore, as an alternative explanation for the differences in soil biogenic NO emission we consider more biological factors like understory vegetation type, amount of roots, and degree of mycorrhization; they have the potential to explain the observed differences of net potential NO fluxes.

Large nitrogen oxide emission pulses from desert soils and associated microbiomes. Nitrogen (N) trace gas emission pulses produced after wetting dry soils may be important pathways of ecosystem N loss. However, the rates and mechanisms controlling these emissions remain unclear. We tested whether changes in microbial community structure and increased rates of atmospheric N deposition could explain N emissions at two desert sites differing in atmospheric N deposition by similar to six fold. We measured peak NOx (sum of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) emissions 12 h post-wetting. NOx emissions remained elevated over 24 h and increased after adding N. In contrast, we measured the highest nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions within only 15 min post-wetting. N2O emissions decreased within 12 h, were insensitive to adding N, and were among the highest reported globally. Microbial communities at the high N deposition site were less diverse with higher 16S nitrifier and bacterial amoA gene abundances relative to the low N deposition site, suggesting an increased capacity for nitrification. Nevertheless, N emissions were lower at the high N deposition site. While microbial communities changed after wetting, these changes were not correlated with N emissions. We conclude that desert soils can produce substantial NOx and N2O emission pulses, but that these emissions do not appear directly governed by changing microbial community characteristics or higher atmospheric N inputs. These findings highlight the importance of gaseous N loss pathways from dryland ecosystems that may contribute to sustained N limitation, with implications for atmospheric chemistry and Earth's climate.

Biochar Mitigated Yield-Scaled N2O and NO Emissions and Ensured Vegetable Quality and Soil Fertility: A 3-Year Greenhouse Field Observation. Biochar amendments have been widely used in agricultural soil for lowering N2O and NO emissions while improving soil fertility and crop performance. However, a thorough understanding of the longevity of the favorable effects would be a prerequisite for large-scale biochar application in agriculture. We conducted a three-year greenhouse vegetable trial in Southeast China to systematically investigate the impacts of biochar mixed with nitrogen (N) on soil N2O and NO emissions, vegetable performance, and soil fertility at an interannual scale. The field experiment was established in November 2016 with biochar (0, 20 and 40 t ha(-1); C0, C1, and C2, respectively), applied once without/with 240 kg N ha(-1) urea (N0 or N1, respectively). Soil N2O and NO emissions were monitored during the spring vegetable cultivation period, and vegetable yield, quality, and soil properties were measured after harvests in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Results indicated that N application significantly increased N2O and NO emissions and vegetable yield throughout the trial period. Biochar combined with N generally reduced N2O and NO emissions and emission factors while increasing the vegetable yield, leading to lower yield-scaled N2O and NO emissions in 2018 and 2019. Biochar markedly enhanced soil pH and organic carbon and persisted, but generally had no significant effect on N use efficiency (NUE), vegetable quality, and soil fertility index (SFI) among treatments in over-fertilized vegetable fields. Based on our results, biochar application at 20 t ha(-1) combined with N seemed to achieve the highest agronomic and environmental benefits for intensive vegetable production in Southeast China.

NxO emissions in response to the irrigation lower limits under different irrigation modes in a lettuce field. Irrigation has a significant impact on NxO (N2O and NO) emissions from cultivated land, yet the N2O or NO emission among the irrigation lower limits under different irrigation modes has not been well compared. In an irrigated lettuce field, three DR (drip irrigation) lower limits were designed, including 75% (DR1), 65% (DR2) and 55% (DR3) field capacity, and one FI (furrow irrigation) lower limit (65% field capacity). The N2O and NO emission fluxes and soil nitrogen (N) forms were determined, and the linear correlation between these indicators was analyzed. Results showed that under the same irrigation regime, the N2O and NO emissions from furrow irrigation treatment increased by 36.8% and 45.2% respectively compared to that from drip irrigation treatment. The cumulative N2O and NO emissions under DR3 were 30.2% and 28.6% higher than under DR1, respectively. Moreover, DR1 was also the lowest among the four treatments in soil-N NO- 3 concentration. The N2O and NO emission fluxes were more correlated to soil-N (r=0.88 and 0.76) or-N (r=0.90 and NH+ NO- 4 2 0.80) concentration than soil-N and soluble organic N, indicating that N2O and NO were mainly produced by the soil NO- 3 nitrification process. When the irrigation regime was the same, N2O and NO emissions were lower with drip irrigation than with furrow irrigation. Besides, drip irrigation with small quota but high frequency reduced N2O and NO emission compared to that with large quota but low frequency.

Importance of soil NO emissions for the total atmospheric NOX budget of Saxony, Germany. Soils are a significant source for the secondary greenhouse gas NO and assumed to be a significant source of tropospheric NOx in rural areas. Here we tested the LandscapeDNDC model for its capability to simulate magnitudes and dynamics of soil NO emissions for 22 sites differing in land use (arable, grassland and forest) and edaphic as well as climatic conditions. Overall, LandscapeDNDC simulated mean soil NO emissions agreed well with observations (r(2) = 0.82). However, simulated day to day variations of NO did only agree weakly with high temporal resolution measurements, though agreement between simulations and measurements significantly increased if data were aggregated to weekly, monthly and seasonal time scales. The model reproduced NO emissions from high and low emitting sites, and responded to fertilization (mineral and organic) events with pulse emissions. After evaluation, we linked the LandscapeDNDC model to a GIS database holding spatially explicit data on climate, land use, soil and management to quantify the contribution of soil biogenic NO emissions to the total NOx budget for the State of Saxony, Germany. Our calculations show that soils of both agricultural and forest systems are significant sources and contribute to about 8% (uncertainty range: 6 -13%) to the total annual tropospheric NO, budget for Saxony. However, the contributions of soil NO emission to total tropospheric NO, showed a high spatial variability and in some rural regions such as the Ore Mts., simulated soil NO emissions were by far more important than anthropogenic sources.

Long-term straw return to a wheat-maize system results in topsoil organic C saturation and increased yields while no stimulating or reducing yield-scaled N2O and NO emissions. Straw return to agricultural soils is considered as a key strategy to improve soil organic C (SOC) sequestration and crop production. However, changes in SOC can affect soil N-turnover and associated N2O and NO fluxes, as soil biogeochemical C- and N-cycles are strongly coupled. Understanding how and to what extent N-trace gas emissions per unit crop yield respond to changes in SOC following straw return, is critical for balancing food security and climate change mitigation. Here we report on an experiment in a Chinese wheat-maize system designed to understand the effects of long-term (2005-2020) different straw management options (straw return, burning or removal) on SOC stocks and yields, completed by N2O and NO flux measurements over the period 2016-2020. Our results showed that the increase in SOC stocks following straw return tended to level off over time, indicating that SOC saturation is reached after 12-13 years under straw return. Soil N-trace gas emissions showed high inter- and intra-annual variability, which were largely driven by changes in rainfall, soil hydrothermal conditions or soil C- and N-availability. Compared to straw burning or removal, long-term straw return increased annual N2O emissions by 9 %-49 %, to 2.72-2.98 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), while NO emissions were decreased by 12 %-28 %, to 0.83-0.90 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The annual N2O emissions roughly offset the total C sink (SOC sequestration and CH4 uptake) by 40 %-46 %, but will override the climate benefits of total C sink as the SOC pool becomes saturated. However, because yields were higher in straw return treatments, yield-scaled annual N2O emissions remained unchanged. Our unique dataset allows for the first time a better understanding of the dynamics between SOC sequestration, yields and N-trace gas emissions, with results calling for action to address the risk of increasing N2O emissions following long-term SOC increases induced by straw return.

Relationships between Fungal Biomass and Nitrous Oxide Emission in Upland Rice Soils under No Tillage and Cover Cropping Systems. The relationships between soil microbial properties and nitrous oxide emission were examined in upland Soil under different tillage systems [no tillage (NT), rotary and plow tillage] and cover crop systems (fallow, cereal rye, and hairy vetch) in 2004 and 2005. Microbiological analyses included the determination of soil ergosterol as all indicator of fungal biomass, bacterial plate counting, and MPN estimations of ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers. The combined practice of NT with rye-cover crop treatment increased fungal biomass but not bacterial populations in 0-10 cm deep soils. Such increase in fungal biomass was not found in 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm deep cover-cropped NT soil. The combined practice of NT with rye-cover cropping resulted in higher in situ N2O emission rates compared with rotary- and plow-till treatments. N2O flux was positively correlated with soil ergosterol content but not with denitrifier MPN and other soil chemical properties. These results suggested a significant contribution of fungi to N2O emission in cover-cropped NT soils.

Influence of soil pH on NOx and N2O emissions from bovine urine applied to soil columns. The nitrous oxide (N2O) molecule is both a greenhouse gas and a precursor to the formation of nitric oxide (NO) in the stratosphere, which is subsequently involved in catalytic destruction of ozone (O-3). Tropospheric NO can form NO2 with both gases (NOx) able to react with volatile organic compounds to produce the detrimental O-3 molecule. Information on how NO and N2O emissions respond to agricultural management is lacking. Limited data suggest N2O emissions following bovine urine deposition may vary with soil pH. This work hypothesised that soil liming would also reduce NOx emissions due to enhanced nitrification and reduced opportunity for HNO2 formation as soil pH increased. Bovine urine was applied (575 kg N/ha) to repacked soil cores (34% water-filled pore space) that ranged in pH from 4.4 to 7.6, and these were maintained at 21 degrees C. With the exception of the pH 4.4 treatment, increases in NO-N fluxes occurred during the first 11 days, when nitrification was proceeding. Increasing the initial soil pH enhanced the net ammonium depletion rate. The loss of NO-N, expressed as a percentage of the net ammonium depletion rate, decreased with increasing initial pH during this first 11 days with NO-N fluxes reduced due to competition between abiotic and biological demands for NO2-. After 21 days, the optimal pH for the net NO-N flux was observed to be 5.7 to 6.0. However, cumulative NO-N fluxes after 35 days showed little variation due to initial soil pH and ranged from 0.02 to 0.05% of urine-N applied. The cumulative N2O-N flux ranged from 0.04 to 0.09% of urine-N applied with a linear increase from pH 5.7 to pH 7.6. Based on these results, where soils are relatively dry, liming acid soils from pH 5.5 to pH 6.5 will not affect cumulative NO fluxes from urine patches. However, cumulative N2O fluxes may be enhanced. C1 [Khan, S.; Clough, T. J.; Goh, K. M.; Sherlock, R. R.] Lincoln Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Dept Soil & Phys Sci, Lincoln, New Zealand.

Role of maize stover incorporation on nitrogen oxide emissions in a non-irrigated Mediterranean barley field. Agricultural soils in semiarid Mediterranean areas are characterized by low organic matter contents and low fertility levels. Application of crop residues and/or manures as amendments is a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to overcome this problem. However, these management practices may induce important changes in the nitrogen oxide emissions from these agroecosystems, with additional impacts on carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, a field experiment was carried out with a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) crop under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effect of combining maize (Zea mays L.) residues and N fertilizer inputs (organic and/or mineral) on these emissions. Crop yield and N uptake, soil mineral N concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), denitrification capacity, N2O, NO and CO2 fluxes were measured during the growing season. The incorporation of maize stover increased N2O emissions during the experimental period by c. 105 %. Conversely, NO emissions were significantly reduced in the plots amended with crop residues. The partial substitution of urea by pig slurry reduced net N2O emissions by 46 and 39 %, with and without the incorporation of crop residues respectively. Net emissions of NO were reduced 38 and 17 % for the same treatments. Molar DOC:NO (3) (-) ratio was found to be a robust predictor of N2O and NO fluxes. The main effect of the interaction between crop residue and N fertilizer application occurred in the medium term (4-6 month after application), enhancing N2O emissions and decreasing NO emissions as consequence of residue incorporation. The substitution of urea by pig slurry can be considered a good management strategy since N2O and NO emissions were reduced by the use of the organic residue.

Effects of soil water content, temperature and experimental nitrogen deposition on nitric oxide (NO) efflux from semiarid shrubland soil. Southern Californian urban shrublands are exposed to high nitrogen (N) deposition, which can potentially enhance soil nitric oxide (NO) efflux; however, environmental controls on NO emission are still uncertain. We conducted a laboratory experiment to evaluate the NO efflux response of chaparral soil to variations in N availability, temperature and moisture. We hypothesized that NO efflux would increase with N addition, have an optimum response to soil moisture, and increase exponentially with temperature. Our results supported our hypotheses. Nitrogen addition caused a linear increase in NO efflux, primarily because of an increase in NH4+. NO efflux reached a peak at intermediate soil moisture (25% water-filled pore space (WFPS)), and the temperature response of NO flux was well-described by the Arrhenius model. However, there were statistically significant interactions between N, temperature and soil water content, making the NO response complex. Our results suggest that southern California urban shrublands may be important sources of NO, and that chronic, high levels of anthropogenic N deposition will enhance NO efflux from these ecosystems.

CONTRIBUTIONS OF AUTOTROPHIC AND HETEROTROPHIC NITRIFIERS TO SOIL NO AND N2O EMISSIONS. Soil emission of gaseous N oxides during nitrification of ammonium represents loss of an available plant nutrient and has an important impact on the chemistry of the atmosphere. We used selective inhibitors and a glucose amendment in a factorial design to determine the relative contributions of autotrophic ammonium oxidizers, autotrophic nitrite oxidizers, and heterotrophic nitrifiers to nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from aerobically incubated soil following the addition of 160 mg of N as ammonium sulfate kg-1. Without added C, peak NO emissions of 4 .mu.g N kg-1 h-1 were increased to 15 .mu.g of N kg-1 h-1 by the addition of sodium chlorate, a nitrite oxidation inhibitor, but were reduced to 0.01 .mu.g of N kg-1 h-1 in the presence of nitrapyrin [2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)-pyridine], an inhibitor of autotrophic ammonium oxidation. Carbon-amended soils had somewhat higher NO emission rates from these three treatments (6, 18, and 0.1 .mu.g of N kg-1 h-1 after treatment with glucose, sodium chlorate, or nitrapyrin, respectively) until the glucose was exhausted but lower rates during the remainder of the incubation. Nitrous oxide emission levels exhibited trends similar to those observed for NO but were about 20 times lower. Periodic soil chemical analyses showed no increase in the nitrate concentration soil treated with sodium chlorate until after the period of peak NO and N2O emissions; the nitrate concentration of soil treated with nitrapyrin remained unchanged throughout the incubation. These results suggest that chemoautotrophic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria are the predominant source of NO and N2O produced during nitrification in soil. C1 USDA ARS, POB E, FT COLLINS, CO 80522 USA.

Impact of Long-Term Application of Fertilizers on N2O and NO Production Potential in an Intensively Cultivated Sandy Loam Soil. Literature reports on N2O and NO emissions from organic and mineral agricultural soil amended with N-containing fertilizers have reached contradictory conclusions. To understand the influence of organic manure (OM) and chemical fertilizer application on N2O and NO emissions, we conducted laboratory incubation experiments on an agricultural sandy loam soil exposed to different long-term fertilization practices. The fertilizer treatments were initiated in 1989 at the Fengqiu State Key Agro-ecological Experimental Station and included a control without fertilizer (CK), OM, mineral NPK fertilizer (NPK), mineral NP fertilizer (NP), and mineral NK fertilizer (NK). The proportion of N emitted as NO and N2O varied considerably among fertilizer treatments, ranging from 0.83% to 2.50% as NO and from 0.08% to 0.36% as N2O. Cumulative NO emission was highest in the CK treatment after NH (4) (+) -N was added at a rate of 200 mg N kg(-1) soil during the 612-h incubation period, whereas the long-term application of fertilizers significantly reduced NO emission by 54-67%. In contrast, the long-term application of NPK fertilizer and OM significantly enhanced N2O emission by 95.6% and 253%, respectively, compared to CK conditions. The addition of NP fertilizer (no K) significantly reduced N2O emission by 25.5%, whereas applications of NK fertilizer (no P) had no effect. The difference among the N-fertilized treatments was due probably to discrepancies in the N2O production potential of the dominant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) species rather than AOB abundance. The ratio of NO/N2O was approximately 24 in the CK treatment, significantly higher than those in the N-fertilized treatments (3-11), and it decreased with increasing N2O production potential in N-fertilized treatments. Our data suggests that the shift in the dominant AOB species might produce reciprocal change in cumulative NO and N2O emissions.

Trace gas responses of tropical forest and pasture soils to N and P fertilization. [1] We measured the responses of nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) fertilization in a mature moist tropical forest and an 11-year-old pasture in the Brazilian Amazon. Nitrogen was applied in two forms, ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). In the forest, NO emissions increased by 4 to 9 times the controls in the NH4+ amended plots. Nitrous oxide emissions showed a small response only in the NH4+ amended plots. In the pasture, NO emissions during the first 7 days after fertilization with either form of N were about twice those in the control plots. Nitrous oxide emissions increased more than 18 times the controls in the NO3- amended plots 1 day after fertilization. The estimated yields of total nitrogen oxide loss from the forest were between 0.2 and 1.6% of the applied nitrogen, predominately as NO. Pasture yields were greater, up to 2.8% of the applied nitrogen, predominately as N2O. In the context of Rondonia and other regions in the Amazon Basin, pasture management practices are changing to include increased use of fertilizer, particularly in older pastures that have lower NO and N2O emissions than the original intact forests. This may lead to large short-term releases of N2O and alter the future N2O emissions from the Basin. C1 Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.

PROCESSES REGULATING SOIL EMISSIONS OF NO AND N2O IN A SEASONALLY DRY TROPICAL FOREST. While much is known about control of production of NO and N2O by nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria at the cellular level, application of this knowledge to field studies has not yielded unifying concepts that are widely applicable and that foster understanding of global sources of these atmospheric trace gases. We applied a simple conceptual model to the investigation of sources of NO and N2O and the environmental factors affecting fluxes in a drought-deciduous forest of Mexico. Fluxes of NO and N2O were higher in the wet season than the dry season, but addition of water to dry soil caused large pulses of CO2, NO, and N2O emissions. Immediate increases of extractable soil NH4+ and high rates of gross N mineralization and gross nitrification also were observed following wetting of dry soil. Soil NO2- had accumulated during the dry season, and that NO2- plus the pulse of increased soil NH4+ were mostly consumed within 24 hours of wetting. This dynamic microbial processing of soil inorganic N coincided with the pulses of NO and N2O production following wetting of dry soil. Acetylene inhibition experiments indicated that NO production was dependent on nitrification, that nitrification was the dominant source of N2O when the soil was wetted at the end of the dry season, and that denitrification might be an important source of N2O during the wet season. Post-wetting soil moisture was correlated negatively with NO fluxes and positively with N2O fluxes. These results support a conceptual model in which N trace gas production is generally constrained by the rates of N mineralization and nitrification, while the specific ratios of NO and N2O fluxes and the contributions from nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria are controlled largely by soil moisture.

We measured NO fluxes in control and nitrogen (N) addition (NH4NO3, 6 g N m(-2) year(-1)) plots from early June through October 2013 in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau, China. During the sample period, NO fluxes varied from -0.71 to 3.12 ug m(-2) h(-1) and -0.46 to 7.54 ug m(-2) h(-1) for control and N treatment plots. The mean NO emission in N addition plots (1.68 ug m(-2) h(-1)) was 2.15 times higher than the control plots (0.78 ug m(-2) h(-1)), indicating that alpine meadows may be a source of atmospheric NO, and N additions stimulated NO flux. A positive correlation was found between NO flux and soil temperature, water-filled pore space (WFPS), nitrate (NO3--N) content but no correlation with soil ammonium (NH4+-N). These results suggest that denitrification is a principal process producing NO flux from alpine meadows.

Seasonal variations of nitric oxide flux from agricultural soils in the Southeast United States. Fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) were measured from the summer of 1994 to the spring of 1995 from an intensively managed agricultural soil using a dynamic flow through chamber technique in order to study the seasonal variability in the emissions of NO. The measurements were made on a Norfolk sandy loam (Fine-Loamy, Siliceous, Thermic Typic Paleudult) soil located at an agricultural research station in the Upper Coastal Plain region of North Carolina. Soil nitric oxide fluxes from 3 crops, representing 3 levels of fertilizer application (corn, 168 kg N ha(-1); cotton, 68 kg N ha(-1) and soybean, 0 kg N ha(-1)), were measured in each season (summer, fall, winter, and spring). Additional measured soil parameters included soil temperature, soil water content (expressed as percent water filled pore space, %WFPS), and extractable nitrogen. The greatest NO flux observed in each crop occurred during the summer (June to August) measurement period (corn, 21.9 +/- 18.6 ng N m(-2) s(-1); cotton, 4.3 +/- 3.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1); and soybean, 2.1 +/- 0.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1)). NO flux decreased in each crop through the fall months to a minimum flux in the winter. Application of fertilizer during the spring months once again produced substantial NO flux, but not as high as during the summer months. Over 80% of NO flux from the three crops measured occurred in the summer months with an estimated 5% of the nitrogen applied as fertilizer emitted as NO in a year's time. The corn crop, which had the highest amount of applied fertilizer, had the highest average yearly NO flux (7.0 +/- 4.8 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) followed by cotton and soybean in order (1.7 +/- 1.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and 1.0 +/- 0.3 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively). NO flux from soil tracked soil temperature very closely throughout the year, especially through the summer and spring months. However, NO flux measured under a cotton canopy decreased when soil temperature was >25 degrees C and soil moisture content was <20%WFPS. Overall, the data support the assumption that in the Southeast United States, which has naturally emitted VOC's and large acreages of fertilized soils, NO emissions from agricultural soils may result in the formation of tropospheric ozone, especially during the summer months when NO emissions are highest.

Three years of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from silandic andosols cultivated with maize in Hokkaido, Japan. We measured nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions during the snow-free season (April-November) over a 3-year period (1998-2000) from a Silandic Andosols Cultivated with maize (Zea mays L.) in central Hokkaido, Japan. In May, before furrowing, composted cattle manure was broadcast onto the field at a rate of 3.0 g N m(-2). After furrowing, chemical fertilizer (NH4)(2)SO4-N + (NH4)(3)PO4-N : urea-N at a ratio of 10:3 was applied to the row at a rate of 13 g N m(-2). An impermeable layer lay 1.3 in below ground level. As a result, after heavy rains and during the snow-melting period, the groundwater table rose to near the ground surface. The N2O and NO emission rates ranged from 0.0 to 6.4 and from 0.00 to 0.94 mg N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The highest N2O emission was observed after heavy rain in summer and autumn. The magnitude and seasonal pattern of N2O emissions from the inter row were similar to those from the row itself, although chemical fertilizer had not been applied to the inter row. In contrast, all increase in NO emissions was observed only from the row. Seasonal fluctuations ill Soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations and the emission ratio N2O-N/NO-N suggested that N2O and NO emitted after fertilizer application (May to early July) were produced mainly by nitrification, whereas N2O emitted after heavy rains (after mid-July) was produced mainly by derntrification. Total N2O and NO emissions during the snow-free season ranged from 0.7 to 2.8 and from 0.0 to 0.7 g N m(-2), respectively, over a 3-year period. The N2O and NO emissions from our field were relatively high compared with those reported worldwide. In contrast, reported N2O emission rates from agricultural Andosols in Japan are typically lower than those from other agricultural soils in Japan and around the world. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that high N2O emissions may occur from Japanese agricultural Andosols that are poorly drained.

An innovative soil mesocosm system for studying the effect of soil moisture and background NO on soil surface C and N trace gas fluxes. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key substance in atmospheric chemistry, influencing the formation and destruction of tropospheric ozone and the atmosphere's oxidizing capacity. It also affects the physiological functions of organisms. NO is produced, consumed, and emitted by soils, the effects of soil NO concentrations on microbial C and N cycling and associated trace gas fluxes remain largely unclear. This study describes a new automated 12-chamber soil mesocosm system that dynamically changes incoming airflow composition. It was used to investigate how varying NO concentrations affect soil microbial C and N cycling and associated trace gas fluxes under different moisture conditions (30% and 50% WFPS). Based on detection limits for NO, NO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes of < 0.5 <mu>g N or C m(-2) h(-1) and for CO2 fluxes of < 1.2 mg C m(-2 )h(-1), we found that soil CO2, CH4, NO, NO2, and N2O were significantly affected by different soil moisture levels. After 17 days cumulative fluxes at 50% WFPS increased by 40, 400, and 500% for CO2, N2O, and CH4, respectively, when compared to 30% WFPS. However, cumulative fluxes for NO, and NO2, decreased by 70, and 40%, respectively, at 50% WFPS when compared to 30% WFPS. Different NO concentrations tended to decrease soil C and N fluxes by about 10-20%. However, with the observed variability among individual soil mesocosms and minor fluxes change. In conclusion, the developed system effectively investigates how and to what extent soil NO concentrations affect soil processes and potential plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere.

Emissions of N2O and NO and net nitrogen mineralization in a boreal forested peatland treated with different nitrogen compounds. Fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured on a drained and forested peatland in 1992-1995. Net mineralization and nitrification were studied in situ in 1993-1994. Nitrogen additions in 1992 as KNO3, NH4Cl, or urea (100 kg N.ha(-1)) were used to study the fate and transformations of N in peat. The mean N2O emissions during the growth season in 1993 were 1.9, 2.6, 3.3, and 3.5 mg N.m(-2).day(-1) in the control soil, KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea-treated soils, respectively.

Annual net N mineralization was 87 kg N.ha(-1) in the control soil and 107, 129, and 91 kg.ha(-1) in the KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea-treated soils, respectively. Added N increased the fluxes of N oxides at least for a year after the treatments. The study showed that forests on drained N-rich peat soils may be significant sources of N2O and NO and that their production of nitrogenous trace gases is enhanced by additional N.

Nitrous and nitric oxide emissions from a cornfield and managed grassland: 11 years of continuous measurement with manure and fertilizer applications, and land-use change. Changes in weather and management practices such as manure and fertilizer applications have a major effect on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from soils. N2O and NO emissions exhibit high intra- and inter-annual fluctuations, which are also highly influenced by land-use change. In this study we investigated how land-use change between grassland and cornfield affects soil N2O and NO emissions using long-term field measurements in a mollic andosol soil in Southern Hokkaido, Japan. Soil N2O and NO emissions were monitored for 5years in a 30-year old grassland (OG), which was then plowed and converted to a cornfield for 3years and then converted back to grassland (new grassland, NG) for another 3years. We established four treatment plots: control, without any nitrogen (N) input (CT plot); chemical fertilizer only (F plot); chemical fertilizer and manure (MF plot); and manure only (M plot).Changing land use from OG to cornfield increased annual N2O emissions by 6-7 times, while the change from cornfield to NG resulted in a 0.3-0.6 times reduction in annual N2O emissions. N2O emissions in the newly established grassland were 2-5 times higher than those in the 30-year old grassland. Soil mineral N (NO3- and NH4+) was higher in cornfield, followed by NG and lowest in OG, while water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) did not significantly change with changing land use but tended to be higher in OG and NG than in cornfield. The ratio of WEOC to soil NO3- was the most important explanatory variable for differences in N2O emissions as land use changed. High N input, surplus soil N, and precipitation and low soil pH led to increased N2O emissions. N2O emissions in fertilizer- and/or manure-amended plots were 3-4, 2-5 and 1.4-2 times higher than those in the control treatment in OG, cornfield and NG, respectively. NO emissions were largely influenced by soil mineral N and N addition, and showed less response to changing land use. There were high inter-annual variations in both NO and N2O emissions in all plots, including the control treatment, highlighting the need for long-term measurements when determining local emission rates.

EMISSIONS OF NO FROM SOIL AT A RURAL SITE IN CENTRAL TENNESSEE. Field measurements of soil emissions of NO from a Mountview silt loam soil with three land uses (forest, fertilized pasture, and fertilized corn) were made on a commercial farm during a summer and autumn sampling period. A new automated closed-chamber sampling system was developed to allow simultaneous measurements on five chambers per 100 m2 plot. Individual chambers with hinged tops, covering 0.3 m2 of soil area were pneumatically operated via data logger control to sample soil NO flux every third hour. Spatial variability in emission rates was high. For each land use type the range from the lowest to the highest emitting chamber was approximately threefold. Land use type significant affected soil NO emissions. The fertilized pasture had the highest mean emission rate (44.1 ng N m-2 s-1), followed by the fertilized com (27.0 ng N m-2 s-1), and the forest (8.4 ng N m-2 s-1). NO emission rates and soil nitrate levels at the forest plot were considerably higher than at other forest sites in the region, possibly due to runoff from an adjacent fertilized hayfield. The results of this study, when extrapolated to a regional estimate, suggest that emissions of NO from soils could play a significant role in summertime tropospheric ozone photochemistry in the southeastern United States. ", "Do NO, N2O, N2 and N2 fluxes differ in soils sourced from cropland and varying riparian buffer vegetation? An incubation study. Do NO, N2O, N2 and N2 fluxes differ in soils sourced from cropland and varying riparian buffer vegetation? An incubation study. Riparian buffers are expedient interventions for water quality functions in agricultural landscapes. However, the choice of vegetation and management affects soil microbial communities, which in turn affect nutrient cycling and the production and emission of gases such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen gas (N-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). To investigate the potential fluxes of the above-mentioned gases, soil samples were collected from a cropland and downslope grass, willow and woodland riparian buffers from a replicated plot scale experimental facility. The soils were re-packed into cores and to investigate their potential to produce the aforementioned gases via potential denitrification, a potassium nitrate (KNO3-) and glucose (labile carbon)-containing amendment, was added prior to incubation in a specialized laboratory DENItrification System (DENIS). The resulting NO, N2O, N-2 and CO2 emissions were measured simultaneously, with the most NO (2.9 & PLUSMN; 0.31 mg NO m(-2)) and N2O (1413.4 & PLUSMN; 448.3 mg N2O m(-2)) generated by the grass riparian buffer and the most N-2 (698.1 & PLUSMN; 270.3 mg N-2 m(-2)) and CO2 (27,558.3 & PLUSMN; 128.9 mg CO2 m(-2)) produced by the willow riparian buffer. Thus, the results show that grass riparian buffer soils have a greater NO3- removal capacity, evidenced by their large potential denitrification rates, while the willow riparian buffers may be an effective riparian buffer as its soils potentially promote complete denitrification to N-2, especially in areas with similar conditions to the current study.

Controls over N2O, NOx and CO2 fluxes in a calcareous mountain forest soil. We measured nitrogen oxides (N2O and NOx), dinitrogen (N-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a C spruce-fir-beech forest soil in the North Tyrolean limestone Alps in Austria. The site received 10.6-11.9 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) nitrogen as bulk deposition. Fluxes of nitric oxide N were measured by an automatic dynamic chamber system on an hourly basis over a two year period. Daily N2O emissions were obtained by a semi-automatic gas measuring system. In order to cover spatial variability biweekly manual measurements of N2O and CO2 emissions were carried out in addition. For acquiring information on the effects of soil and meteorological conditions and of N-deposition on N-emissions we chose the auto-regression procedure (time-series analysis) as our means of investigation. Hence, we could exclude the data's autocorrelation in the course of the time. We found that soil temperature, soil moisture and bulk N-deposition followed by air temperature and precipitation were the most powerful influencing parameters effecting N-emissions. With these variables, up to 89% of observed temporal variations of N-emissions could be explained. During the two-year investigation period between 2.5 and 3.5% of deposited N was reemitted in form of N2O whereas only 0.2% were emitted as NO. At our mountain forest site the main end-product of microbial activity processes was N-2 and trace gases (N2O and NO) were only of minor importance.

Evaluation of uncertainties in N2O and NO fluxes from agricultural soil using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Agricultural soil is the major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). However, N2O and NO fluxes from the soil show high spatial and temporal variability. Therefore, traditional statistical tools are insufficient for evaluating the strength of the emissions and determining the environmental and management factors affecting these fluxes. To compensate for the inherent variability of N oxide fluxes in situ, we proposed the application of a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model based on a simple semi-mechanistic model with a lognormal probability distribution. We applied the HB model to the daily N2O and NO fluxes from an Andosol soil field to which a chemical N fertilizer was applied. In addition, we evaluated the responses of these fluxes to environmental factors and N application. The posterior inference revealed various sensitivities to the soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) among the N oxide gas fluxes. The N2O flux showed a higher temperature dependency compared with the NO flux. The estimated optimum WFPS of the NO flux (54.1% with credible interval (CI) 95%, from 47.1% to 79.4%) was lower than that of the N2O flux (75.8% with CI 95%, from 54.1% to 98.3%) in this soil sample. Although control plots without N fertilizer application are usually required to calculate the fertilizer-induced emission factor (EF), our HB model could estimate EFs and their uncertainties using posterior simulations (for N2O 0.077% with CI 95% high probability density, from 0.056% to 0.191%; for NO 0.875% with CI 95% high probability density, from 0.552% to 2.05%). Our HB model can be easily applied to the observations of the N2O and NO fluxes because it requires only several explanatory variables and can be used to evaluate the flux uncertainties and responses of the nonlinear N oxide fluxes to environmental factors.

NO VERSUS N2O EMISSIONS FROM AN NH-4+-AMENDED BERMUDA GRASS PASTURE. We used an enclosure technique to monitor soil NO and N2O emissions during early summer regrowth of Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) on sandy loam in a humid, subtropical region of southern Texas. The evolution of both gases was substantially higher from plots harvested at the beginning of the experiment and fertilized 5 days later with 52 kg N ha-1 as (NH4)2SO4 than from plots not harvested or fertilized. Emission of NO, but not N2O, was stimulated by clipping and removing the grass, probably because eliminating the shading provided by the dense grass canopy changed these plots from cooler to warmer than unharvested plots, thereby stimulating the activity of soil microorganisms responsible for NO production. Neither gas flux was significantly affected by application of N until the next rainfall dissolved and moved the surface-applied fertilizer into the soil. Immediately thereafter, emissions of NO and N2O increased dramatically to peaks of 160 and 12 g N ha-1 d-1 respectively, and then declined at rates that closely paralleled the nitrification rate of added NH4+, indicating that the gases resulted from the activity of nitrifying microorganisms, rather than denitrifiers. Nitric oxide emissions during the 9-week measurement period averaged 7.2 times greater than N2O emissions and accounted for 3.2% of the added N. The data indicate that humid, subtropical grasslands, which not only have large geographical extent but also have been subject to intense anthropogenic disturbance, contribute significantly to the global atmospheric NOx budget.

Evaluation of data from intact soil cores. Nitrogen oxide trace gas transport and transformation: 1. Evaluation of data from intact soil cores. Once emitted to the atmosphere, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) regulate several important processes in the troposphere and stratosphere. Understanding controls over N oxide gas emissions from fertilized soils is often complicated by highly heterogeneous and dynamic field conditions. An intact soil core method is described here for examining multiple subsurface controls concurrently with N oxide surface fluxes under hydrostatic and isothermal conditions dominated by Fickian diffusive transport. The method allows for simultaneous measurement of inorganic N levels, pH, water content, and soil-gas concentrations of NO, N(2)O, O(2), and CO(2) and for subsequent calculation of N mass balances, net nitrification rates, CO(2) respiration rates, O(2) uptake rates, fraction of nitrified N lost as gas, and anaerobic microsite fraction profiles. The method is applied to moderately acidic soil fertilized with anhydrous ammonia. Steady nitrification and persistent NO(2)(-) levels resulted in NO gaseous losses representing 22-37% of the inorganic N initially present and >50% of the nitrified N. Of the initial N mass present, 96-119% was accounted for as N solutes and gases. High N(2)O soil-gas concentrations (5-20 mg N m(-3)) and fluxes (1 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) persisted despite anaerobic fractions of less than or equal to 10(-10) m(3) anaerobic Soil m(-3) soil, suggesting that N(2)O sources other than denitrification were important.

Effects of tillage during the nonwaterlogged period on nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions in typical Chinese rice-wheat rotation ecosystems. Tillage practices result in major changes to soil environmental conditions and to the distribution of crop residues and nutrients in the soil profile, which may consequently affect the biogenic production and emission of N trace gases. To investigate the effects of tillage during the nonwaterlogged period on nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in rice-wheat rotation systems, we performed field experiments at three sites (Suzhou, Wuxi, and Jiangdu) in the Yangtze River Delta using static chamber techniques. The results showed that the effect of tillage on the emissions of both gases differed among the three field sites due to differences in agricultural management and soil texture. At the site with a light soil texture (Jiangdu: sandy loam), no tillage resulted in reduced NO emissions (0.5 kg N ha(-1)) as compared to conventionally tilled fields (0.9 kg N ha(-1); p < 0.05). Regarding N2O, the no tillage plots showed significantly higher emissions (p < 0.05) in comparison to the tilled plots (3.9 versus 2.2 kg N ha(-1)) when the fields were merely amended with synthetic N fertilizers. However, this effect was not significant when wheat straw was used in addition to synthetic N fertilizers during the preceding rice season. In the clay loam soils (Wuxi), no tillage resulted in lower NO and higher N2O emissions from either N fertilized or unfertilized fields even though these results were not statistically significant. In the silty clay loam soils (Suzhou), which showed the highest soil organic carbon contents and the highest rates of N trace gas emissions in all three of the investigated sites, reduced tillage resulted in much higher NO emissions, whereas N2O emissions were not obviously influenced by tillage practices (reduced tillage versus tillage: NO, 9.5 versus 5.4 kg N ha(-1); N2O, 10.6 versus 9.0 kg N ha(-1)). Similar effects of tillage were observed for the direct emission factors of the applied N during the wheat season. The observed emission factors for the different sites ranged from 0.3% to 2.4% for N2O (mean: 1.0%) and from 0.1% to 4.0% (mean: 0.9%) for NO, respectively. The observed site-to-site differences in emission factors are most likely the results of variations in soil properties (such as texture and pH) and agricultural practices (such as tillage and crop residue management) or in the amount and pattern of precipitation.

Stimulation of NO and N2O emissions from soils by SO2 deposition. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere has been demonstrated to have many adverse impacts on the environment and human health. In this study, deposition of SO2 ranging from 9.0 to 127.8 similar to mg similar to kg-1 with an average of 35.7 similar to mg similar to S similar to kg-1 was found to substantially stimulate NO and N2O emissions from soils in the humid subtropical areas of Hainan, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Yunnan provinces of China under field conditions. Laboratory tests indicated that the stimulations were mediated biologically as the effects were not observed in sterilized soils. Acidification of soil resulting from SO2 deposition was not responsible for the stimulated NO and N2O emissions alone as the stimulation did not occur by acidifying soil with HNO3 treatment. By using the 15N tracing method, we found that the N2O emissions stimulated by SO2 deposition were from either denitrification, heterotrophic nitrification or both, but not from autotrophic nitrification. Therefore, atmospheric SO2 deposition would most likely stimulate NO and N2O emissions in acidic soils in which heterotrophic nitrification dominates NO and N2O production and waterlogged soils in which denitrification dominates NO and N2O production.

Under dry pre-incubation conditions NO and N2O emissions were very low (< 7.0 +/- 5.0 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1); < 0.0 +/- 1.4 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) or in the case of N2O, even a net soil uptake was observed. Substantial NO (max: 306.5 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and relatively small N2O pulse emissions (max: 5.8 +/- 5.0 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) were recorded following soil wetting, but these pulses were short lived, lasting only up to 3 days. The total atmospheric loss of nitrogen was generally dominated by N-2 emissions (82.4-99.3% of total N lost), although NO emissions contributed almost 43.2% to the total atmospheric nitrogen loss at 50% SM and 30 degrees C ST incubation settings (the contribution of N-2 at these soil conditions was only 53.2 %). N2O emissions were systematically higher for 3 of 12 sample locations, which indicates substantial spatial variability at site level, but on average soils acted as weak N2O sources or even sinks. By using a conservative upscale approach we estimate total annual emissions from savanna soils to average 0.12 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (N2O), 0.68 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (NO) and 6.65 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (N-2). The analysis of long-term SM and ST records makes it clear that extreme soil saturation that can lead to high N2O and N-2 emissions only occurs a few days per year and thus has little impact on the annual total. The potential contribution of nitrogen released due to pulse events compared to the total annual emissions was found to be of importance for NO emissions (contribution to total: 5-22 %), but not for N2O emissions. Our results indicate that the total gaseous release of nitrogen from these soils is low and clearly dominated by loss in the form of inert nitrogen. Effects of seasonally varying soil temperature and moisture were detected, but were found to be low due to the small amounts of available nitrogen in the soils (total nitrogen < 0.1 %).

Microbial mechanisms and ecosystem flux estimation for aerobic NOy emissions from deciduous forest soils. Reactive nitrogen oxides (NOy; NOy = NO + NO2 + HONO) decrease air quality and impact radiative forcing, yet the factors responsible for their emission from nonpoint sources (i.e., soils) remain poorly understood. We investigated the factors that control the production of aerobic NOy in forest soils using molecular techniques, process-based assays, and inhibitor experiments. We subsequently used these data to identify hotspots for gas emissions across forests of the eastern United States. Here, we show that nitrogen oxide soil emissions are mediated by microbial community structure (e.g., ammonium oxidizer abundances), soil chemical characteristics (pH and C:N), and nitrogen (N) transformation rates (net nitrification). We find that, while nitrification rates are controlled primarily by chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), the production of NOy is mediated in large part by chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Variation in nitrification rates and nitrogen oxide emissions tracked variation in forest communities, as stands dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees had greater N transformation rates and NOy fluxes than stands dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. Given mapped distributions of AM and ECM trees from 78,000 forest inventory plots, we estimate that broadleaf forests of the Midwest and the eastern United States as well as the Mississippi River corridor may be considered hotspots of biogenic NOy emissions. Together, our results greatly improve our understanding of NOy fluxes from forests, which should lead to improved predictions about the atmospheric consequences of tree species shifts owing to land management and climate change.

Biochar modified water-retaining agent polyacrylamide reduced NO but not N2O emissions from Camellia oleifera plantation soil. Camellia oleifera, an important woody oil crop, is primarily grown in the acidic laterite regions. As an economic plantation distributed in subtropical area where characterized by seasons with high temperature and low precipitation, ensuring adequate soil moisture is pivotal for achieving high and stable yields in C. oleifera plantation soil, which potentially impact soil gaseous nitrogen emissions associated with global climate change. However, few studies have been reported on the impact of modified water-retaining agents on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. This study aims to investigate the effects of water-retaining agent polyacrylamide (PAM) and C. oleifera fruit shell-derived biochar-modified PAM (MP) on soil water retention ability and the emissions of N2O and NO from C. oleifera plantation soil. Specifically, the effects of PAM (0.4 %oPAM, and 1 %o PAM) and biochar-modified PAM (4 %MP, 10%MP) on the emissions of N2O and NO, soil physicochemical properties, and the abundance of relevant microbial functional genes in C. oleifera plantation soil was examined. The results indicated that both PAM and biochar modified PAM significantly altered soil moisture, soil physicochemical properties, and the abundance of associated microbial functional genes. Soil NO emissions were reduced by 15.90 %, 18.54 %, 16.01 %, and 30.34 % by the application of 0.4%o, 1%o, 4 % ModiPAM, and 10 % ModiPAM, respectively. The application of the modified water-retaining agents increased soil moisture, reduced soil NO emissions by affecting the abundance of functional genes involved in nitrification and denitrification processes via increases in soil pH. The application of water-retaining agents, especially MP, offers a beneficial approach to soil moisture management and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The optimal ratio and application methods of water-retaining agents should be explored by future studies to maximize benefits.

Different pathways of formation of N2O, N2 and NO in black earth soil. The use of N-15 tracer provides a suitable technique to investigate the processes of N transformation in soils and the origin of the environmentally relevant gaseous N compounds N2O and NO from nitrification and denitrification. incubation experiments with black earth soil under two different water contents are presented here. Nitrification and denitrification proceeded simultaneously, but the importance of these two microbial processes shifted depending on the water content of the soil. Under water-unsaturated conditions the microbial oxidation of NH4+ to NO3- predominated, but a reduction of NO3- also occurred. The emission of NO exceeded the emission of N2O by a factor of up to 20 at the beginning of the experiments. Under water-saturated conditions denitrification was the dominant process of N transformation in the soil. However, nitrification also occurred to a considerable extent. The emission of N2O was greater than under unsaturated conditions. The formation of NO could hardly be observed. N loss by molecular nitrogen from denitrification could be detected under saturated conditions. The N loss amounted to 60% of NO3- and thereby the cumulative N ratio of N-2 to N2O was 3. Under either unsaturated or saturated conditions NO arose from NO2- or during the microbial oxidation of NH4+ to NO2-. However, N2O mainly formed from denitrification under both conditions. Furthermore, NO could not be observed as a precursor of N2O and the free NO2- could not be detected as a common N pool for the formation of N2O and NO. High emissions of NO could be a problem for the black earth soil in the semi-arid climate in central Germany, if there are large amounts of NH4+ in the soil after fertilisation.

Linking Nitrous Oxide and Nitric Oxide Fluxes to Microbial Communities in Tropical Forest Soils and Oil Palm Plantations in Malaysia in Laboratory Incubations. Current understanding of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes associated with land-use change from forest to oil palm on mineral soil is not sufficient to provide reliable estimates of emission rates or advice on GHG mitigation strategies. Monocultures of oil palm have expanded in Southeast Asia, mostly replacing tropical forests. The limited data available have indicated that the land-use conversion is associated with a potentially aggravated GHG burden, including nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, with unclear underlying biological mechanisms. In this study, we investigated N2O and NO emission potentials of tropical soils with different land-uses from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, under laboratory incubation. Under similar controlled conditions, logged forest and oil palm soils showed high and similar potentials of N2O and NO emissions following increase in soil moisture, while the emissions were negligible in a riparian reserve soil irrespective of moisture conditions. Soil N2O and NO emission rates from logged forest soils and oil palm (OP) plantations were of similar magnitude, with average fluxes over the 35 and 22 day incubation periods, respectively, of 11.5 and 1.6 ng N g(-1) h(-1) (OP) and 15.6 and 6.0 ng N g(-1) h(-1) (logged forest). Contrarily, the riparian reserve soil did not respond to rewetting and nitrogen application and fluxes were negligible. Furthermore, N2O fluxes were on average about 10 times higher than NO fluxes. The fact that forest soils also have the potential to emit large amounts of N2O and NO, has important implications for land-use change scenarios in the tropics, especially as some scenarios suggest atmospheric N deposition is likely to drastically increase in tropical regions due to biomass burning, increased N-fertilizer use and fossil fuel consumption. Quantification of related gene transcripts implied that Proteobacterial nirS and AniA-nirK (betaproteobacterial clade of Neisseria) containing denitrifiers might continuously contribute to the N2O emissions, while the nitrifiers (ammonia oxidizing archaea in this study) are conditionally active to produce N2O. This study therefore provides some evidence for N2O and NO emissions associated with phylogenetically diverse groups of microorganisms, which might be of importance in modulating the GHG emissions under different land-uses and field conditions.

Effect of ammonium and nitrate application on the NO and N2O emission out of different soils. The effect of nitrate and ammonium application (0, 50, 100 and 150 mg N kg(-1) soil) was studied in an incubation experiment. Four Belgian soils, selected for different soil characteristics, were used. The application of both nitrate and ammonium caused an increase of the NO and N2O emission. The NO production from nitrate and ammonium was found to be of the same order of magnitude. At low pH the NO production was found to be highest from nitrate, at higher pH values the production was found to be higher from ammonium. This seems to be the result of the negative effect of low pH on nitrification. The ANOVA analysis was carried out to separate the effect of the form of nitrogen, quantity of N applied and soil characteristics. The total production of NO was found to depend for 97% on the soil characteristics and for 3% on the quantity of N added. The total N2O production depended for 100% on the soil characteristics. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the total NO production was best predicted by a combination of the factors CaCO3 content and NH4+ concentration in the soil. Total N2O production was best described by a combination of CaCO3, water soluble carbon (WSC) and sand-content. The N2O/NO ratio was found to be highly variable, indicating that their productions react differently to changes in conditions, or are partly independent. It may be concluded that to NO and N2O from soils both nitrification and denitrification may be equally important, their relative importance depending on local conditions such as substrate availability, water content of the soil etc. However, the NO production seems to be more nitrification dependent than the N2O production. denitrification; greenhouse gas; nitric oxide; nitrification; nitrous oxide", "Improving nitrogen cycling in a land surface model (CLM5) to quantify soil N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions from enhanced rock weathering with croplands. Improving nitrogen cycling in a land surface model (CLM5) to quantify soil N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions from enhanced rock weathering with croplands. Surficial enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategy that involves applying crushed silicate rock (e.g., basalt) to agricultural soils. However, unintended biogeochemical interactions with the nitrogen cycle may arise through ERW increasing soil pH as basalt grains undergo dissolution that may reinforce, counteract, or even offset the climate benefits from carbon sequestration. Increases in soil pH could drive changes in the soil emissions of key non-CO2 greenhouse gases, e.g., nitrous oxide (N2O), and trace gases, e.g., nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3), that affect air quality and crop and human health. We present the development and implementation of a new improved nitrogen cycling scheme for the Community Land Model v5 (CLM5), the land component of the Community Earth System Model, allowing evaluation of ERW effects on soil gas emissions. We base the new parameterizations on datasets derived from soil pH responses of N2O, NO, and NH3 in ERW field trial and mesocosm experiments with crushed basalt. These new capabilities involve the direct implementation of routines within the CLM5 N cycle framework, along with asynchronous coupling of soil pH changes estimated through an ERW model. We successfully validated simulated \"control\" (i.e., no ERW) seasonal cycles of soil N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions against a wide range of global emission inventories. We benchmark simulated mitigation of soil N2O fluxes in response to ERW against a subset of data from ERW field trials in the US Corn Belt. Using the new scheme, we provide a specific example of the effect of large-scale ERW deployment with croplands on soil nitrogen fluxes across five key regions with high potential for CDR with ERW (North America, Brazil, Europe, India, and China). Across these regions, ERW implementation led to marked reductions in N2O and NO (both 18%), with moderate increases in NH3 (2%). While further developments are still required in our implementations when additional ERW data become available, our improved N cycle scheme within CLM5 has utility for investigating the potential of ERW point-source and regional effects of soil N2O, NO, and NH3 fluxes in response to current and future climates. This framework also provides the basis for assessing the implications of ERW for air quality given the role of NO in tropospheric ozone formation, as well as both NO and NH3 in inorganic aerosol formation.

Effect of management, climate and soil conditions on N2O and NO emissions from an arable crop rotation using high temporal resolution measurements. Quantifying the nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes emitted from croplands remains a major challenge. Field measurements in different climates, soil and agricultural conditions are still scarce and emissions are generally assessed from a small number of measurements. In this study, we report continuously measured N2O and NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over a 2-year crop sequence of barley and maize in northern France. Measurements were carried out using 6 automatic chambers at a rate of 16 mean flux measurements per day. Additional laboratory measurements on soil cores were conducted to study the response of NO and N2O emissions to environmental conditions. The detection limit of the chamber setup was found to be 3 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for N2O and 0.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for NO. Nitrous oxide fluxes were higher than the threshold 37% of the time, while they were 72% of the time for NO fluxes. The cumulated annual NO and N2O emissions were 1.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 0.5 kg NO-N ha(-1) in 2007, but 2.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 0.7 kg NO-N ha(-1) in 2008. These inter-annual differences were largely related to crop types and to their respective management practices. The forms, amounts and timing of nitrogen applications and the mineralization of organic matter by incorporation of crop residues were found to be the main factor controlling the emissions peaks. The inter-annual variability was also due to different weather conditions encountered in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, the fractioned N inputs applied on barley (54 kg ha(-1) in March and in April) did not generate N2O emissions peaks because of the low rainfall during the spring. However, the significant rainfall observed in the summer and fall of 2007, promoted rapid decomposition of barley residues which caused high levels of N2O emissions. In 2008, the application of dairy cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer before the emergence of maize (107 kg N-min ha(-1) or 130 kg N-tot ha(-1) in all) coincided with large rainfalls promoting both NO and N2O emissions, which remained high until early summer. Laboratory measurements corroborated the field observations: NO fluxes were maximum at a water-filled pore space (WFPS) of around 27% while N2O fluxes were optimal at 68% WFPS, with a maximum potentially 14 times larger than for NO.

Nitrifier controls on soil NO and N2O emissions in three chaparral ecosystems under contrasting atmospheric N inputs. High rates of atmospheric N deposition can increase ecosystem N availability and stimulate N losses from soils via nitric oxide (NO; an air pollutant at high concentrations) and nitrous oxide (N2O; a strong greenhouse gas) emissions as predicted by N saturation theory. However, it remains unclear whether theories developed in mesic ecosystems apply to drylands, where plant N uptake and N availability are often decoupled. NO and N2O are produced during the oxidation of ammonia (i.e., nitrification) by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) or ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Because AOB may be favored in N-rich environments and may emit more NO and N2O than AOA, high atmospheric N inputs may favor both NO and N2O emissions. To assess whether atmospheric N deposition favors AOB- and AOA-derived N emissions, we selectively inhibited AOA and AOB and measured NO and N2O from soils collected from three dryland sites exposed to relatively low (3.8 kg ha(-1) = Low N) or high (11.8 kg ha(-1) = High N-A; 15.6 kg ha(-1) = High N-B) atmospheric N inputs. We found that while the High N-B deposition site had the lowest AOA:AOB ratio (2.3 +/- 0.6), consistent with expectations, this site did not emit the most NO and N2O. Rather, AOA emitted between 21 and 78% of the NO from our sites, with higher AOA-derived NO emissions from relatively coarse-textured soils in the Low N deposition site. In addition to nitrification, other processes also emitted NO and N2O, especially in the High N-A site where non-nitrifier NO and N2O emissions were similar to 2-4 x higher than the other sites, and where finer textured soils may favor denitrification. Interactions between soil texture and N availability, rather than shifts in nitrifier communities, likely determine whether atmospheric N deposition is retained in these dryland sites or reemitted to the atmosphere as NO or N2O.

The coupling interaction of NO2- with NH4+ or NO3- as an important source of N2O emission from agricultural soil in the North China Plain. NO2- plays a crucial role in regulating N2O formation from the soil, while how it affects the production of soil N2O is still not well understood. In this study, N2O and NO emissions from an agricultural field of the North China Plain (NCP) were comparatively investigated under live different fertilizer treatments (NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+ + NO2- and NO3- + NO2-). Additionally, soil NH4+, NO2- and NO3- concentrations and the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen cycling were also analyzed in the incubation experiment. The results showed that the N2O average fluxes from the complex treatments of NO2- + NO3- were 1.4-2.4 times the sum of those from the separate treatments of NO2- and NO3- whereas from the complex treatments of NO2- + NH4+ were a factor of 1 - 1.4 larger than those from the separate treatments of NO(2)( )(-)and NH4+, indicating the coupling interaction of NO2- with NH4+ or NO3- makes a remarkable contribution to N2O emission from the soil. Significant reduction of the activity of N2O reductase was found in the soil with the addition of NO2-, which favored the accumulation of N2O formed through nitrification of NH4+ and denitrification of NO2-, resulting in relatively high N2O emissions from the complex treatments. As the intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification, NO2- produced is also expected to interact with NH(4)( )(+)or NO3- to promote N2O emission from the soil, especially during fertilization events when NO2- is easily accumulated due to the acceleration of the nitrification and denitrification processes.

Nitric and nitrous oxide fluxes following bovine urine deposition to summer-grazed pasture. Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, referred to collectively as NOx, cause decreases in methane and increases in tropospheric ozone. The net negative radiative forcing that ensues is dependent on NOx flux magnitude, location and season. This study aimed to determine if urine-N rate affected NOx or nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes following dairy cattle urine application to a temperate pasture soil under summer conditions (mean monthly rainfall 45 mm; mean air temperatures 17 degrees C, range 11-22 degrees C). An in situ experiment consisting of three treatments (control, bovine urine at 543 and 1086 kg N/ha) was replicated thrice in a randomised complete block design.

Nitrogen oxide emissions from a banana plantation in the humid tropics. Use of nitrogen fertilizer is thought to contribute significantly to the increase of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). While the current increase of fertilizer use is concentrated in tropical areas, nearly all studies of nitrogen oxide emissions have been conducted in agricultural systems in temperate areas. We measured N2O and NO fluxes from a fertilized banana plantation in the humid tropics of Costa Rica, where 360 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) is applied. Using chamber techniques, we sampled an Andisol and an Inceptisol on a monthly basis. Twice on each soil type, we sampled intensively in time following fertilizer applications. There is a strong spatial and temporal dependence of nitrogen oxide emissions on place and time of fertilizer application. We fmd greater mean N2O and NO emissions from the Andisol (31.4 ng N2O-N cm(-2) h(-1) and 55.6 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1)) than from the Inceptisol (9.3 ng N2O-N cm(-2) h(-1) and 41.1 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1)) under the plants where fertilizer is typically applied. The percentages of applied fertilizer-N that are converted into nitrogen oxide (''yield'') are between 1.26 and 2.91% for N2O and between 5.09 and 5.66% for NO depending on soil type. We consistently calculate higher nitrogen oxide yields based on intensive sampling versus monthly sampling. Temporal variation in nitrogen oxide emissions probably causes monthly sampling to underestimate mean annual fluxes. Our results suggest that in some tropical systems a higher percentage of applied nitrogen may be lost in gaseous form than in temperate agriculture. Current global estimates of N2O and NO sources from tropical agriculture are based on information from temperate areas and may cause an underestimate of the contribution of tropical agriculture to the budgets of these trace gases.

Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions and nitrogen use efficiency as affected by nitrogen placement in lowland rice fields. Urea deep placement (UDP) has demonstrated its benefits of saving N fertilizer and increasing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and grain yields. However, studies on its environmental impacts, particularly on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), are limited. We conducted multi-location field experiments in Bangladesh to determine the effects of UDP versus broadcast prilled urea (PU) on N2O and NO emissions, NUE, and rice yields. N2O and NO emissions were measured from three N fertilizer treatments-no N, UDP, and PU-using automated gas sampling and analysis systems continuously for two rice-growing seasons-Aus (May-August) and Aman (August-December). Fertilizer-induced peaks in N2O emissions were observed after broadcast application of PU but were rarely observed after UDP. Total seasonal N2O and NO emissions, yield-scaled emissions, and fertilizer-induced emissions were affected by fertilizer treatments and sites. Though nitrogen fertilizer increased emissions significantly over the control, emissions resulting from UDP and PU were similar. Effects of N placement on grain yields and NUE were site- and season-specific. Of the N placement methods, UDP increased grain yields by 13% (p < 0.05) during the Aman season and gave similar yields in spite of lower N application during the Aus season. UDP increased N recovery from 25 and 16% of broadcast PU to 61 and 73% during the Aus and the Aman seasons, respectively in one site, but was similar in another site. On the other hand, alternate wetting and drying irrigation reduced grain yield and N recovery at the BRRI site during the Aman season. C1 [Gaihre, Yam Kanta; Satter, M.

GB3019. Statistical modeling of global soil NOx emissions - art. no. GB3019. On the basis of field measurements of NOx emissions from soils, we developed a statistical model to describe the influences of soil organic carbon (SOC) content, soil pH, land-cover type, climate, and nitrogen input on NOx emission. While also considering the effects of soil temperature, soil moisture change-induced pulse emission, and vegetation fire, we simulated NOx emissions from global soils at resolutions of 0.5 degrees and 6 hours. Canopy reduction was included in both data processing and flux simulation. NOx emissions were positively correlated with SOC content and negatively correlated with soil pH. Soils in dry or temperate regions had higher NOx emission potentials than soils in cold or tropical regions. Needleleaf forest and agricultural soils had high NOx emissions. The annual NOx emission from global soils was calculated to be 7.43 Tg N, decreasing to 4.97 Tg N after canopy reduction. Global averages of nitrogen fertilizer-induced emission ratios were 1.16% above soil and 0.70% above canopy. Soil moisture change-induced pulse emission contributed about 4% to global annual NOx emission, and the effect of vegetation fire on soil NOx emission was negligible.

Contrasting response of two forest soils to nitrogen input: rapidly altered NO and N2O emissions and nirK abundance. Denitrification represents one of the main microbial processes producing the primary and secondary greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) in soils. It is well established that abiotic factors like the soil water content and the availability of nitrogen (N) are key parameters determining the activity of denitrifiers in soils. However, soils differing regarding their characteristics such as the content of C-org, the soil texture or the pH value may respond in specific manners to equivalent changes in soil moisture and N input. Thus, short-term incubation experiments were performed to test and compare the capacity of two contrasting Austrian forest soils to respond to mineral N application at increased soil water contents. Soils from the pristine Rothwald forest (rich in C-org) and the more acidic Schottenwald forest (poor in C-org) were amended with either NH (4) (+) -N or NO (3) (-) -N and were incubated at 40% and 70% water-filled pore space for 4 days. Changes in mineral N pools, nitrite reductase activity and NO and N2O emission rates were measured, and the abundance and structural community composition of the functional group involved in nitrite reduction were analysed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the nirK gene. Rapid and distinct activity responses to increased soil moisture and altered mineral nitrogen availability were observed in two contrasting forest soils. In both soils, nitrogen oxide emission rates were stimulated by N inputs and, depending on the soil moisture status, either NO or N2O emission was prevailing. However, different N cycling processes appeared to predominate in either soil under equivalent treatment. Nitrogen oxide emissions peaked following NO (3) (-) application in Schottenwald soils but were the highest after NH (4) (+) application in Rothwald soils. Denitrifying (nirK) communities differed significantly in Rothwald and Schottenwald soils; however, changes in the community structure were marginal during the short-term incubation. Abundances of nirK genes remained unaffected by N application in either soil. The soil water content affected nirK gene abundances only in Rothwald soil, indicating a distinct reaction of nitrite reducing communities in the two soils.

Denitrification and its product composition in typical Chinese paddy soils. Denitrification and its products composition were evaluated in four typical Chinese paddy soils with pH (H2O) ranging from 4.80 to 8.29 after application of 50 or 100 mg kg(-1) soil (KNO3)-N-15 and subsequent anaerobic incubation. Denitrification rates, which were indicated by nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen gas (N-2) production, significantly varied among different paddy soils. The denitrification rates of the neutral and alkaline paddy soils were 2.6 to 16.6 times higher, respectively, than those of acidic paddies. Furthermore, denitrification in paddy soils could produce end products other than N-2, and the product composition depended on the paddy soil type. The percentage of total N gases (NO + N2O + N-2) present as N2O was negatively and linearly correlated with denitrification rate (P < 0.05). Soil pH and C/N showed positive effects on denitrification rate (r = 0.800 and r = 0.781, respectively, P < 0.05 for both), but negative effects on the percentage of total N gases present as N2O (r = -0.976, P < 0.01 and r = -0.781, P < 0.05, respectively). Denitrification rate and the percentage of total gases present as N2O increased as the nitrate (NO3 (-)) concentration increased. However, there was no effect of NO3 (-) concentration on the percentage of total N gases present as NO. Our results indicate that the potential N loss through denitrification may be higher in alkaline paddies than that in neutral and acidic paddies. Moreover, the variation of the N2O percentage in denitrification products of different paddy soils should be considered when estimating the denitrification-derived N2O emission and when calculating the N budget in paddy soils.

Fluxes of NO and N2O from temperate forest soils: impact of forest type, N deposition and of liming on the NO and N2O emissions. Annual cycles of NO, NO2 and N2O emission rates from soil were determined with high temporal resolution at a spruce (control and limed plot) and beech forest site (''Hoglwald'') in Southern Germany (Bavaria) by use of fully automated measuring systems. The fully automated measuring system used for the determination of NO and NO2 flux rates is described in detail. In addition, NO, NO2 and N2O emission rates from soils of different pine forest ecosystems of Northeastern Germany (Brandenburg) were determined during 2 measuring campaigns in 1995. Mean monthly NO and N2O emission rates (July 1994-June 1995) of the untreated spruce plot at the Hoglwald site were in the range of 20-130 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) and 3.5-16.4 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Generally, NO emission exceeded N2O emission. Liming of a spruce plot resulted in a reduction of NO emission rates (monthly means: 15-140 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)) by 25-30% as compared to the control spruce plot. On the other hand, liming of a spruce plot significantly enhanced over the entire observation period N2O emission rates (monthly means: 6.2-22.1 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)). Contrary to the spruce stand, mean monthly N2O emission rates from soil of the beech plot (range: 7.9-102 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) were generally Significantly higher than NO emission rates (range: 6.1-47.0 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)). Results obtained from measuring campaigns in three different pine forest ecosystems revealed mean N2O emission rates between 6.0 and 53.0 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and mean NO emission rates between 2.6 and 31.1 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1). The NO and N2O flux rates reported here for the different measuring sites are high compared to other reported fluxes from temperate forests. Ratios of NO/N2O emission rates were >> 1 for the spruce control and limed plot of the Hoglwald site and << 1 for the beech plot. The pine forest ecosystems showed ratios of NO/N2O emission rates of 0.9 +/- 0.4.

Emission of nitrogen oxides and ammonia from varying rates of applied synthetic urine and correlations with soil chemistry. Synthetic urine was applied at 5 rates, from 0 to 1000 kg synthetic urine-N/ha, to a pasture soil under controlled laboratory conditions. Gaseous emissions of NO(x) and NH(3) were monitored for up to 21 days following application using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry with N(2)O measured using electron-capture gas chromatography. During this period soil replicates were destructively sampled to measure changes in soil pH and inorganic-N concentrations. Comparisons were made between measured soil variables, calculated soil concentrations of NH(3(g)), HNO(2), and the measured gas fluxes. At N rates up to 500 kg N/ha, inorganic-N concentrations increased as nitrification progressed over time. With the exception of the 1000 kg N/ha treatment, NO production followed the pattern of increasing nitrification, reaching a maximum of 905 ng NO-N/cm(2).h in the 500 kg N/ha treatment 14 days after synthetic urine application. At this time the NO flux was associated best with soil pH, NH(4)(+), and NO(2)(-) levels. Over 21 days the maximum cumulative loss as NO-N and N(2)O-N occurred under the 100 kg N/ha urine treatment, with 6.6 and 6.4% of N applied lost as gas, respectively. NO(2) gas fluxes paralleled the NO emissions but were an order of magnitude smaller. Nitrification was inhibited in the 1000 kg N/ha treatment due to the sustained high ammoniacal-N and pH conditions present. These conditions prolonged the NH(3) volatilisation from this treatment. NH(3) volatilisation, as determined by selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry, was linearly related to calculated soil NH(3) gas concentrations up to 500 kg N/ha on Day 1.

N2O AND NO EMISSIONS FROM SOILS OF THE NORTHERN PART OF THE GUAYANA SHIELD, VENEZUELA. Soil fluxes of N2O and NO were measured in a scrub grass savanna and a nearby semideciduous forest in the savanna climatic region of Venezuela, during October 1988. The forest soil produces significantly larger emissions of N2O (ranging from 5.7 to 25.0 X 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1) than the savanna soil (-3.6 to 14.0 X 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1). This suggests that \"long-term\" deforestation could produce a reduction of the N2O emissions to the atmosphere. In comparison with previous results from another site in the Venezuelan savanna region, very low emissions of NO, of the order of 1 to 2 X 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1, were recorded. Considering that the NO/N2O emission ratio was much lower than 1, that practically no changes in the emission were observed after the fertilization with NH4Cl, and that very low concentration of NO3- is found in the natural soil, it is likely that under undisturbed conditions N2O and NO are mainly produced by denitrification and that there is a lack of nitrifying bacteria in these soils. Both N2O and NO emissions increased after application of NaNO3. Since the emission of NO remained larger than the N2O emission (with a ratio of approximately 4/1), a significant change in the production pattern must have occurred after fertilization with nitrate.

CHARACTERIZATION OF NITROGEN-OXIDE FLUXES FROM SOIL OF A FALLOW FIELD IN THE CENTRAL PIEDMONT OF NORTH-CAROLINA. NO(x) emissions from soils may contribute to the formation of O3 in rural areas, especially when there is substantial emissions of natural hydrocarbons from surrounding vegetation, such as in the southeastern United States. Soil NO(x) flux measurements were made from 6 June 1992 to 7 July 1992 in the central Piedmont region of North Carolina (Southeast Oxidants and Nitrogen intensive Analysis site, SONIA) in an effort to determine the role of natural emissions of NO(x) on rural atmospheric photochemistry. The overall average NO and NO2 emission rates, using a dynamic chamber technique, were found to be 1.79 +/- 1.37 ng-N m-2s-1 (range: 0.13 to 6.67 ng-N m-2s-1) and -1.07+/-0.87 ng-N m-2s-1 (range: -6.71 to 3.16 ng-N m-2s-1), respectively. Over 85% of the NO2 flux measurements were negative indicating net deposition to the soil surface. No negative NO flux rates were observed. NO flux was correlated with soil temperature. There was a positive correlation between NO concentration near the soil surface (approximately 50 cm) and NO flux (r = 0.35). The NO compensation point (1.12 ppbv) was estimated from the relationship between NO emission rate and ambient NO concentrations measured at 10 m. Both positive and negative vertical gradients of NO concentration between 10 m and soil surface were detected. The positive vertical gradients are indicative of NO transport to the site from polluted air masses. A significant negative correlation between NO flux and ambient O3 concentration (r=0.66), however, supports the hypothesis that soil emissions of NO contribute to local production Of O3 in rural areas.

We monitored soil emissions of NO, NO(2), N(2)O, and CO(2) throughout the summer dry season at a remote North American sagebrush-steppe ecosystem following application of several resources, including water, NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-) and sucrose. Despite low levels of soil NH(4)(+) (5.60 +/- 0.95 mg NH(4)(+)-N per kg soil, mean +/- S.E.), and NO(3)(-)(-)N (1.34 +/- 0.20 mg NO(3)(-)-N per kg soil), NO emissions ranged from about 0.2 to 2.8 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1), comparable to rates measured from many agricultural, tropical, and other undisturbed ecosystems. Soil wetting increased NO emissions as much as 400-fold when initial gravimetric soil moisture contents were less than about 50 mg kg(soil)(-1) and soil temperature was greater than or equal to 20 degrees C. Wetting treatments with 20 mg NH(4)(+)-N kg(soil)(-1) raised NO emission rates to a level that was nearly an order of magnitude higher than that observed after water addition alone. Wetting treatments with 20 mg NO(3)(-)-N kg(soil)(-1), 240 mg sucrose-C kg(soil)(-1), or NO(3)(-) plus sucrose had no statistically significant effect upon NO emissions. Soil denitrifying enzyme activity was low at this site, and N(2)O emissions in the field were below detection limits. Soil nitrifying enzyme activity was extremely high at this site, indicating that the NH(4)(+) released by ammonification would be consumed at least once every 1.7 days. These observations indicate that NO emissions from this undisturbed ecosystem were likely a consequence of high nitrification activity, and that sagebrush-steppe ecosystems may be a more important NO source than has been previously assumed.

Valuing the Air Quality Effects of Biochar Reductions on Soil NO Emissions. While it is clear that biochar can alter soil N2O emissions, data on NO impacts are scarce. Reports range from O to 67% soil NO emission reductions postbiochar amendment. We use regional air quality and health cost models to assess how these soil NO reductions could influence U.S. air quality and health costs. We find that at 67% soil NO reduction, widespread application of biochar to fertilized agricultural soils could reduce O-3 by up to 2.4 ppb and PM2.5 by up to 0.15 mu g/m(3) in some regions. Modeled biochar-mediated health benefits are up to $4.3 million/county in 2011, with impacts focused in the Midwest and Southwest. These potential air quality and health cobenefits of biochar use highlight the need for an improved understanding of biochar's impacts on soil NO emissions. The benefits reported here should be included with estimates of other biochar benefits, such as crop yield increase, soil water management, and N2O reductions.

Biochar-Compost Additions Have Strong Short-Term Effects on Carbon and Nitrogen Emissions from an Agricultural Soil. Biochar (BC) application to agricultural soils has become a promising strategy for mitigation of soil-borne greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), but little is known about the effects on nitric oxide (NO) and dinitrogen (N-2) fluxes. We conducted a short-term field experiment to evaluate the effects of BC with compost and additional fertilizer on different soil GHG fluxes. Application of 1% BC-compost showed no significant effect on CH4 and CO2 fluxes but lowered NO and N2O fluxes compared to the control without BC-compost. The addition of N to BC-compost (0.5% BC-compost + 175 kg N) showed a small mitigation potential for CH4 whereas N2O and NO fluxes significantly increased for one week after the application. The N-2:N2O ratio shifted towards N2O production after the application of N-enriched BC-compost. During storage of pure N-enriched BC-compost, high gaseous losses in the form of NO (71.2 +/- 2 mu g N g(-1) h(-1)), N2O (1319 +/- 101 mu g N g(-1) h(-1)), and N-2 (337.8 +/- 93 mu g N g(-1) h(-1)) were measured. Approximately 31% of applied N was lost in gaseous form even in the presence of BC. To avoid this, an optimized strategy to balance easily available N from compost and fertilizer with the amount of BC should be developed.

Long-term trends in nitrous oxide emissions, soil nitrogen, and crop yields of till and no-till cropping systems. No-till cropping can increase soil C stocks and aggregation but patterns of long-term changes in N2O emissions, soil N availability, and crop yields still need to be resolved. We measured soil C accumulation, aggregation, soil water, N2O emissions, soil inorganic N, and crop yields in till and no-till corn-soybean-wheat rotations between 1989 and 2002 in southwestern Michigan and investigated whether tillage effects varied over time or by crop. Mean annual NO3 concentrations in no-till were significantly less than in conventional till in three of six corn years and during one year of wheat production. Yields were similar in each system for all 14 years but three, during which yields were higher in no-till, indicating that lower soil NO3 concentrations did not result in lower yields. Carbon accumulated in no-till soils at a rate of 26 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over 12 years at the 0- to 5-cm soil depth. Average nitrous oxide emissions were similar in till (3.27 +/- 0.52 g N ha d(-1)) and no-till (3.63 +/- 0.53 g N ha d(-1)) systems and were sufficient to offset 56 to 61% of the reduction in CO2 equivalents associated with no-till C sequestration. After controlling for rotation and environmental effects by normalizing treatment differences between till and no-till systems we found no significant trends in soil N, N2O emissions, or yields through time. In our sandy loam soils, no-till cropping enhances C storage, aggregation, and associated environmental processes with no significant ecological or yield tradeoffs.

Characterizing nitric oxide emissions from two typical alpine ecosystems. A portion of alpine meadows has been and will continue to be cultivated due to the concurrent increasing demands for animal- and crop-oriented foods and global warming. However, it remains unclear how these long-term changes in land use will affect nitric oxide (NO) emission. At a field site with a calcareous soil on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the authors measured the year-round NO fluxes and related variables in a typically winter-grazed natural alpine meadow (NAM) and its adjacent forage oat field (FOF). The results showed that long-term plow tillage, fertilization and growing forage oats significantly yielded ca. 2.7 times more (p < 0.01) NO emissions from the FOF than the NAM (conservatively 208 vs. 56 g N/(ha.year) on average). The spring freeze-thaw period and non-growing season accounted for 17%-35% of the annual emissions, respectively. The Qio of surface soil temperature (T-s) was 8.9 in the NAM (vs. 3.8 in the FOF), indicating increases of 24%-93% in NO emissions per 1-3 degrees C increase. However, the warming-induced increases could be smaller than those due to land use change and management practices. The T-s and concentrations of ammonium, nitrate and water-extractable organic carbon jointly explained 69% of the variance in daily NO fluxes from both fields during the annual period (p < 0.001). This result indicates that temporally and/or spatially distributed NO fluxes from landscapes with calcareous soils across native alpine meadows and/or fields cultivated with forage oats can be predicted by simultaneous observations of these four soil variables.

Nitrogen oxide emissions from an irrigated maize crop amended with treated pig slurries and composts in a Mediterranean climate. Organic fertilizers may differ greatly in composition and as a result there may also be differences in nitrogen oxides emissions following their application to soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of mineral and organic N fertilizers on the nitrification and denitrification processes, and consequently on N2O and NO emissions. Therefore, a field experiment was carried out on an irrigated sandy loam soil under Mediterranean conditions during the maize (Zea mays L.) growing season. Untreated pig slurry (UPS) both with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (UPS + DCD), digested thin pig slurry fraction (DTP), composted solid fraction of slurry mixed with urea (CPS + U) and composted municipal solid waste mixed with urea (MSW + U) were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N ha(-1). Their emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment to which no nitrogen fertilization was administered (Control). Accumulated nitrous oxide losses during the crop season ranged from 6.0 to 9.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the Control and CPS + U, respectively, whereas nitric oxide losses ranged from 0.01 to 0.23 kg NO-N ha(-1), for the Control and U, respectively. The use of digested slurries mitigated N2O emission by 25% in relation to untreated pig slurry, but NO emissions were similar for both treatments. Dicyandiamide reduced N2O and NO emissions by 64 and 78% with respect to slurry without the inhibitor. An indirect effect of DCD on denitrification was also observed, with a reduction of 32% in denitrification with respect to the slurry without the inhibitor. In this case, the greatest reduction in denitrification losses occurred during the irrigation period. Composts mixed with urea reduced NO emissions by 56% (CPS + U) and 85% (MSW + U) in relation to the urea treatment, but its effect on N2O depended on the type of compost involved: CPS + U increased NO emission by 27%, whereas MSW + U reduced it by 55% in relation to urea. Denitrification was the most important process responsible for N2O emissions when organic fertilizers were applied to the soil, while nitrification was the most important for the inorganic fertilizer. The C:N ratio of fertilizers was a good predictor of their NO emissions, denitrification losses and N2O/N-2 ratio. On the other hand, added soluble N was a good predictor for cumulative N2O emissions during the period before irrigation. This work shows that an appropriate selection of organic fertilizers based on their composition could be used to mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and NO in comparison with urea.

N2O and NO emissions from a field of Chinese cabbage as influenced by band application of urea or controlled-release urea fertilizers. A field experiment was conducted in an Andosol in Tsukuba, Japan to study the effect of banded fertilizer applications or reduced rate of fertilizer N (20% less) on emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), and also crop yields of Chinese cabbage during the growing season in 2000. Six treatments were applied by randomized design with three replications, which were; no N fertilizer (CK); broadcast application of urea (BC); band application of urea (B); band application of urea at a rate 20% lower than B (BL); band application of controlled-release urea (CB) and band application of controlled-release urea at a rate 20% lower than CB (CBL). The results showed that reduced application rates, applied in bands, of both urea (BL) and controlled-release urea fertilizer (CBL) produced yields that were not significantly lower than yields from the full rate of broadcast urea (BC). The emissions of N2O and NO from the reduced fertilizer treatments (BL, CBL) were lower than that of normal fertilizer rates (B, CB). N2O and NO emissions from controlled-release urea applied in band mode (CB, CBL) were less than those from urea applied in band mode (B, BL). The total emissions of N2O and NO indicated that applying fertilizers in band mode mitigated NO emission from soils, but N2O emissions from banded urea (B) were no lower than from broadcast urea (BC).

Influence of soil properties on the turnover of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide by nitrification and denitrification at constant temperature and moisture. Soils are a major source of atmospheric NO and N(2)O. Since the soil properties that regulate the production and consumption of NO and N(2)O are still largely unknown, we studied N trace gas turnover by nitrification and denitrification in 20 soils as a function of various soil variables. Since fertilizer treatment, temperature and moisture are already known to affect N trace gas turnover, we avoided the masking effect of these soil variables by conducting the experiments in non-fertilized soils at constant temperature and moisture. In all soils nitrification was the dominant process of NO production, and in 50% of the soils nitrification was also the dominant process of N(2)O production. Factor analysis extracted three factors which together explained 71% of the variance and identified three different soil groups. Group I contained acidic soils, which showed only low rates of microbial respiration and low contents of total and inorganic nitrogen. Group II mainly contained acidic forest soils, which showed relatively high respiration rates and high contents of total N and NH(4)(+) Group III mainly contained neutral agricultural soils with high potential rates of nitrification. The soils of group I produced the lowest amounts of NO and N(2)O. The results of linear multiple regression conducted separately for each soil group explained between 44-100% of the variance. The soil variables that regulated consumption of NO, total production of NO and N(2)O, and production of NO and N(2)O by either nitrification or denitrification differed among the different soil groups. The soil pH, the contents of NH(4)(+) NO(2)(-) and NO(3)(-), the texture, and the rates of microbial respiration and nitrification were among the important variables.

Long-term measurements of NOx and O3 soil fluxes in a temperate deciduous forest. A long-term campaign devoted to the measurement of fluxes of nitrogen oxides and ozone at the surface of a temperate deciduous forest was carried out from 1st September 2012 to 31st December 2013, using automated dynamic chambers. Soil temperature and water content profiles were recorded near the chambers in order to clarify the short-term response of the fluxes to these two variables. Bulk soil resistances against NO, NO2 and O-3 emission or deposition were also estimated in order to understand their daily and seasonal variations. Nitric oxide was almost exclusively emitted and the annual average soil emission of 27.4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) was higher than those for other deciduous European forests. The maximum daily peaks of NO emission exceeded 100 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) during summertime and were close to zero in wintertime. On annual basis the N balance of the ecosystem as NOx showed a net emission towards the atmosphere of 1.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). This result can be explained by the strong N input through wet deposition observed at this site during the last decades. NO emission fluxes depended exponentially on soil temperature and decreased at high levels of soil water content during summertime, suggesting that the main contribution was due to aerobic nitrification processes. Soil deposition fluxes of NO2 and O-3 were mainly governed by atmospheric processes related to the atmosphere/soil concentration differences. Soil resistances against NO2 and O-3 deposition showed both diurnal and seasonal variations which disagree with the constant values often used in model studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Effect of carbonized apple wood on nitrogen-transforming microorganisms and nitrogen oxides in soil of apple tree rootzone. Biochar amendment is commonly used to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions of agricultural soil. A new type of biochar, carbonized apple wood (CAW), was applied at different rates (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 g kg(-1)) to the soil of 2-year-old apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh. cv. Fuji) grown in pots. The variation in soil abundance of functional genes involved in microbial ammonia oxidation (Anammox and amoA) and denitrification (nirS and nirK) was determined by quantitative PCR, and the nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations in the treated soil were analysed using microelectrodes. The soil's microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus increased significantly with 5 and 10 g kg(-1) CAW application, and addition of 5-40 g kg(-1) CAW altered microbial nitrogen transformation. Furthermore, 5-40 g kg(-1) CAW application at 5-20-cm soil depth reduced NO and N2O concentrations. Redundancy analysis showed close relations between microbial functional genes and soil variables (including microbial biomass carbon, nitric oxide, nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen) after CAW application. These results indicated that microbial nitrogen transformation varied depending on the amount of CAW applied. Application of a moderate amount of CAW (i.e. 10 g kg(-1)) reduced the abundance of functional genes involved in microbial nitrogen transformation, suggesting a potential link with the observed reduction in NO and N2O concentrations in the apple root-zone soil.

Time-lagged induction of N2O emission and its trade-off with NO emission from a nitrogen fertilized Andisol. To understand the influence of basal application of N fertilizer on nitrification potential and N2O and NO emissions, four soil samples were collected from an upland Andisol field just before (sample 1) and 4 (sample 2), 36 (sample 3) and 72 (sample 4) days after the basal application of N fertilizer during the Chinese cabbage growing season from 12 September to 30 November 2005. The potentials of N2O production and nitrification of the soils were determined using a N-15 tracer technique and the soils were incubated for 25 days at 250 degrees C and 60% water-filled pore space (WFPS). The results revealed that as much as 84-97% N2O and almost all NO were produced by nitrification. The 15 N2O emission peak occurred approximately 350 h after the beginning of incubation for samples 1 and 2, but just 48 h later in samples 3 and 4. Total (N2O)-N-15 emission during the 25-day incubation of samples 3 and 4 ranged from 190 to 198 mu g N kg(-1) soil, which was significantly higher than the 99-108 mu g N kg(-1) soil recorded in samples 1 and 2. Basal application of N fertilizer did not immediately increase the nitrification potential and the ratio of N2O to N added, but did dramatically increase the nitrification potential and the ratio of N2O to N added as ((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4 36-72 days after the basal N fertilizer was added. In contrast, NO emission was negatively correlated with nitrification potential and total N2O emission. As a result, a trade-off relationship between total NO and N2O emissions was identified. The results indicated that there was a time-lagged induction of the change of N turnover in the soil, which was possibly caused by slow population growth of the nitrifiers and/or a slow shift in the microbial community in the soil.

Emission of nitrous acid from soil and biological soil crusts represents an important source of HONO in the remote atmosphere in Cyprus. Soil and biological soil crusts can emit nitrous acid (HONO) and nitric oxide (NO). The terrestrial ground surface in arid and semiarid regions is anticipated to play an important role in the local atmospheric HONO budget, deemed to represent one of the unaccounted-for HONO sources frequently observed in field studies. In this study HONO and NO emissions from a representative variety of soil and biological soil crust samples from the Mediterranean island Cyprus were investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. A wide range of fluxes was observed, ranging from 0.6 to 264 ngm(-2) s(-1) HONO-N at optimal soil water content (20-30% of water holding capacity, WHC). Maximum NO-N fluxes at this WHC were lower (0.8-121 ngm(-2) s(-1)). The highest emissions of both reactive nitrogen species were found from bare soil, followed by light and dark cyanobacteria-dominated biological soil crusts (biocrusts), correlating well with the sample nutrient levels (nitrite and nitrate). Extrapolations of lab-based HONO emission studies agree well with the unaccounted-for HONO source derived previously for the extensive CYPHEX field campaign, i.e., emissions from soil and biocrusts may essentially close the Cyprus HONO budget.

Simulated rainfall on agricultural soil reveals enzymatic regulation of short-term nitrous oxide profiles in soil gas and emissions from the surface. Many microbial species use nitrate to support respiration under oxygen limiting conditions via the process of denitrification, which generates the gaseous products nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen (N-2). Denitrifying bacteria reduce NO to N2O, which is a potent greenhouse gas, to maintain intercellular concentrations below cytotoxic levels. The enzymes that reduce N2O to N-2 play a crucial role in restricting N2O emissions from the surface. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that accumulation of N2O results from unbalanced rates of the sequence of denitrification reactions, which is ascribed to enzyme kinetics and sequential gene expression. However, the same enzymatic regulation of N2O accumulation in soil during short periods of anoxia has not been observed in the field. Here, we investigated the role of enzymatic regulation on the accumulation of N2O during a transition from oxic to anoxic conditions that was induced by a simulated rainfall in the field. Distinct regulation regimes for activities of pre- and de novo synthesized denitrification enzymes were observed. The activity of N2O reductase played a crucial role in regulating N2O emissions. Dynamics of N2O mixing ratios in soil gas and emissions from the surface were in excellent agreement with simulations using a one-dimensional, diffusion-reaction equation with explicit representations of denitrification enzyme kinetics. A more explicit representation of the regulatory biology of denitrification in current biogeochemical models, like the approach developed in the subject study, is a promising strategy for improving predictions of episodic emissions of N2O from soil.

Characterisation of NO production and consumption: new insights by an improved laboratory dynamic chamber technique. Biogenic NOx emissions from natural and anthropogenically influenced soils are currently estimated to amount to 9 Tg a(-1), hence a significant fraction of global NOx emissions (45 Tg a(-1)). During the last three decades, a large number of field measurements have been performed to quantify biogenic NO emissions. To study biogenic NO emissions as a function of soil moisture, soil temperature, and soil nutrients, several laboratory approaches have been developed to estimate local/regional NO emissions by suitable upscaling. This study presents an improved and automated laboratory dynamic chamber system (consisting of six individual soil chambers) for investigation and quantification of all quantities necessary to characterise biogenic NO release from soil (i.e. net NO release rate, NO production and consumption rate, and respective Q(10) values). In contrast to former versions of the laboratory dynamic chamber system, the four experiments for complete characterisation can now be performed on a single soil sample, whereas former studies had to be performed on four sub-samples. This study discovered that the sub-sample variability biased former measurements of net NO release rates tremendously. Furthermore, it was also shown that the previously reported variation of optimum soil moisture (i.e. where a maximum net NO release rates occur) between individual sub-samples is most likely a methodical artefact of former versions of the laboratory dynamic chamber system.

A synthesis of nitric oxide emissions across global fertilized croplands from crop-specific emission factors. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer application to agricultural soils results in substantial emissions of nitric oxide (NO), a key substance in tropospheric chemistry involved in climate forcing and air pollution. However, the estimates of global cropland NO emissions remain uncertain due to a lack of information on direct NO emission factors (EF(d)s) of applied N for various cropping systems at seasonal or annual scales. Here we quantified the crop-specific seasonal and annual-scale NO EF(d)s through synthesizing 1094 measurements from 125 field-based studies worldwide. The global mean crop-specific seasonal EFd was 0.53%, with the highest for vegetables (0.75%). Among cereal crops, the EFd of maize (0.45%) or wheat (0.47%) was about three times higher than for rice (0.12%). At annual scale, the mean EFd across all cropping systems was 0.58%, with tea plantations having the highest (1.54%). For other cropping systems, the annual-scale EF(d)s ranged from 0.02% to 1.07%. Besides crop type, also soil organic carbon, total N, and pH as well as N fertilizer type were the main factors explaining the variations of NO EF(d)s. Based on obtained specific EF(d)s for each crop type, we estimated that NO emissions due to the use of synthetic fertilizers from global croplands are about 0.42-0.62 Tg N year(-1). Our budgets are relatively lower if compared to estimates derived by the use of IPCC defaults for NO emissions (0.72-1.66 Tg N year(-1)) or reported elsewhere (0.67-1.04 Tg N year(-1)). In our estimates, cash crops (vegetable, tea and orchard), which cover only 9% of the world cropland area, contributed about 31% to total NO emissions from global fertilized croplands. Overall, our meta-analysis provides improved crop-specific NO EF(d)s reflecting current stage of knowledge. The work also highlights the relative importance of cash crop production as sources for atmospheric NO, that is, agricultural systems on which mitigation efforts may focus.

Reviews and syntheses: Soil N2O and NO emissions from land use and land-use change in the tropics and subtropics: a meta-analysis. Deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics may substantially alter soil N-oxide emissions. It is particularly relevant to accurately quantify those changes to properly account for them in a REDD+ climate change mitigation scheme that provides financial incentives to reduce the emissions. With this study we provide updated land use (LU)-based emission rates (104 studies, 392 N2O and 111 NO case studies), we determine the trend and magnitude of flux changes with land-use change (LUC) using a meta-analysis approach (44 studies, 135 N2O and 37 NO cases) and evaluate biophysical drivers of N2O and NO emissions and emission changes for the tropics. The average N2O and NO emissions in intact upland tropical forest amounted to 2.0 +/- 0.2 (n = 90) and 1.7 +/- 0.5 (n = 36) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In agricultural soils annual N2O emissions were exponentially related to N fertilization rates and average water-filled pore space (WFPS) whereas in non-agricultural sites a Gaussian response to WFPS fit better with the observed NO and N2O emissions. The sum of soil N2O and NO fluxes and the ratio of N2O to NO increased exponentially and significantly with increasing nitrogen availability (expressed as NO3-/[NO3- + NH4+]) and WFPS, respectively; following the conceptual Hole-In-the-Pipe model. Nitrous and nitric oxide fluxes did not increase significantly overall as a result of LUC (Hedges's d of 0.11 +/- 0.11 and 0.16 +/- 0.19, respectively), however individual LUC trajectories or practices did. Nitrous oxide fluxes increased significantly after intact upland forest conversion to croplands (Hedges's d = 0.78 +/- 0.24) and NO increased significantly following the conversion of low forest cover (secondary forest younger than 30 years, woodlands, shrublands) (Hedges's d of 0.44 +/- 0.13). Forest conversion to fertilized systems significantly and highly raised both N2O and NO emission rates (Hedges's d of 1.03 +/- 0.23 and 0.52 +/- 0.09, respectively). Changes in nitrogen availability and WFPS were the main factors explaining changes in N2O emissions following LUC, therefore it is important that experimental designs monitor their spatio-temporal variation. Gaps in the literature on N oxide fluxes included geographical gaps (Africa, Oceania) and LU gaps (degraded forest, wetland (notably peat) forest, oil palm plantation and soy cultivation).

Modeling trace gas emissions from agricultural ecosystems. A computer simulation model was developed for predicting trace gas emissions from agricultural ecosystems. The denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model consists of two components. The first component, consisting of the soil climate, crop growth, and decomposition submodels, predicts soil temperature, moisture, pH, Eh, and substrate concentration profiles based on ecological drivers (e.g., climate, soil, vegetation, and anthropogenic activity). The second component, consisting of the nitrification, denitrification, and fermentation submodels, predicts NH3, NO, N2O, and CH4 fluxes based on the soil environmental variables. Classical laws of physics, chemistry, or biology or empirical equations generated from laboratory observations were used in the model to parameterize each specific reaction. The entire model links trace gas emissions to basic ecological drivers. Through validation against data sets of NO, N2O, CH4, and NH3 emissions measured at four agricultural sites, the model showed its ability to capture patterns and magnitudes of trace gas emissions.

How Stand Age Affects Soil Nitrification and Nitrogen Gas Emissions in Tropical and Subtropical Tea Plantations. Tea plants prefer NH4+-N to NO3--N, and thus nitrification would be detrimental to the N uptake of tea. However, the effects of different stand ages on nitrification and nitrogen oxide (NO and N2O) emissions in tropical and subtropical regions remain unclear. We performed an incubation experiment with tea field soils from different stand ages (5, 15, and 30 years) under different water contents in subtropical (Changsha, Hunan; C5L, C15L, C30L, C5H, C15H, C30H) and tropical regions (Baisha, Hainan; B5L, B15L, B30L, B5H, B15H, B30H). The results showed that the highest net nitrification rate was in C15L and B15. The results indicated that there was more NO3--N loss in the 15-y tea field soil in both regions. The highest nitrogen oxide emissions from the subtropical and tropical plots were in C15H and B30H. Available K was the key variable for NO and N2O emissions in Changsha county, whereas SOM, pH, and available P were the key factors affecting NO and N2O emissions in Baisha county. Our findings suggest that more attention should be paid to NO3--N loss in middle-aged (10-30 years) tea fields. Similarly, the focus should be given to nitrogen oxide emissions from middle-aged tea plantations in subtropical regions and old tea plantations (>= 30 stand years) in tropical regions.

Model simulation of changes in N2O and NO emissions with conversion of tropical rain forests to pastures in the Costa Rican Atlantic Zone. Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and nitric oxide (NO) are among the trace gases of concern because of their importance in global climate and atmospheric chemistry. Modeling techniques are needed for simulating the spatial and temporal dynamics of N(2)O and NO emissions from soils into the atmosphere. In this study, we modified the ecosystem model CENTURY to simulate changes in N(2)O and NO soil emissions through the process of converting tropical moist forests to pastures in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Rica. Measurements of water-filled pore space (WFPS) and fluxes of N(2)O and NO from a chronosequence of pastures were used for calibration and testing of the model. It was found that the N(2)O + NO - WFPS and N(2)O:NO - WFPS relationships as developed from primary forests could be generalized to the chronosequence of pastures and other land use systems in the region. Modeled net increases (compared to primary forests) in total N(2)O and NO production after conversion from forest to pasture were 514 kg N ha(-1) during the first 15 years under normal field conditions. The nitrogen loss in the form of N(2)O and NO during the first 15 years could range from 401 to 548 kg N ha(-1), depending on the amounts of forest residue remaining on pasture sites. N(2)O-N accounted for 90% of the gas fluxes, while NO-N accounted for 10%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the impacts of forest-pasture conversion on N(2)O and NO emissions from soil into the atmosphere were complex, depending on the initial conditions of the forest-derived pastures, management practices, soil physical and chemical conditions and their changes over time, N availability, and climate. It is therefore important to incorporate the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of those controlling factors in estimating regional and global N(2)O and NO emissions from soils into the atmosphere.

Aged biochar stimulated ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria-derived N2O and NO production in an acidic vegetable soil. Both nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions are typically high in greenhouse-based high N input vegetable soils. Biochar amendment has been widely recommended for mitigating soil N2O emissions in agriculture. However, knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of fresh and aged biochar for both N2O and NO production during ammonia oxidation is lacking. Two vegetable soils with different pH values were used in aerobic incubation experiments with 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), 1-octyne and acetylene. The relative importance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) to N2O and NO production was investigated as influenced by fresh and aged biochar amendments. The results showed that AOA dominated N2O production in acidic soil, while AOB dominated N2O production in alkaline soil. Aged biochar stimulated both AOA- and AOB-derived N2O and NO production by 84.8 and 340%, respectively, in acidic soil but only increased AOA-derived N2O and NO production in alkaline soil. Fresh biochar amendment increased AOA- and AOB-derived NO in acidic soil and AOA-derived NO in alkaline soil but had negligible effects on AOA- and AOB-derived N2O in both soils. Fresh biochar decreased AOA-amoA but increased AOB-amoA gene abundances in acidic soil, whereas aged biochar increased AOA- and AOB-amoA gene abundances in both soils. These findings improved our understanding of N2O and NO production mechanisms under different biochar amendments in alkaline and acidic vegetable soils. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Future scenarios of N2O and NO emissions from European forest soils. In this study we investigated possible feedbacks of predicted future climate change on forest soil NO and N2O emissions in Europe. For this we used two climate scenarios, one representing a 10-year period of present-day climate (1991-2000) and a 9-year period for future climate conditions (2031-2039). The climate scenarios were used to drive the GIS-coupled biogeochemical model Photosynthesis-Evapotranspiration-Model Denitrification-Decomposition-Model (PnET-N-DNDC), which has currently been tested for its predicting capability for soil N trace gas emissions for various sites across Europe. The model results show a complex, spatially differentiated pattern of changes in future N2O and NO emissions from the forest soils across Europe, which were driven by the combined effect of changes in precipitation and temperature. Overall, the model predicted that N2O emissions from the European forest soils will on average decrease by 6%. This decrease was mainly due to the shift in N2O:N-2 ratio driven by enhanced denitrification. NO emissions were found to increase by 9%. The increases in NO emissions were mainly due to increases in temperature. Only for the regions where soil moisture was predicted to markedly increase or suffer from water stress during the vegetation period, a reduction of NO emissions was simulated. The simulations show the possibility and feasibility for assessing climate change feedbacks on biogenic N trace gas emissions from soils at a regional scale.

Impacts of urea deep placement on nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from rice fields in Bangladesh. Urea deep placement (UDP) increases nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in lowland rice fields by reducing ammonia volatilization, surface runoff and increasing nitrogen uptake. However, its effects on N losses as nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are not yet clear. We conducted field experiments at two locations of Bangladesh Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) and Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) - to determine the effects of UDP vs broadcast urea on N2O and NO emissions from rice fields. N2O and NO emissions were measured from three N fertilizer treatments (control [0 kg N/ha], UDP, broadcast urea) using automated gas sampling and analysis system continuously for three rice growing seasons Aus (May-Aug), Amen (Aug-Dec) and Bore (Jan-May). Urea was applied as 2-3 split application, while for UDP treatment, urea briquettes were deep placed (7-10 cm depth) between 4 hills of rice at alternate rows to meet recommended N rates in a single application. Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications and N2O and NO measurements were done at every three-hour interval. N2O emissions were sporadic and event specific. Peaks in N2O emissions were observed after broadcast application of urea, during dry period and after re-flooding of the dry soil. For the rest of the time during the rice-growing season, emissions were very low to negligible. However, across the rice-growing seasons, UDP significantly (P < 0.05) reduced N2O emissions compared with broadcast urea. Moreover, N2O emissions showed significant spatial and seasonal variations. They were higher during Boro season compared with Aus and Aman seasons and at BAU site than that of BRRI. Conversely, emissions between Aus and Aman seasons and between control and UDP treatments were similar. In contrast to N2O emissions, NO emissions were negligible and not affected by fertilizer treatment. However, significant spatial and seasonal variations were observed, with higher NO emissions at BRRI site compared with BAU and during Boro than that of Aus season. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Manganese oxide affects nitrification and N2O emissions in a subtropical paddy soil with variable water regimes. Crop management-induced redox cycles lead to the formation of distinct soil layers that characterize manganese (Mn) distribution or redistribution in rice (Oryza sativaL.) based ecosystems. We studied the effect of Mn oxides on soil nitrification and N2O emissions to validate the hypothesis that Mn oxides affect the soil's nitrification and denitrification processes. Subtropical paddy soil with three different water regimes (50, 100 and 200% of soil water-holding capacity (WHC)) was treated with 3% birnessite (Mn oxide) or left untreated. The nitrification process was simulated with zero- or first-order kinetic models and N2O emissions were also measured. The maximum net rates of soil nitrification (V-a1) decreased significantly with increasing soil moisture contents (F = 184.8; P < 0.001), and so did the average net rates of soil nitrification (V-a2) (F = 6.96; P = 0.008). Manganese oxide significantly decreased V-a1 (F = 474.7; P < 0.001), whereas it had no significant effects on V-a2 (F = 0.26; P = 0.62). Manganese oxide changed the best fitting nitrification kinetic model from first- to zero-order for both 50 and 200% WHC, but it had no effect at 100% WHC. The maximum rates of emission of N2O significantly increased with increasing soil water contents (F = 15 007; P < 0.001). Manganese oxide retarded the maximum rate of N2O emission at 100% WHC, whereas it depressed the rate from 1084 to 225 g N kg(-1) day(-1) at 200% WHC (F = 7494; P < 0.001). The results indicate that the effects of Mn oxide on regulating nitrification and N2O emissions are associated with water regime-dictated redox potential, and might have important implications for regulating N cycling in rice-based ecosystems. Highlights Effect of manganese oxide on nitrification and denitrification in a paddy soil. Mn oxide retarded nitrification in oxic conditions and enhanced it in anoxic conditions.

Spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen oxide and methane fluxes from a fertilized tree plantation in Costa Rica. Nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) are naturally produced and consumed by soil biogeochemical processes. Naturally high variation between trace gas fluxes may temporarily increase due to agricultural management. We studied spatial and temporal variability of fluxes in the context of a 3-year field experiment established to identify and quantify N2O fluxes and controlling factors using automated field measurements. We measured trace gas fluxes, soil temperature, and moisture from fertilized and unfertilized balsa (Ochroma lagopus) plantations. Combining spatial and temporal sampling we evaluate if automatically measured time series of N2O emissions are representative of overall mean fluxes from fertilized loam under balsa. Soil trace gas fluxes were measured manually at 36 randomly distributed sampling locations per plot. Mean plot emissions were evaluated against fluxes measured by seven chambers commonly used for routine bimonthly manual measurements and against N2O emissions measured by two automated chambers at 4.6-hour sampling intervals. Trace gas fluxes were highly variable over 40 x 40 m plots. Nitrogen oxide fluxes were mainly spatially independent. Fertilization increased nitrogen oxide emissions but did not introduce spatial dependency of flux data. Within about 6 weeks fluxes approached pre-fertilization level again. Given high spatial variation of nitrogen oxide fluxes we find that automatically measured N2O fluxes represent the nature of the flux response well and are in the range of fluxes indicated by spatial sampling. When soils were relatively dry fertilization inhibited CH4 uptake. C1 Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA.

Natural emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds; carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen from North America. The magnitudes, distributions, controlling processes and uncertainties associated with North American natural emissions of oxidant precursors are reviewed. Natural emissions are responsible for a major portion of the compounds, including non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO), that determine tropospheric oxidant concentrations. Natural sources include soil microbes, vegetation, biomass burning, and lightning. These sources are strongly influenced by human activities that have led to significant changes in the magnitude and distribution of natural emissions in the past two centuries. The total NMVOC flux of about 84 x 10(12) g of carbon (Tg C) is comprised primarily of isoprene (35%), 19 other terpenoid compounds (25%) and 17 non-terpenoid compounds (40%). Vegetation is predicted to contribute about 98% of the total annual natural NMVOC emission. The estimated annual natural NO emission of 2.1 x 10(12) g of nitrogen (Tg N) from North America is primarily due to soils and lightning, while the estimated 10 Tg C of CO arises from biomass burning and vegetation. Field measurements of ambient concentrations and above canopy fluxes have validated emission estimates for a few compounds from some important landscapes. The uncertainty associated with natural emission estimates ranges from less than 50% for midday summer isoprene emission from some locations to about a factor of 10 for some compounds and landscapes.

Nitrification and denitrification as sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide - role of oxidizable carbon and applied nitrogen. Laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to study the influence of easily oxidizable C (glucose) and mineral N (NH4+ and NO3-) on NO emission, evolution of Co-2 and consumption of O-2. A flush of N2O was always observed during the first few hours after the start of soil incubation, which was significantly higher with NH4+ compared to NO3- applications. The increase in N2O emission was attributed mainly to enhanced soil respiration and subsequent O-2 limitation at the microsite level. Application of NH4+ helped to develop denitrifying populations since subsequent additions of NO3- and a C source significantly enhanced N2O emissions. In soils treated with NH4+, N2O emissions declined rapidly, which was related to decreasing concentrations of easily oxidizable C. Addition of glucose in different amounts and pre-incubation of soil for different lengths of time (to create variation in the amount of easily oxidizable C) changed the pattern of N2O emissions, which was ascribed to changes in soil respiration.

Effect of different biochar and fertilizer types on N2O and NO emissions. The use of biochar as soil improver and climate change mitigation strategy has gained much attention, although at present the effects of biochar on soil properties and greenhouse gas emissions are not completely understood. The objective of our incubation study was to investigate biochar's effect on N2O and NO emissions from an agricultural Luvisol upon fertilizer (urea, NH4Cl or KNO3) application. Seven biochar types were used, which were produced from four different feedstocks pyrolyzed at various temperatures. At the end of the experiment, after 14 days of incubation, soil nitrate concentrations were decreased upon biochar addition in all fertilizer treatments by 6-16%. Biochar application decreased both cumulative N2O (52-84%) and NO (47-67%) emissions compared to a corresponding treatment without biochar after urea and nitrate fertilizer application, and only NO emissions after ammonium application. N2O emissions were more decreased at high compared to low pyrolysis temperature. Several hypotheses for our observations exist, which were assessed against current literature and discussed thoroughly. In our study, the decreased N2O and NO emissions are expected to be mediated by multiple interacting phenomena such as stimulated NH3 volatilization, microbial N immobilization, non-electrostatic sorption of NH4+ and NO3-, and biochar pH effects.

Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from lowland rice cultivation with urea deep placement and alternate wetting and drying irrigation. Urea deep placement (UDP) and the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation method are two promising rice production technologies. However, studies on the impact of UDP under AWD irrigation on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions are limited. In this study, the effects of UDP with AWD irrigation on these emissions, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and rice yields are investigated, compared to conventional broadcast application. N2O and NO emissions from three fertilizer treatments - no nitrogen, UDP, and broadcast application of prilled urea (PU) - were measured. Measurements were taken using an automated gas sampling and analysis system continuously for two consecutive Boro (dry) rice seasons. N2O emission peaks were observed after broadcast application of PU but not after UDP. In contrast, large spikes in N2O emission were observed after UDP, compared to broadcast application, during dry periods. Despite differences in emission peaks, seasonal cumulative N2O emissions from UDP and broadcast treatments were similar. However, NO emissions were minimal and unaffected by UDP or AWD. UDP increased rice yields by 28% and N recovery efficiency by 167%, compared to broadcast urea. This study demonstrates that UDP with AWD irrigation can increase yields and NUE without increasing N2O and NO emissions. C1 [Islam, S. M. Mofijul; Biswas, Jatish Chandra; Ahmed, Md.

Variation of nitric oxide emission potential in plants: a possible link to leaf N content and net photosynthetic activity. Aims Ecological systems, especially soils, have been recently recognized as an important source of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO). However, the study on the contribution of plants to atmospheric NO budget is significantly lagged. The specific objectives of this study are to reveal the phylogenetic variation in NO emission potential existing in various plant species and find out the possible leaf traits affecting NO emission potential. Methods We measured NO emission potential, leaf N and C content, C: N ratio, specific leaf area, net photosynthetic rate (P-n) and estimated photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE) of 88 plant species. Further investigation of the relationships between NO emission potential and leaf traits were performed by simple linear regression analysis and pair-wise correlation coefficients analysis. Important Findings Major results are as follows: (1) NO emission from plant species exhibited large variations, ranging from 0 to 41.7 nmol m(-2) h(-1), and the species frequency distributions of NO emission potential could be fitted to a log-normal curve. (2) Among 88 species, NO emission potential was the highest in Podocarpus macrophyllus, but lowest in Zanthoxylum nitidum and Vernicia montana. (3) NO emission potential has strong correlation to leaf N content, P-n and PNUE. The variations in NO emission potential among diverse plant species may be closely related to leaf N level and net photosynthetic ability.

Effect of dicyandiamide and polymer coated urea applications on N2O, NO and CH4 fluxes from Andosol and Fluvisol fields. Soil type influences the effectiveness of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers in reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, although the effect has not been well studied. We measured N2O, NO and methane (CH4) fluxes after the application of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers and conventional fertilizer (urea) in two contrasting soils, an Andosol and a Fluvisol, in lysimeter fields. Brassica rapa var. perviridis L.H.Bailey (komatsuna) was cultivated for 1.5months in spring and in autumn. A nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), and polymer coated urea (CU) were tested in the spring and autumn experiments, respectively. In spring, DCD was effective in reducing N2O and NO emissions in the Andosol but not in the Fluvisol, compared with urea. Nitrification was likely to be a more important production process for N2O and NO in the Andosol than in the Fluvisol. This difference in N2O and NO production processes was inferred to be the main reason why DCD effectively reduced N2O and NO emissions only in the Andosol. Yield-scaled N2O emission for DCD was lower by 63% than for urea in the Andosol, but no difference was observed in the Fluvisol. In autumn in the Andosol, CU increased N2O emission compared with urea, but no difference was observed for NO emissions. In the Fluvisol, CU was not effective in reducing N2O and NO emissions. CH4 uptake from the Andosol was significantly higher than that from the Fluvisol. Fertilizer type had no effect on cumulative CH4 uptake in either soil. Our results showed that the effectiveness of DCD and CU in reducing N2O and NO emissions varied with soil because the main production processes of these gases varied with soil.

Urea and soil use had no effect on CO2 production. Nitrons oxide emission from soil was three times higher in the dry than in the rainy season, while urea fertilization doubled emissions. Emissions were twice as high from soil sampled under A. angustissima canopy than from arable land, but 1.2 lower than from soil sampled outside the canopy, and five times higher from soil incubated at 40 % of the water-holding capacity (WHC) than at soil moisture content, but 15 times lower than from soil incubated at 100 WHC. It was found that the soil sampling time and water content had a significant effect on N2O emissions, while N fertilizer and sampling location were less influent.

Two-year simultaneous records of N2O and NO fluxes from a farmed cropland in the northern China plain with a reduced nitrogen addition rate by one-third. Given the common problem of fertilizer overuse, agronomists are calling for a reduction of the high nitrogen dose by 1/3. We carried out a field experiment over two full winter wheat-summer maize rotations in the North China Plain (NCP) to determine whether this degree of nitrogen reduction will significantly reduce the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Three treatments were investigated in the field trial: a control with no nitrogen application, the conventional practice with nitrogen over-application and the optimal practice with a reduced dose of nitrogen by 1/3. Our observations across all treatments over the experimental period reveal significant correlations of the fluxes of either gas with soil temperature and moisture as well as the concentrations of soil ammonium, nitrate and dissolvable organic carbon. There were strong correlations within the functions of the dual Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving apparent activation energy values of 40-97 and 59-92 kJ mol(-1) for N2O and NO fluxes, respectively. Our results provide annual direct emission factors of 0.48-0.96% for N2O and 0.15-0.47% for NO and demonstrate a significant correlation between N2O emission induced by fertilization and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The correlation indicates a significant potential of N2O mitigation via enhancing NUEs. A reduction in the nitrogen dose did not obviously mitigate either the annual NO emission in both rotations or the annual N2O emission in the second one. However, nitrogen reduction significantly decreased the annual total N2O emission by 38% during the first rotation. These inconsistencies in the responses of N2O emission to the reduced nitrogen dose can be attributed to improper fertilization practices, such as broadcasting urea prior to heavy rainfalls or irrigation events during the maize season, which implies a need for further fertilization practice options/techniques in addition to the reduction of nitrogen doses.

We evaluated the effects of different grazers and plant species composition on N2O and NO emissions in temperate grassland. Paddocks were grazed rotationally by either cattle or sheep. Mean N2O emissions were 38.7 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), mean NO emissions 2.4 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1). Cumulative NO-N emissions were larger for sheep-than for cattle-grazed paddocks. Plant species composition was insignificant compared to the effect of grazers on N oxide emissions. In a controlled application experiment, plots with cattle excreta showed larger N2O emissions than plots with sheep excreta, reaching peak emissions of 1921 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) on cattle urine patches compared to 556 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) on sheep urine patches, related to different N-inputs per excretion. Peak emissions of dung-treated plots were much smaller. The N2O emission factors were 0.4% for cattle urine, 0.5% for sheep urine, 0.05% for cattle dung and 0.09% for sheep dung. N oxide emissions on the paddock scale were larger for sheep-compared to cattle-grazing, despite larger emissions per cattle excretion.

Soil emissions of NO and N2O from typical land uses across Lowland and Highland Scotland were simulated under climate change conditions, during a short-term laboratory study. All locations investigated were significant sources of N2O (range: 157-277 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) and low-to-moderate sources of NO emissions (range: 0.4-30.5 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)), with a general tendency to decrease with altitude and increase with fertiliser and atmospheric N inputs. Simulated climate warming and extreme events (drought, intensive rainfall) increased soil NO pulses and N2O emissions from both natural and managed ecosystems in the following order: natural Highlands < natural Lowlands < grazed grasslands < natural moorland receiving high NH3 deposition rates. Largest NO emission rates were observed from natural moorlands exposed to high NH3 deposition rates. Although soil NO emissions were much smaller (6-660 times) than those of N2O, their impact on air quality is likely to increase as combustion sources of NO (x) are declining as a result of successful mitigation. This study provides evidence of high N emission rates from natural ecosystems and calls for urgent action to improve existing national and intergovernmental inventories for NO and N2O, which at present do not fully account for emissions from natural soils receiving no direct anthropogenic N inputs.

Nitrogen oxide and methane emissions under varying tillage and fertilizer management. Comprehensive assessment of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) budget of reduced tillage agricultural systems must consider emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CM), each of which have higher global warming potentials than carbon dioxide (CO2). Tillage intensity may also impact nitric oxide (NO) emissions, which can have various environmental and agronomic impacts. In 2003 and 2004, we used chambers to measure N2O, CM, and NO fluxes from plots that had been managed under differing tillage intensity since 1991. The effect of tillage on non-CO2 GHG emissions varied, in both magnitude and direction, depending on fertilizer practices. Emissions of N2O following broadcast urea (BU) application were higher under no till (NT) and conservation tillage (CsT) compared to conventional tillage (CT). In contrast, following anhydrous ammonia (AA) injection, N2O emissions were higher under CT and CsT compared to NT. Emissions following surface urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) application did not vary with tillage. Total growing season non-CO2 GHG emissions were equivalent to CO2 emissions of 0.15 to 1-9 Mg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) or 0.04 to 0.53 Mg soil-C ha(-1) yr-1. Emissions of N2O from AA-amended plots were two to four times greater than UAN- and BU-amended plots. Total NO + N2O losses in the UAN treatment were approximately 50% lower than AA and BU. This study demonstrates that N20 emissions can represent a substantial component of the total GHG budget of reduced tillage systems, and that interactions between fertilizer and tillage practices can be important in controlling non-CO2 GHG emissions.

Water-conscious management strategies reduce per-yield irrigation and soil emissions of CO2, N2O, and NO in high-temperature forage cropping systems. Agricultural soils are important sources of greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as nitric oxide (NO), a precursor to tropospheric ozone. Management approaches that constrain these emissions can limit future warming and improve regional air quality, especially in high-temperature agroecosystems where soil emissions are high. Subsurface drip irrigation is a promising management solution that can limit emissions via targeted rhizosphere access to water and nitrogenous fertilizers. In complementary field studies in southern California, we compared per-yield irrigation and soil emissions in surface-and drip-irrigated field plots growing alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor ssp. Sudanese), two forage crops with differing fertilizer requirements. For each study, we monitored soil temperature, moisture, and emission responses to irrigation in both spring and summer using a custom automated chamber array that recorded measurements every 30 minutes. We found that, compared to furrow irrigation, drip irrigation in sudangrass increased hay yield by 6% and per-yield soil CO2 emissions by 9% while it decreased irrigation demand by 49%, N2O emissions by 59%, and NO by 49%. In alfalfa, drip irrigation increased yield by 7% while decreasing irrigation by 1%, per-yield soil CO2 emissions by 59%, N2O by 38%, and NO by 20%. In both crops, differences between irrigation types were strongest in summer months, when high temperatures produced large pulses of N2O and NO in sudangrass and CO2 in alfalfa following flood irrigation relative to small pulses following drip irrigation. As agriculture intensifies in warmer climates, implementation of subsurface drip irrigation can help reduce the emission of soil emissions that affect Earth's climate and regional air quality.

Annual NO and N2O emissions under different fertilisation regimes from a greenhouse vegetable cropping system in subtropical China. Context Overuse of N fertiliser in vegetable cropping systems is known to release of nitric and nitrous oxide to the atmosphere in China. Optimisation of N fertilisation regimes has the potential to mitigate NO and N2O emissions from these N-rich systems. Aims We investigated the effects of different N fertilisation regimes on NO and N2O emissions, and vegetable yields, with particular efforts to estimate annual direct emission factors of NO and N2O under different N fertilisation regimes in greenhouse vegetable fields. Methods Annual NO and N2O fluxes were taken simultaneously using the static chamber-based method from a greenhouse vegetable system in south-east China with four N fertiliser treatments: (1) no N fertiliser (control); (2) chemical N fertiliser application (CF); (3) organic N fertiliser application (OF); and (4) organic-chemical mixed N fertiliser application (MF). Key results N fertilisers significantly increased NO and N2O emissions. Direct emission factors of N fertiliser for NO and N2O were the largest for MF, with an average of 0.99% and 0.67%, respectively. Vegetable yields were only significantly enhanced under OF treatment. Conclusions Relative to the use of chemical N fertiliser, the application of organic-chemical mixed N fertiliser showed not to be effective for mitigating NO and N2O emissions. Instead, sole application of organic N fertiliser was a viable option to enhance vegetable yields but without increasing NO and N2O emissions in greenhouse vegetable systems. Implications Substituting the use of chemical N fertiliser with organic N fertiliser input could benefitvegetable production but without stimulating NO and N2O emissions from vegetable cropping systems in sub-tropical China.

NO gas loss from biologically crusted soils in Canyonlands National Park, Utah. In this study, we examined N gas loss as nitric oxide (NO) from N-fixing biologically crusted soils in Canyonlands National Park, Utah. We hypothesized that NO gas loss would increase with increasing N fixation potential of the biologically crusted soil. NO fluxes were measured from biologically crusted soils with three levels of N fixation potential (Scytonema-Nostoc-Collema spp. (dark) > Scytonema-Nostoc-Microcoleus spp. ( medium)> Microcoleus spp. ( light)) from soil cores and field chambers. In both cores and field chambers there was a significant effect of crust type on NO fluxes, but this was highly dependent on season. NO fluxes from field chambers increased with increasing N fixation potential of the biologically crusted soils ( dark > medium > light) in the summer months, with no differences in the spring and autumn. Soil chlorophyll a content ( an index of N fixation potential), percent N, and temperature explained 40% of the variability in NO fluxes from our field sites. Estimates of annual NO loss from dark and light crusts was 0.04 - 0.16 and 0.02 - 0.11 kg NO-N/ha/year. Overall, NO gas loss accounts for approximately 3 - 7% of the N inputs via N fixation in dark and light biologically crusted soils. Land use practices have drastically altered biological soil crusts communities over the past century. Livestock grazing and intensive recreational use of public lands has resulted in a large scale conversion of dark cyanolichen crusts to light cyanobacterial crusts. As a result, changes in biologically crusted soils in arid and semi-arid regions of the western US may subsequently impact regional NO loss.

Influence of drip and furrow irrigation systems on nitrogen oxide emissions from a horticultural crop. irrigation management has an important influence on emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) from irrigated agricultural soils. In order to develop strategies to reduce the emission of these gases, a field experiment was carried out to compare the influence of different irrigation systems: furrow (FI) and drip-irrigation (DI), on N2O and NO emissions from a soil during the melon crop season. Two fertilizer treatments were evaluated for each irrigation regime: ammonium sulphate (AS) as a mineral N fertilizer, at a rate of 175 kg N ha(-1); and a control without any N fertilizer (Control). On plots where the AS treatment was applied, drip irrigation reduced total N2O and NO emissions (by 70% and 33% respectively) with respect to values for furrow irrigation. This was probably due to the lower amount of water applied and the different soil wetting pattern associated with DI. Dry areas of the drip-irrigated plots emitted a similar amount of N2O to the wet areas (0.45 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) in the Control and greater quantities in the AS treatment (0.92 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for dry and 0.70 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for wet areas). We suggest that the N oxide pulses observed throughout the irrigation period on DI plots could have been the result of frequent increases in the soil wetting volume after the addition of water. Denitrification losses (from depths of 0-10 cm) were estimated at 11.44 kg N2O- N ha(-1) for the AS treatment under FI and at 4.96 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for DI. Under DI, nitrification was an important source of N2O, whereas denitrification was the most important source under FI. The addition of NH and the use of DI enhanced the N2O/N-2 ratio of gases produced through denitrification. The quantity of dissolved organic C (DOC) in the soil generally decreased with addition of NH4+. This work showed that, in comparison with furrow irrigation, drip irrigation is a method that can be used to save water and mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and N2O.

THE PRODUCTION OF ATMOSPHERIC NOX AND N2O FROM A FERTILIZED AGRICULTURAL SOIL. The source strength of atmospheric trace gases from rural or remote locations must be quantified in order to assess the effect of such inputs on the background tropospheric chemistry. To assess the importance of biological production of NO(x) and N2O from fertilized agricultural soil, enclosure techniques have been used to determine the emission fluxes of NO(x) and N2O at a site in Southern Ontario, Canada. NO(x) fluxes on the unfertilized soil range from 1.5 to 41.6-mu-g(NO) m-2 h-1. The corresponding N2O fluxes are 0-61.8-mu-g(N2O) m-2 h-1. For the most highly fertilized soil NO(x) fluxes range from 3.1 to 583-mu-g(NO) m-2 h-1 and the N2O fluxes from 0 to 446-mu-g(N2O) m-2 h-1. The fluxes increase linearly with fertilizer application, with 11% of the nitrogen in the fertilizer converted to NO(x) and 5% to N2O. The emission rates were studied as functions of the soil parameters temperature, moisture, ammonium, nitrate and pH, to attempt to understand better the production mechanisms, although a model for the process could not be developed. In rural areas away from transportation corridors the increased NO(x) emission from fertilized soil may dominate local oxidant production but is not significant on the Province-wide scale.

Does nitrate fertilization induce nox emission from scots pine (p. sylvestris) shoots?. The possibility of NOx (NO + NO2) emissions from plants and the underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. Excess NO created possibly as a result of nitrite accumulation in plant leaves has been suggested to result in emissions. Such emission has been observed in laboratory conditions due to nitrate fertilization. In this study, we tested whether nitrate fertilization of Scots pine seedlings growing outdoors leads to accumulation of NO3- or NO2- in the needles and subsequent NOx emission. The experiment was done at the SMEAR II station in Southern Finland. The seedlings received nitrate or ammonium fertilizer or neither. Shoot NOx emissions were measured with dynamic chambers. Total dissolved nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, NO3-, NO2- and NH4+ concentrations in the soil and needles were determined. NOx fluxes from the shoots were, on average, deposition. There was no indication of fertilization-induced NO or NOx emissions. The highest NO fluxes were observed at night and were humidity-related. It seems unlikely that additional nitrate in the soil could cause significant NOx emission from boreal Scots pine forests in field conditions, possibly because of soil chemistry.

No-tillage did not increase organic carbon storage but stimulated N2O emissions in an intensively cultivated sandy loam soil: A negative climate effect. Although numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of no-tillage on carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural systems, there is still no consensus on the balance between the potential of C sequestration and nitrous oxide (N2O) or nitric oxide (NO) emissions. A no-tillage field experiment in the North China Plain was established in 2006 and the influence of no-tillage on N2O and NO emissions was monitored under an annual wheat-maize cropping system. The study included four treatments: no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) soils amended with N fertilizer at a rate of 225 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and 195 kg N ha(-1) for maize (NTN and CTN) and without N fertilizer (NT0 and CT0). Three years of no-tillage significantly (p < 0.05) increased soil organic C (SOC) content by 12.2% in the 0-5 cm soil layer, possibly due to the surface aggregation of organic C derived from crop roots and exudates, but did not alter SOC pool in the 0-30 an profile. Annual N2O emissions in the NT0 and CT0 treatments were 0.53 and 0.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively, and were significantly (p < 0.05) increased to 0.96 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in CTN and to 1.23 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in NTN. Remarkable differences in N20 emissions between CTN and NTN were observed during the maize growing season. In contrast, NO emissions were not affected by the tillage regimes regardless of N fertilization. The mean ratios of NO/N2O fluxes in N-unfertilized plots were 0.26-0.29 and 1.79-2.11 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, indicating that both NO and N2O were primarily derived from denitrification during the maize growing season and from nitrification under wheat cultivation. Under N-fertilized plots, the ratios increased to 1.44-2.02 and 5.00-6.03 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, with significantly (p < 0.05) lower values in NTN plots than in CTN plots. The N2O emission factors for N applied in the wheat-maize rotation system were 0.16% and 0.09% for NTN and CTN, respectively, which was far lower than the IPCC Tier 1 default value (1.0%), primarily due to the absence of irrigation after fertilization in maize season and low temperature in wheat season. The results suggest that the 3-year no-tillage regime with residue removal did not substantially increase C storage in the 0-30 cm profile, but stimulated N2O emissions primarily by increasing denitrification.

Fertilizer-induced N2O and NO emissions in tea gardens and the main controlling factors: A recent three-decade data synthesis. Tea gardens have been widely documented to be hotspots for nitrogen (N) oxide emissions (i.e., nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO)). However, a quantitative understanding of N oxide emissions related to different fertilizer regimes and the main controlling factors is lacking. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of 56 peer-reviewed publications on N oxide emissions from global tea gardens over the past three decades. Overall, fertilization increased N2O and NO emissions (p < 0.001) by 584 % and 790 %, respectively. The stimulating effect of fertilizer on N2O and NO emissions was mainly related to high N application rates. Furthermore, organic fertilizer treatment, combined fertilizer treatment, biochar amendment, and inhibitor amendment reduced N2O emissions (p < 0.05) by 63 %, 64 %, 69 %, and 94 %, respectively, relative to chemical fertilizer treatment. For NO emissions, only biochar amendment decreased fertilizer-driven stimulation (by 80 %, p < 0.05). Notably, the dominant factors that influenced fertilizer-induced N2O and NO emissions in tea gardens were fertilization regimes, climatic conditions, and soil properties. On a global scale, fertilization increased mean N2O and NO emissions (p < 0.05) from global tea gardens by 44.5 Gg N yr-1 and 34.3 Gg N yr-1, respectively, whereas compared with no amendment application, inhibitors reduced N2O emissions (p < 0.05) by 32.2 Gg N yr-1 and biochar reduced NO emissions (p < 0.05) by 23.6 Gg N yr-1.

Evaluation of effectiveness of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers as mitigation options for N2O and NO emissions from agricultural soils: meta-analysis. Agricultural fields are an important anthropogenic source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Although many field studies have tested the effectiveness of possible mitigation options on N2O and NO emissions, the effectiveness of each option varies across sites due to environmental factors and field management. To combine these results and evaluate the overall effectiveness of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers [i.e., nitrification inhibitors (NIs), polymer-coated fertilizers (PCFs), and urease inhibitors (UIs)] on N2O and NO emissions, we performed a meta-analysis using field experiment data (113 datasets from 35 studies) published in peer-reviewed journals through 2008. The results indicated that NIs significantly reduced N2O emissions (mean: -38%, 95% confidential interval: -44% to -31%) compared with those of conventional fertilizers. PCFs also significantly reduced N2O emissions (-35%, -58% to -14%), whereas UIs were not effective in reducing N2O. NIs and PCFs also significantly reduced NO (-46%, -65% to -35%; -40%, -76% to -10%, respectively). The effectiveness of NIs was relatively consistent across the various types of inhibitors and land uses. However, the effect of PCFs showed contrasting results across soil and land-use type: they were significantly effective for imperfectly drained Gleysol grassland (-77%, -88% to -58%), but were ineffective for well-drained Andosol upland fields. Because available data for PCFs were dominated by certain regions and soil types, additional data are needed to evaluate their effectiveness more reliably. NIs were effective in reducing N2O emission from both chemical and organic fertilizers. Moreover, the consistent effect of NIs indicates that they are potent mitigation options for N2O and NO emissions.

Gross nitrogen process rates in temperate forest soils exhibiting symptoms of nitrogen saturation. In order to examine how fundamental soil N cycling processes are affected by elevated N inputs to temperate forest ecosystems, we made concurrent laboratory measurements of gross rates of nitrogen (N) mineralization, nitrification, nitrate (NO(3)(-)) consumption, ammonium (NH(4)(+)) immobilization, nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and nitric oxide (NO) production, and NO consumption in soils from the Harvard Forest Chronic N Amendment Study. Gross nitrification rates varied with N addition rate in a manner that was entirely consistent with patterns of NO(3)(-) leaching and NO emissions that have been previously observed in field studies. Gross nitrification was elevated above controls in soils from a pine stand receiving 5 and 15 g N m(-2) per year, and in soils from a hardwood stand receiving 15 g N m(-2) per year. Gross nitrification tended to increase with decreasing soil pH, suggesting that acid-tolerant nitrifying bacteria predominate in these soils. Different patterns of inorganic N consumption in the two stands may provide some clues to understanding the more rapid onset of N saturation that has been historically observed in the pine stand. Absolute rates of NH(4)(+) immobilization, and rates of NO(3)(-) consumption per unit of available NO(3)(-), each tended to decrease with increasing N addition in the hardwood stand, but did not vary significantly in the pine stand. Gross NO production rates increased in a manner that was consistent with nitrification rate increases, and represented up to 19% of gross nitrification. Production of N(2)O was generally less than or equal to15% of NO production and <1% of gross nitrification. Consumption of NO represented greater than or equal to96% of gross NO production and may have contributed up to 25% of total NO(3)(-) production. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nitric oxide emissions from a southern African savanna. NO fluxes from soils of a periodically flooded tropical savanna in southern Africa were investigated and modeled. In the laboratory, NO production rates, NO consumption rate constants, NO mixing ratios, relationships between NO emissions and soil temperature and moisture were determined for nutrient-poor, nutrient-rich savanna soils and a floodplain soil. The NO production rate and consumption rate constants of the floodplain soil (1.96 ng N s(-1) per kilogram of soil and 2.04 x 10(-5) m(3) s(-1) per kilogram of soil, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the savanna soils (average of 1.28 ng N s(-1) per kilogram of soil and 1.47 x 10(-5) m(3) s(-1) per kilogram of soil, respectively), but there were no significant difference between the nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. NO flux rates increased exponentially with soil temperature. NO flux rates increased with soil moisture reaching a maximum near the field capacity (7.5 - 10% and 31.2% gravimetric water content for savanna and floodplain soils, respectively), after which the NO flux rate declined. These laboratory data were used in a model to estimate field NO flux rates, which were compared with actual field NO emission measurements. The NO model was modified to incorporate NO \"pulsing\" after the first rains of the season. Correlation between the modeled and field NO fluxes from the nutrient-poor savanna, nutrient-rich savanna, and the floodplain soils showed tau(2) values of 0.91, 0.82, and 0.74, respectively. The NO model was linked with a soil moisture and temperature model to predict annual NO emission estimates from savannas. Annual NO flux from the nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich savannas was estimated to be 0.16 x 10(-3) and 0.14 x 10(-3) kg N m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, which agree well with estimates from other savanna studies.

Characterisation of soil emissions of nitric oxide at field and laboratory scale using high resolution method. Agricultural soils may account for 10% of anthropogenic emissions of NO, a precursor of tropospheric ozone with potential impacts on air quality and global warming. However, the estimation of this biogenic source strength and its relationships to crop management is still challenging because of the spatial and temporal variability of the NO fluxes. Here, we present a combination of new laboratory- and field-scale methods to characterise NO emissions and single out the effects of environmental drivers. First, NO fluxes were continuously monitored over the growing season of a maize-cropped field located near Paris (France), using 6 automatic chambers. Mineral fertilizer nitrogen was applied from May to October 2005. An additional field experiment was carried out in October to test the effects of N fertilizer form on the NO emissions. The automatic chambers were designed to measure simultaneously the NO and N(2)O gases. Laboratory measurements were carried out in parallel using soil cores sampled at same site to test the response of NO fluxes to varying soil N-NH(4) and water contents, and temperatures. The effects of soil core thickness were also analysed. The highest NO fluxes occurred during the first 5 weeks following fertilizer application. The cumulative loss of NO-N over the growing season was estimated at 1.5 kg N ha(-1), i.e. 1.1% of the N fertilizer dose (140 kg N ha(-1)). All rainfall events induced NO peak fluxes, whose magnitude decreased over time in relation to the decline of soil inorganic N. In October, NO emissions were enhanced with ammonium forms of fertilizer N. Conversely, the application of nitrate-based fertilizers did not significantly increase NO emissions compared to an unfertilized control. The results of the subsequent laboratory experiments were in accordance with the field observations in magnitude and time variations. NO emissions were maximum with a water soil content of 15% (w w(-1)), and with a NH(4)-N content of 180 mg NH(4)-N kg soil(-1). The response of NO fluxes to soil temperature was fitted with two exponential functions, involving a Q(10) of 2.0 below 20 degrees C and a Q(10) of 1.4 above. Field and laboratory experiments indicated that most of the NO fluxes originated from the top 10 cm of soil. The characterisation of this layer in terms of mean temperature, NH(4) and water contents is thus paramount to explaining the variations of NO fluxes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Soil emissions of nitric oxide in two forest watersheds subjected to elevated N inputs. The production of nitric oxide (NO) in forest soils can indicate that the ecosystem is progressing toward a state of nitrogen (N) saturation. Soil NO emissions may also have impacts on local tropospheric ozone (03) levels. During 2000-2001, we made first-time measurements of NO emissions in two paired watershed studies. In each study, one watershed had been amended with aerial applications of 2.5-3.5 g N m(-2) per year above background atmospheric deposition rates since 1989, and an adjacent watershed served as a reference. In plots at the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF) in West Virginia and the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM), NO emissions in N-amended watersheds (0.61-6.8 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1)) were higher than in the reference watersheds (0.21-1.4 NO-N m(-2) h(-1)). In the N-amended watershed at BBWM, NO fluxes in plots dominated by hardwood species were higher than in plots dominated by softwood species, in contrast to previous studies in other forests. Field NO fluxes were correlated with mineral soil nitrate (NO3-) Concentrations (r(2) = 0.65, P = 0.016) across all plots, suggesting that NO emissions may be a reliable indicator of NO3- leaching potential. Laboratory experiments indicated that nitrification was the dominant source of NO at both sites. At BBWM, increased NO emissions in N-amended soil appeared to result from more rapid nitrification. In contrast, reduced soil pH in N-amended soil at FEF may have caused increased protonation of nitrification-derived nitrite, and the subsequent abiotic formation of NO, even though nitrification rates were not significantly higher than in unamended soil. The results suggest that enhanced soil NO emissions are a characteristic response in forests subjected to elevated N inputs. One possible consequence of higher NO emissions is an increase in O-3-related phytotoxicity. This effect may mitigate the ability of forests to accumulate carbon in response to N inputs or increasing atmospheric CO,. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The short-lived inhibitory effect of Brachiaria humidicola on nitrous oxide emissions following sheep urine application in a highly nitrifying soil. Background Brachiaria humidicola (Bh) has the ability to produce biological nitrification inhibitors (NIs) and release NIs from the root to the soil. Aims To compare the effects of growing Bh with Brachiaria ruziziensis (Br, which is not able to produce NIs) on soil nitrogen (N) dynamics, N gases and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and nitrifiers and denitrifiers following sheep urine application, a laboratory incubation was conducted in a He/O-2 continuous flow denitrification system (DENIS). This incubation was conducted in the absence of light. Hence the measured effects of Bh and Br on N cycling were the residual effect of biological NIs released into the soil prior to the incubation and released via root death. Methods The treatments were: (1) Bh with water application (Bh + W); (2) Bh with sheep urine (Bh + U); (3) Br with water application (Br + W); (4) Br with sheep urine (Br + U). Results Results showed that soil NO3- concentration increased significantly in the soil with sheep urine application after the incubation. Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions increased immediately after the sheep urine application and peaked twice during the incubation. Cumulative emissions for the first peak were significantly lower from the Bh + U treatment (0.054 kg N ha(-1)) compared with the Br + U treatment (0.111 kg N ha(-1)), but no significant differences were observed in the total cumulative N2O and NO emissions between the Bh + U and Br + U treatment at the end of the incubation. Sheep urine addition did not affect the AOA, nirS and nosZ gene copies, but significantly increased the AOB gene copies after the incubation. Conclusions We conclude that the residual effect of Bh to mitigate N2O emissions in a highly nitrifying soil is short-lived.

SOIL ATMOSPHERE EXCHANGE OF NITROUS-OXIDE, NITRIC-OXIDE, AND METHANE UNDER SECONDARY SUCCESSION OF PASTURE TO FOREST IN THE ATLANTIC LOWLANDS OF COSTA-RICA. We investigated changes in soil-atmosphere flux of CH4, N2O, and NO resulting from the succession of pasture to forest in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica. We studied a dozen sites intensively for over one year in order to measure rates and to understand controlling mechanisms for gas exchange. CH4 flux was controlled primarily by soil moisture content. Soil consumption of atmospheric CH4 was greatest when soils were relatively dry. Forest soils consumed CH4 while pasture soils which had poor drainage generally produced CH4. The seasonal pattern of N2O emissions from forest soils was related exponentially to soil water-filled pore space. Annual average N2O emissions correlated with soil exchangeable NO3- concentrations. Soil-atmosphere NO flux was greatest when soils were relatively dry. We found the largest NO emissions from abandoned pasture sites. Combining these data with those from another study in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica that focused on deforestation, we present a 50-year chronosequence of trace gas emissions that extends from natural conditions, through disturbance and natural recovery. The soil-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 and N2O and of NO may be restored to predisturbance rates during secondary succession. The changes in trace gas emissions following deforestation, through pasture use and secondary succession, may be explained conceptually through reference to two major controlling factors, nitrogen availability and soil-atmosphere diffusive exchange of gases as it is influenced by soil moisture content and soil compaction.

Nitrous oxide emission reduced by coated nitrate fertilizer in a cool-temperate region. Application of coated nitrate fertilizers is expected to be a possible strategy to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils of croplands. To evaluate the effects of coated nitrate fertilizer application on N2O emissions from soils, N2O fluxes were measured in a carrot field from 2016 to 2017. Ammonium sulfate (AS), coated urea (CU; only in 2017), coated calcium nitrate (CC), and no-nitrogen (NN) fertilizers were investigated. No recognizable increase in N2O flux was observed for about 45 days after fertilization in all the plots in 2016. In 2017, significant simultaneous increases in N2O and nitric oxide fluxes (up to 142 and 436 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), respectively) were found only in the AS plots in spring, indicating enhancement of N2O production via nitrification. After mid-July, the N2O fluxes increased temporarily with the increase in soil water content after rainfall in all the plots including the NN plots in 2016 (up to 183-342 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and 2017 (up to 56-86 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)), indicating N2O production mainly via denitrification. Cumulative N2O emissions did not differ significantly among all the treatments in 2016, whereas that in the CC plots was significantly lower than that in the AS plots by 36% in 2017. These results suggest that the application of coated calcium nitrate fertilizers can reduce emissions of N2O produced via nitrification and can thus reduce cumulative N2O emissions in fields where nitrification is the major N2O production process in the soil.

Biogenic NO emissions from savanna soils as a function of fire regime, soil type, soil nitrogen, and water status. A study of NOx emissions from soils representative of nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich savannas and their response to burning and soil water content was carried out in the southern Kruger National Park, South Africa. The study spanned the end of the dry season and the beginning of the wet season (September-December 1992). Nitrogen mineralization rates were measured using an in situ technique simultaneously with measurements of NOx emissions. NOx emissions were almost entirely as NO. The relationship between NO emission rate and soil moisture was parabolic regardless of soil type and management practice, with the lowest NO emission rates being measured at low (<0.087) and high (>0.542) water-filled pore space values. The initial increase in NO emission rates with increasing soil moisture are paralleled by increases in the nitrate concentration in the soil. The highest NO emission rates (20 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1)-excluding the brief initial peak) were measured on plots from which fire had been excluded for 35 years. The next highest rates (8 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1)) were measured on the more fertile soils. Infertile soils, burned every second year, had rates of 3.5 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1). The NO emission rates show a positive correlation with soil total N content and N nitrification rate. The effect of excluding fire from a savanna is to increase the soil nitrogen content through increased litter inputs, which in turn increases nitrification rates and soil NO emissions.

Soil Moisture Control of NO Turnover and N2O Release in Nitrogen-Saturated Subtropical Forest Soils. Acid forest soils in South China experience a chronically elevated input of atmospheric nitrogen (N), turning them into hot spots for gaseous N emissions. Soil moisture is known to be a major controller for the partitioning of gaseous N loss to nitric (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which may be of particular relevance in the monsoonal climate of South China. To study this partitioning in more detail, we determined gas phase kinetics of NO and N2O release during laboratory dry-out of acidic surface soils from the headwater catchment TieShanPing (TSP), situated close to Chongqing, SW China. Soils were sampled from two hydrologically distinct environments, a well-drained hill slope (HS), and a periodically flooded groundwater discharge zone (GDZ). Production and consumption of NO were studied in an automated flow-through system purged with NO-free or NO-spiked air. Production rates peaked at 21% and 18% water filled pore space (WFPS) in HS and GDZ soils, respectively, suggesting nitrification as the dominant process of NO formation in both landscape units. In HS soils, maximum production and consumption occurred at the same WFPS, whereas GDZ soils displayed maximum NO consumption at higher WFPS than maximum production, suggesting that denitrification is an important NO sink in GDZ soils. Net N2O release was largest at 100% WFPS and declined steadily during drying. Integrated over the entire range of soil moisture, potential NO-N loss outweighed potential N2O-N loss, suggesting that N-saturated, acid forest soil is an important NO source.

Nitrification is the primary source for NO in N-saturated subtropical forest soils: Results from in situ 15N labeling. Rationale Acidic subtropical forest soils that receive high atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition have been identified as important sources of nitric oxide (NO). The relative importance of major processes producing NO is unclear. Methods To partition NO sources, we conducted an in situ tracing experiment with (NH4NO3)-N-15 and (NH4NO3)-N-15 in well-drained acid soils of an N-saturated subtropical forest in Chongqing, southwest China. Results In the (NH4NO3)-N-15 treatment, the N-15 signature of NO emitted from the foot of the hillslope (Lower site) was similar to that of the NH4+ pool, indicating predominant autotrophic nitrification for NO formation. In the (NH4NO3)-N-15 treatment, the N-15 enrichment of NO was smaller than that of the NO3- pool, suggesting minor contribution of denitrification to NO production (15%). Conclusions Nitrification is the main process responsible for NO emissions, even in monsoonal summers when soil water-filled pore space values are relatively high.

The mechanisms governing low denitrification capacity and high nitrogen oxide gas emissions in subtropical forest soils in China. Previous studies have demonstrated that denitrification rates are low in subtropical forest soils. However, the mechanisms governing this process are not well known. This study seeks to identify the mechanisms responsible for the low denitrification capacity and high nitrogen oxide gas ratio in subtropical forest soils in China. The denitrification capacity and nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen (N-2) emission rates were measured using the acetylene inhibition method under conditions of added nitrate and anoxia. The abundance of nitrate reductase (narG), nitrite reductase (nirK), nitric oxide reductase (cnorB), and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) was measured using real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of the nirK and norB products was performed to analyze the population structure of denitrifying bacteria. These results showed that the denitrification capacity in subtropical forest soils was lower than in temperate forest soils (p<0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that redox potential at the start of incubation (Eh(i)), rather than soil pH or soil organic C, was the key soil variable influencing denitrification, and Eh(i) alone could explain 68% of the variations in denitrification capacity. The high Eh(i) in subtropical soils led to a low abundance of nirK and significant differences in the population structure of denitrifying bacteria between subtropical and temperate soils. Therefore, Eh(i) was responsible for the low denitrification capacity in subtropical forest soils. The ratio of NO to total denitrification gas products (p<0.01) and the ratio of NO and N2O to total denitrification gas products (p<0.05) were significantly higher in subtropical forest soils than in temperate forest soils, while the reverse trend was observed for the ratio of N-2 to total denitrification gas products (p<0.05). A high Eh(i) reduced the specific reduction activity of each nosZ copy and, in turn, resulted in a large ratio of NO and N2O to total denitrification gas products in subtropical soils. Thus, NO and N2O, but not N-2, were the dominant denitrification gas products, accounting for 80%, even under the highly anaerobic conditions in subtropical forest soils and despite low denitrification capacity. These results were significant for understanding the Hole in the Pipe model and NO and N2O gases emission in subtropical forest soils. Despite the fact that the nitrogen flowing through the pipe (denitrification capacity) was low, the large holes in the pipe resulted in a large quantity of NO and N2O gases leaking out. This leakage may be a potential mechanism for the high levels of NO and N2O gas emission in subtropical forest soils and could partly explain why NO and N2O emissions are generally high in subtropical and tropical soils.

Short-term effects of tillage and compaction on nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, methane and carbon dioxide fluxes from grassland. N2O, NO, NO2, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were measured simultaneously from tilled and compacted soil in a factorial design to investigate the effect of management on trace gas emissions. Six treatments in combinations of with and without N application, tillage and compaction were investigated for a period of 3 weeks using the closed-chamber technique (for N2O, CO2 and CH4) and the open-chamber technique (for NO and NO2). Total NO emissions from the tilled plots were 2.4 times greater than from the non-tilled plots, whereas CO2 emissions were 1.8 times greater from the non-tilled plots. Compaction increased the emissions of N2O and CH4 3.5- and 4.4-fold, respectively, compared with emissions from uncompacted plots. The effects of tillage and compaction on the gaseous emissions are discussed in relation to their production, transport and lifetime within the soil. The results showed that the best option for reducing gaseous emission from fertilised soil, with regards to tillage or compaction, would be the least compacted system, regardless of the tillage status as reflected, at least in the short term, by minimal emissions of N2O and CH4 and to some extent those of NO, NO2 and CO2.

Synergistic effects of biogenic volatile organic compounds and soil nitric oxide emissions on summertime ozone formation in China. Natural emissions play a key role in modulating the formation of ground-level ozone (O-3), especially emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and soil nitric oxide (SNO), and their individual effects on O-3 formation have been previously quantified and evaluated. However, their synergistic effects remain unclear and have not yet been well assessed. By applying the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Chemistry Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (WRF/Chem-MEGAN) model, this study reveals that in the presence of sufficient BVOC emissions, which act as a fuel, SNO emissions act as a fuel additive and promote the chemical reactions of BVOCs and the subsequent production of O-3. Consequently, the synergistic effects of BVOC and SNO emissions on summertime O-3 production surpassed the sum of their individual effects by as much as 10-20 mu g m(-3) in eastern China in 2014. In order to reduce O-3 concentration to a level corresponding to no natural emissions of BVOC or SNO (i.e., the BASE scenario), the anthropogenic volatile organic compound (AVOC) emissions in the scenario considers BVOC and SNO emissions must be reduced by 1.76 times that of the BASE scenario. This study demonstrates that the synergistic effects of BVOC and SNO emissions can impede ground-level O-3 regulation and can subsequently impose stricter requirements on anthropogenic precursor emission control in China. The results of this study can also inform efforts in other regions that are still combating ground-level O-3 pollution.

Effects of nitrate and water content on acetylene inhibition technique bias when analysing soil denitrification rates under an aerobic atmosphere. The acetylene inhibition technique (AIT) is the most widely used indirect method of determining denitrification fluxes. Although AIT bias has long been recognised, the contributions of soil denitrification-related parameters to this bias have not yet been well quantified. Using a direct-N-2 method as a baseline, we determined the composition of AIT bias and quantified the effects of soil nitrate (NO3-) and water contents on AIT bias under an aerobic atmosphere. The results showed that the AIT severely underestimated the denitrification rate by 5-26 times and failed to capture the dynamic of denitrification with increasing soil water content. The bias increased with increases in the soil NO3- and water contents. Acetylene-catalysed nitric oxide (NO) oxidation accounted on average for 60% (ranging from 31 to 79%) of the bias. The remaining bias was caused by incomplete acetylene inhibition of nitrous oxide (N2O) reduction. Our results indicate that the AIT method is not recommended for denitrification determination under an aerobic atmosphere, especially for soils with high NO3- and water contents.

Comparison of N losses (NO3-, N2O, NO) from surface applied, injected or amended (DCD) pig slurry of an irrigated soil in a Mediterranean climate. Nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), denitrification losses and NO3 leaching from an irrigated sward were quantified under Mediterranean conditions. The effect of injected pig slurry (IPS) with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) was evaluated and also compared with that of a surface pig slurry application (SPS) and a control treatment (Control) without fertiliser. After application, fluxes of NO and N2O peaked from SPS (3.06 mg NO-N m(-2) d(-1) and 108 mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)) and IPS (3.50 mg NO-N m(-2) d(-1) and 105 mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)). However, when irrigation was applied, N2O and NO emissions declined. The total N2O and denitrification losses were slightly large from IPS than from SPS, although the differences were not significant (P < 0.05). Emission of NO was not affected by the method of pig slurry application. DCD inhibited nitrification during the first 20-30 days and reduced N2O and NO emissions from pig slurry by at least 46% and 37%, respectively. Considering the 215 days following pig slurry application, the emission factor of N2O based on N fertiliser was 1.60% (SPS), 2.95% (IPS), and 0.50% (IPS + DCD). The emission factor for NO was 0.14% (SPS), 0.12% (IPS), and 0.02% (IPS + DCD). Environmental conditions of the crop favoured the denitrification process as the most important source of N2O during the experimental period. The differences in the denitrification rate between treatments could be explained by the pattern of water soluble carbon (WSC), that was the highest value in injected pig slurry (with and without DCD). Due to low drainage (5% of water applied), leaching losses of NO3 were lower than those of denitrification from the upper soil layer (0-10 cm) in all treatments and especially with IPS + DCD, where the nitrification inhibitor was very efficient in reducing leaching losses.

Most N(2)O/NO ratios calculated on the basis of these N(2)O and NO fluxes ranged between I and 100, and the log-normal N(2)O/NO ratio was positively correlated with the log-normal N(2)O fluxes (r(2) = 0.346, P < 0.01). These high N(2)O fluxes, therefore, resulted from increased denitrification activity. Annual N(2)O emission rates ranged from -1.0 to 81 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (average = 6.6 kg N ha(-1)). As these emission values varied greatly and included extremely high values, we divided them into two groups: normal values (i.e. values lower than the overall average) and high values (i.e. values higher than average). The normal data were significantly positively correlated with N input (r(2) = 0.61, P < 0.01) and the \"higher\" data from ungrazed fields were significantly positively correlated with N surplus (r(2) = 0.96, P < 0.05). The calculated probability that a high N(2)O flux would occur was weakly and positively correlated with precipitation from May to August. This probability can be used to represent annual variation in N(2)O emission rates and to reduce the uncertainty in N(2)O estimation.

Quantifying nitric oxide emissions under rice-wheat cropping systems. Urea deep placement (UDP) increases nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and crop yields while reducing nitrogen (N) losses to the environment. However, studies on its environmental impacts on nitric oxide (NO) emissions are still limited. Therefore, we conducted a greenhouse experiment to quantify the NO emissions from a rice-wheat system. NO emissions were measured from three N fertilizer treatments - control (no N), UDP, and broadcast prilled urea (PU) - using an automated gas sampling and analysis system continuously for a rice-wheat cropping cycle. In rice, UDP was tested under two water regimes - continuous flooding (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). Fertilizer treatments had significant effects (p <0.05) on NO emissions. UDP with AWD irrigation increased NO emissions (3.41 gN ha(-1)) (p < 0.05) by 2.5-times compared to UDP with CF (1.35 g N ha(-1)). But emissions were similar between UDP and broadcast PU under the CF water regime. In wheat, the application of N fertilizer - regardless of application methods - increased NO emissions (615 g N ha(-1), average across application methods) by 10-times over control (62.52 g N ha(-1)). However, emissions were not significantly (P> 0.05) different among the treatments. Fertilizer induced emission factors (EFs) were not affected by N placement methods in either rice or wheat. On average, EFs in the rice were very low (<0.002%) compared to the wheat (0.5%). This study reveals that (regardless of treatments), the contribution of rice (<4 g N ha(-1)) on total annual NO emissions (433 g N ha(-1)) was very small (<0.5%) compared to emissions from wheat.

Nitrification inhibitor DMPSA mitigated N2O emission and promoted NO sink in rainfed wheat. Fertilized cropping systems are important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) to the atmosphere, and biotic and abiotic processes control the production and consumption of these gases in the soil. In fact, the inhibition of nitrification after application of urea or an ammonium-based fertilizer to agricultural soils has resulted in an efficient strategy to mitigate both N2O and NO in aerated agricultural soils. Therefore, the NO and N2O mitigation capacity of a novel nitrification inhibitor (NI), 2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA), has been studied in a winter wheat crop. A high temporal resolution of fluxes of NO and NO2, obtained by using automatic chambers for urea (U) and urea with DMPSA, allowed a better understanding of the temporal net emissions of these gases under field conditions. Seventy-five days after fertilization, the effective reduction of nitrification by DMPSA significantly decreased the production of NO with respect to the treatment without it, giving net consumption of NO in the soil (-61.72 g-N ha(-1)) for U DMPSA in comparison to net production (227.44 g-N ha(-1)) for U. The explanation of NO deposition after NI application, due to biotic and abiotic processes in the soil-plant system, supposes a challenge that needs to be studied in the future. In the case of N2O, the addition of DMPSA significantly mitigated the emissions of this gas by 71%, though the total N2O emissions in both fertilized treatments were significantly greater than those of the control (43.69 g-N ha(-1)). Regarding the fertilized treatments, no significant effect of DMPSA in comparison to urea alone was observed on grain yield nor bread-making wheat quality. To sum up, we got a significant reduction of N2O and NO with the addition of DMPSA, without a loss in yield and quality parameters in wheat. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of phosphorus addition with and without ammonium, nitrate, or glucose on N2O and NO emissions from soil sampled under Acacia mangium plantation and incubated at 100 % of the water-filled pore space. An incubation experiment was conducted to examine the effects of phosphorus (P) addition with and without ammonium, nitrate, or glucose on N2O and NO emissions from soil taken under Acacia mangium plantation and incubated at 100 % water-filled pore space (WFPS). Additions of NO (3) (-) stimulated the N2O and NO emissions while NH (4) (+) did not, showing that denitrification was the main process of N2O and NO production in the study condition. When NO (3) (-) was added with P significantly (P < 0.05) increased N2O emissions regardless of the ratio of the added nitrogen and carbon, suggesting that P addition stimulated denitrification activity. The activation of denitrification by P addition is possibly attributed to two mechanisms: (1) the added-P stimulated denitrification by relieving P shortage for denitrifying bacteria and (2) the added-P stimulated activity of heterotrophic soil microflora with increased O-2 consumption promoting the development of anaerobic conditions with stimulation of denitrification.

Model development. A process-oriented model of N2O and NO emissions from forest soils: 1. Model development. To predict emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) from forest soils, we have developed a process-oriented model by integrating several new features with three existing models, PnET, Denitriftcation-Decomposition (DNDC), and a nitrification model. In the new model, two components were established to predict (1) the effects of ecological drivers (e.g., climate, soil, vegetation, and anthropogenic activity) on soil environmental factors (e.g., temperature, moisture, pH, redox potential, and substrates concentrations), and (2) effects of the soil environmental factors on the biochemical or geochemical reactions which govern NO and N2O production and consumption. The first component consists of three submodels for predicting soil climate, forest growth, and turnover of soil organic matter. The second component contains two submodels for nitrification and denitrification. A kinetic scheme, a so-called \"anaerobic balloon,\" was developed to calculate the anaerobic status of the soil and divide the soil into aerobic and anaerobic fractions. Nitrification is only allowed to occur in the aerobic fraction, while denitrification occurs only in the anaerobic fraction. The size of the anaerobic balloon is defined by the simulated oxygen partial pressure which is calculated based on oxygen diffusion and consumption rates in the soil. As the balloon swells or shrinks, the model dynamically allocates substrates (e.g., dissolved organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate, etc.) into the aerobic and anaerobic fractions. With this approach, the model is able to predict both nitrification and denitrification in the same soil at the same time. This feature is important for soils where aerobic and anaerobic microsites often exist simultaneously. With the kinetic framework as well as its interacting functions, the PnET-N-DNDC model links ecological drivers to trace gas emissions. Tests for validating the new model are published in a companion paper [Stange er al., this issue]. C1 Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA.

Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in an acid Oxisol in western Puerto Rico: Effects of tillage, liming and fertilization. Changes in land use and management of tropical systems are considered to be major factors in the recent upsurge in increases in atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Studies were initiated in western Puerto Rico grasslands to determine the effect of plowing, or liming and fertilizing an acid Oxisol on the soil-atmosphere exchanges of N2O and CH4. Weekly field flux measurements and field manipulation and laboratory studies were conducted over 22 months during 1993-1995. We found that N2O emissions from an Oxisol acidified to pH 4 were generally lower than from pH 6 Oxisol soils that were used as reference controls. Plowing the grasslands did not change mean N2O emission rates from either pH soil. Liming the acidified Oxisol to pH 6 tended to increase N2O emissions to the rates from the undisturbed grassland. Fertilizing the acidified grassland increased N2O emissions but much less than when these soils were both limed and fertilized. Short-term held studies employing nitrification inhibitors in which we measured nitric oxide (NO) and N2O, emissions, demonstrated that nitrification rates generally control N2O emissions; thus these were lower in unlimed soil. It is likely that NO was produced through the chemical decomposition of nitrite, which in turn, was a product of biological nitrification. Soil consumption of atmospheric CH4 in the acidified Oxisol was about one-fourth of that in the pH 6 reference soil. Liming did not restore CH4 consumption in the acid soil to rates comparable to those in the reference Oxisol. We conducted a laboratory induction study to determine if incubation of these limed or unlimed acidified soils with high concentrations of CH4 could induce methanotrophic activity. Comparable uptake rates to the control soils were not induced by these incubations. These studies illustrate that management of soil can considerably affect the soil-atmosphere exchange of such trace gases as N2O and CH4 which can affect global atmospheric properties.

Mechanistic modeling of nitrite accumulation and nitrogen oxide gas emissions during nitrification. Nitrite (NO2-) accumulation in soil following nitrogen (N) fertilizer application has been observed under a variety of conditions. The presence of NO2- together with soil acidity results in the formation of nitrous acid (HNO2), which decomposes abiotically to produce nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). These N oxide trace gases have potential effects on several atmospheric processes. Presented here is a model that describes some of the interactions between microbial, chemical, and physical processes that influence NO2- accumulation and N oxide gas emissions following applications of NH4+-based fertilizers. The model is applied to hypothetical, and actual field scenarios. A two-step, two-population nitrification submodel is linked to gas production and transformation submodels. Transport of all chemical species occurs by diffusion. The model results suggest that some degree of transient nitrite accumulation following NH4+ application is a consequence of the nature of nitrification itself. Model simulations and sensitivity analysis indicate that (i) soils receiving similar fertilizer treatments but differing in their ability to buffer nitrification-induced acidity may produce dramatically different N oxide gas emissions, (ii) subsurface fertilizer placement can significantly reduce net NO emissions, and (iii) the differential responses of Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter populations to chemical toxicities associated with the form and/or rate of fertilizer application may significantly affect the extent of NO2- accumulation and corresponding gas emissions. Overall, the results contribute to our basic understanding of how multiple microbial, chemical, and physical factors can interact to control the net soil-to-atmosphere emission of nitrification-derived NO and N2O.

Influence of modelled soil biogenic NO emissions on related trace gases and the atmospheric oxidizing efficiency. The emission of nitric oxide (NO) by soils (SNOx) is an important source of oxides of nitrogen (NOx=NO+NO2) in the troposphere, with estimates ranging from 4 to 21 Tg of nitrogen per year. Previous studies have examined the influence of SNOx on ozone (O-3) chemistry. We employ the ECHAM5/MESSy atmospheric chemistry model (EMAC) to go further in the reaction chain and investigate the influence of SNOx on lower tropospheric NOx, O-3, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), nitric acid (HNO3), the hydroxyl radical (OH) and the lifetime of methane (tau(CH4)). We show that SNOx is responsible for a significant contribution to the NOx mixing ratio in many regions, especially in the tropics. Furthermore, the concentration of OH is substantially increased due to SNOx, resulting in an enhanced oxidizing efficiency of the global troposphere, reflected in a similar to 10% decrease in tau(CH4) due to soil NO emissions. On the other hand, in some regions SNOx has a negative feedback on the lifetime of NOx through O-3 and OH, which results in regional increases in the mixing ratio of NOx despite lower total emissions in a simulation without SNOx. In a sensitivity simulation in which we reduce the other surface NOx emissions by the same amount as SNOx, we find that they have a much weaker impact on OH and tau(CH4) and do not result in an increase in the NOx mixing ratio anywhere.

Nitrous oxide emissions for 6 years from a gray lowland soil cultivated with onions in Hokkaido, Japan. We studied nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions every growing season (April to October) for 6 years (1995similar to2000), in a Gray Lowland soil cultivated with onions in central Hokkaido, Japan. Emission of N2O from the onion field ranged from 0.00 to 1.86 mgN m(-2) h(-1). The seasonal pattern of N2O emission was the same for 6 years. The largest N2O emissions appeared near harvesting in August to October, and not, as might be expected, just after fertilization in May. The seasonal patterns of soil nitrate (NO3-) and, ammonium (NH4+) levels and the ratio of N2O to NO emission indicated that the main process of N2O production after fertilization was nitrification, and the main process of N2O production around harvest time was denitrification. N2O emission was strongly influenced by the drying-wetting process of the soil, as well as by the high soil water content. The annual N2O emission during the growing season ranged from 3.5 to 15.6 kgN ha(-1). The annual nitrogen loss by N2O emission as a percentage of fertilizer-N ranged from 1.1 to 6.4%. About 70% of the annual N2O emission occurred near harvesting in August to October, and less than 20% occurred just after fertilization in May to July. High N2O fluxes around the harvesting stage and a high proportion of N2O emission to total fertilizer-N appeared to be probably a characteristic of the study area located in central Hokkaido, Japan.

NITRIC AND NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS AND SOIL NITRATE DISTRIBUTION IN A CENTER-PIVOT-IRRIGATED CORNFIELD. Research on soil N loss mechanisms remains a high priority not only because of the need to increase agricultural N use efficiency, but also because of environmental concerns such as NO3- contamination of groundwater and increasing N oxide concentrations in the atmosphere. We measured NO and N2O emissions and downward movement of NO3- in an eastern Colorado corn (Zea mays L.) field irrigated with a modified center-pivot system that applied water to alternate furrows. One hour after infiltration of the irrigation water, emission rates measured by an enclosure method ranged from 0 to 6 g N ha-1 d-1 for NO and 0 to 26 g N ha-1 d-1 for NA The emission rates were largest after the first irrigation and much smaller following subsequent irrigations. Greater N oxide evolution from nonirrigated furrows than adjacent irrigated furrows probably resulted from lateral transport of gases produced in the wet soil. Analyses of soil cores taken after planting and after harvest provided no evidence that NO3- moved below the root zone during the growing season, despite the presence of substantially more inorganic N than required for maximum corn yield. These data suggest that when the size and frequency of irrigations are efficiently managed, use of a low energy precision application (LEPA) irrigation system results in no N loss to groundwater and no economically significant gaseous N oxide loss to the atmosphere.

Nitrite accumulation and nitrogen gas production increase with decreasing temperature in urea-amended soils: Experiments and modeling. Nitrite (NO2-) accumulation and associated production of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases in soils amended with nitrogen (N) fertilizers are well documented, but there remains a poor understanding of their regulation and variation among soil types. We examined responses to urea inputs in two soils at five temperatures from 5 to 30 degrees C and developed a process-driven model to describe the dynamics. A microcosm system was used to measure ammonia gas (NH3), ammonium (NH4+), NO2-, nitrate (NO3-), NO, N2O and pH over 12 weeks. Unexpectedly, NO2-, NO and N2O production tended to increase as soil temperature declined in both soils. The maximum NO2- concentration, or compensation point (CP), differed by soil type but the time required to reach CP decreased exponentially with increasing temperature in both soils. A two-step nitrification model ('2SN') accounted for interactions of ammonia-oxidation (AmO), nitrite oxidation (NiO), urea hydrolysis, NH4- sorption, N gas production and pH dynamics. Both steps of nitrification (AmO and NiO) were modeled using NH3 inhibition kinetics. The model adequately simulated the observed dynamics and temperature responses and showed that increased uncoupling of AmO and NiO at colder temperatures resulted from their differential temperature responses. The dynamics observed here may be important following high-rate and banded N fertilizer applications and in ruminant urine patches. The results may help explain elevated N2O emissions observed under cold temperatures. The 2SN model can account for interactions among multiple processes and may be useful for studying the effects of management practices and climate factors, including climate change scenarios, on soil N cycling.

Aqueous and gaseous nitrogen losses induced by fertilizer application. In recent years, concern has grown over the contribution of nitrogen (N) fertilizer use to nitrate (NO3-) water pollution and nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide ( NO), and ammonia (NH3) atmospheric pollution. Characterizing soil N effluxes is essential in developing a strategy to mitigate N leaching and emissions to the atmosphere. In this paper, a previously described and tested mechanistic N cycle model (TOUGHREACT-N) was successfully tested against additional observations of soil pH and N2O emissions after fertilization and irrigation and before plant emergence. We used TOUGHREACT-N to explain the significantly different N gas emissions and nitrate leaching rates resulting from the different N fertilizer types, application methods, and soil properties. The N2O emissions from NH4+-N fertilizer were higher than from urea and NO3--N fertilizers in coarse-textured soils. This difference increased with decreases in fertilization application rate and increases in soil buffering capacity. In contrast to methods used to estimate global terrestrial gas emissions, we found strongly nonlinear N2O emissions as a function of fertilizer application rate and soil calcite content. Speciation of predicted gas N flux into N2O and N-2 depended on pH, fertilizer form, and soil properties. Our results highlighted the need to derive emission and leaching factors that account for fertilizer type, application method, and soil properties.

Acidic northern soils as sources of atmospheric nitrous acid (HONO). The photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) is an important source of OH radical, the key oxidizing agent in the atmosphere. Recently it has been reported that nitrite (NO2-) in boil can also be a source of atmospheric HONO, in addition to the other pathways, e.g. the hydrolysis of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on wet surfaces. However, the production rates of MONO in various soils are unknown. We selected a range of dominant northern acidic soils and showed in microcosm experiments that soils which have the highest nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions (drained peatlands) also have the highest MONO production rates. It is known that in natural peatlands with high water table and in boreal coniferous forest soils, low nitrification activity (microbial production of nitrite and nitrate) limits their N2O production. Low availability of nitrite in these soils is the likely reason also for their low MONO production rates. Lowering of water table of peatlands as a result of drainage or climate change enhances their nitrification activity and N2O/NO production and as shown here also their HONO production. Also nitrogen deposition, or nitrogen fertilization and other land-use practices increasing availability of mineral nitrogen can be expected to enhance HONO emissions from soils.

Broadcast Urea Reduces N2O but Increases NO Emissions Compared with Conventional and Shallow-Applied Anhydrous Ammonia in a Coarse-Textured Soil. Despite the importance of anhydrous ammonia (AA) and urea as nitrogen (N) fertilizer sources in the United States, there have been few direct comparisons of their effects on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. We compared N oxide emissions, yields, and N fertilizer recovery efficiency (NFRE) in a corn (Zea mays L.) production system that used three different fertilizer practices: urea that was broadcast and incorporated (BU) and AA that was injected at a conventional depth (0.20 m) (AAc) and at a shallower depth (0.10 m) (AAs). Averaged over 2 yr in an irrigated loamy sand in Minnesota, growing season N2O emissions increased in the order BU < AAc < AAs. In contrast, NO emissions were greater with BU than with AAc or AAs. Emissions of N2O ranged from 0.5 to 1.4 kg N ha(-1) (50-140 g N Mg-1 grain), while NO emissions ranged from 0.2 to 0.7 kg N ha(-1) (20-70 g N Mg-1 grain). Emissions of total N oxides (NO + N2O) increased in the order AAc < BU < AAs. Despite having the greatest emissions of N2O and total N oxides, the AAs treatment had greater NFRE compared with the AAc treatment. These results provide additional evidence that AA emits more N2O, but less NO, than broadcast urea and show that practices to reduce N2O emissions do not always improve N use efficiency.

Nitrogen oxides emissions from coastal wetland sediments: Experimental assessment of the influence of vegetation and nitrogen input.

With exogenous nitrogen input from anthropogenic activities, wetland sediments become active emission hotspots for NOx. x . In this study, we conducted field experiments in a typical salt marsh wetland to measure nitric oxide (NO, the primary component of NOx x from sediments) exchange fluxes in both mudflat and vegetated sediments. We found that NO fluxes in vegetated sediments (0.40 +/- 0.15 x 10-12 kg N m- 2 s-1)-1 ) were relatively higher than in mudflat sediments (-1.31 +/- 1.39 x 10-12 kg N m- 2 s-- 1 ), with this difference occurring only during the vegetation-dying season (autumn). Correlations between sediment NO fluxes and environmental parameters revealed that NO flux variation during the observation period was primarily influenced by sediment respiration, temperature, water content, and substrate availability. However, the influence of these factors on NO fluxes differed between mudflat and vegetated sediments. In-situ data analysis also suggested that tidal horizontal migration, which affects sediment substrate and salinity, may regulate sediment NO emissions. Furthermore, in-situ incubations with nitrogen addition (ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate) were conducted to study the response of sediment NO emissions to exogenous nitrogen. We observed that nitrogen addition caused a 259.7 % increase in NO emissions from vegetated sediments compared to the control during the effective period of nitrogen addition (days 1-3). However, although nitrogen addition markedly stimulated sediment NO emissions, the overall NO production capacity constrained the extent of this increase.

Deposition and emissions of reactive nitrogen over European forests: A modelling study. The EMEP MSC-W Eulerian chemical transport model is used to investigate a number of features concerning the concentrations and depositions of reactive nitrogen species over Europe, with a focus on forest ecosystems and soil emissions. We illustrate the relative contributions of oxidised versus reduced nitrogen, and of dry versus wet deposition, to nitrogen inputs to forests. A comparison with measurements, including data for the NOFRETETE sites, showed that the EMEP model performs generally well for N-compounds, although with some problems for NH3 which is difficult to model with a large-scale model. The model was modified to make use of a new forest-soil-NO inventory (with daily resolution) from the NOFRETETE project and used to calculate the potential effects of these emissions on N-deposition to forests, and on the ozone-indicator AOT40. The contribution of soil-NO to these environmental measures was found to be generally small, but significant in some areas, with changes ranging between 0-20% in Central Europe and even greater in Scandinavia. Given the large uncertainties in soil-NO emission estimates, it is clear that this source is potentially comparable in its importance to many combustion sources in parts of Europe, and deserves more attention.

Sheepfolds as \"hotspots\" of nitric oxide (NO) emission in an Inner Mongolian steppe. We investigated nitric oxide (NO) fluxes at a summer and a winter sheepfold in the Baiyinxile livestock farm, near Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia, which are a typical feature of the regional husbandry. Using a manual static opaque chamber/chemiluminescence measuring system, we intermittently observed fluxes in the summer sheepfold between May 28th and September 26th 2005 and in both winter and summer sheepfolds between March 8th and October 18th 2006. During these periods, mean NO emissions (+/- S.E., in terms of mass of nitrogen) were 124.0 +/- 28.7, 134.6 +/- 23.3 (summer sheepfold) and 214.4 +/- 79.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) (winter sheepfold), respectively, and thus, three magnitudes higher than observed steppe NO emissions in the same region. The NO fluxes were not significantly different between the 2 years, but in summer they were much higher than in spring (p < 0.05). Temperature and moisture of the faeces layer significantly regulated the NO fluxes (p < 0.01). The direct NO emission factor (EF) for faeces and urine excreted in the sheepfolds was 0.7 g NO-N-emitted kg(-1) N-excreted, which was almost 37 times lower than a recently reported N2O EF. We estimated the total No emission from the sheepfolds of the Baiyinxile livestock farm to be 1.82 +/- 0.43 tons NO-N year(-1), which accounts to approximately 12.3% of the total NO emission from this steppe region. With the rapid increase of livestock numbers, sheepfold NO emissions may further increase and contribute to high N deposition in confined areas around sheepfolds. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Modified Method for Trapping and Analyzing 15N in NO Released from Soils. N-15 isotope tracing is an effective and direct approach to investigate sources of nitric oxide (NO) formed in soils. However, NO is highly reactive and rapidly converted to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the presence of ozone, making it impossible to directly measure N-15 in NO. Various wet-chemical methods for conversion of NO to nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) have been proposed for N-15 analysis in high-concentration NO sources, such as combustion processes. In contrast, NO concentrations in the soil surface-near air are usually small (ppbv-range), posing major challenges to conversion efficiency and blank correction. Here, we present a modified method in which NO is oxidized quantitatively to NO2 by chromium trioxide (CrO3), before conversion to NO2- and NO3- in an alkaline hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution. A denitrifier method was used to reduce NO2- and NO3- in the trapping solution quantitatively to nitrous oxide (N2O) for subsequent N-15 analysis. NO trapping efficiencies of >85% were obtained with 50 ppb NO in a 0.5 L min(-1) air stream bubbling through a solution of 1.2 M H2O2 and 0.5 M NaOH. In a laboratory test with distinct (NO)-N-15 abundances, the overall precision was 0.29 (d-values) for natural abundance NO and 0.13 atom % for labeled NO, suggesting that our method can be used for both natural abundance studies and N-15 labeling experiments. In a soil incubation experiment with (NH4NO3)-N-15, NH4(15)NO(3), or (NaNO2)-N-15 amendments, we found distinct N-15 abundances in NO, indicating that our method is well suited to investigate NO sources in soils.

The use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture produces significant quantities of nitrogenous gases including ammonia, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide. Through better farmland management practices, the emission of nitrogenous gases can be reduced while realizing clean water environment and climate-smart agriculture. In this article, we first provided an overview of the international movements on reducing nitrogenous gas emissions from farmlands. Then, we summarized the effect of agricultural management practices on nitrogen use efficiency for various crops, and evaluated their effect on nitrogenous gas emissions. The results indicated the importance of implementing site-specific sustainable management practices to enhance nitrogen use efficiency, and thus mitigate nitrogenous gas emissions. We also addressed the impact of agricultural activities on cropland nitrogen cycles, and highlighted the need to perform systematic trade-off evaluations with a well-defined scope to maximize environmental benefits and maintain ecosystem services. Lastly, we proposed three priority directions by moving toward a low-emission agriculture.

Annual net greenhouse gas balance in a halophyte (Helianthus tuberosus) bioenergy cropping system under various soil practices in Southeast China. A full accounting of net greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) was examined in an annual coastal reclaimed saline Jerusalem artichoke-fallow cropping system under various soil practices including soil tillage, soil ameliorant, and crop residue amendments. Seasonal fluxes of soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured using static chamber method, and the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was determined by the difference between soil heterotrophic respiration (R-H) and net primary production (NPP). Relative to no-tillage, rotary tillage significantly decreased the NPP of Jerusalem artichoke while it had no significant effects on the annual R-H. Rotary tillage increased CH4 emissions, while seasonal or annual soil N2O emissions did not statistically differ between the two tillage treatments. Compared with the control plots, soil ameliorant or straw amendment enhanced R-H, soil CH4, and N2O emissions under the both tillage regimes. Annual NGHGB was negative for all the field treatments, as a consequence of net ecosystem CO2 sequestration exceeding the CO2-equivalents released as CH4 and N2O emissions, which indicates that Jerusalem artichoke-fallow cropping system served as a net sink of GHGs. The annual net NGHGB and GHGI were estimated to be 11-21% and 4-8% lower in the NT than in RT cropping systems, respectively. Soil ameliorant and straw amendments greatly increased NPP and thus significantly decreased the negative annual net NGHGB. Overall, higher NPP but lower climatic impacts of coastal saline bioenergy production would be simultaneously achieved by Jerusalem artichoke cultivation under no-tillage with improved saline soil conditions in southeast China.

Invasion of Prosopis trees into arid ecosystem alters soil carbon and nitrogen processes and soil trace gases emissions. The invasion of drylands by leguminous mesquite (Prosopis spp.) is frequently associated with increases in the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. These increases stimulate soil microbial activity and accelerate soil C and N cycling. However, the impact of mesquite invasion on soil biogeochemistry, especially the emission of trace gases, in an ecosystem with an already established population of N-fixing plants is not well studied. To fill this knowledge gap, we quantified the in-situ soil trace gas emissions and the potential microbial activity in soils under invasive mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) trees (Prosopis), native acacia (Acacia tortilis) trees (Acacia), and in unvegetated soil between trees (Bare soil) on the western shore of the Dead Sea. To account for contributions of spatial and weather variabilities to the emission processes we conducted measurements across two geographic sites, 45 km apart, over two years, both under naturally dry soil conditions and after soil wetting. Before wetting, soil emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NOx) followed the order: Acacia > Prosopis >= Bare soil, while soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were low and uniform across the three habitats. The soil inorganic N concentration, microbial biomass, and water-extractable organic C were significantly higher under the A. tortilis canopies compared with P. juliflora and Bare soil. After wetting, soil trace gases emissions increased up to 66, 1534, and 42 times, for CO2, N2O, and NOx, respectively, and remained higher under the native A. tortilis than under P. juliflora and Bare soil (Acacia > Prosopis > Bare soil). The potential soil microbial activity, however, was similar between the soils under the tree canopies. Our results show that the establishment of invasive leguminous trees increase soil CO2 and gaseous N emissions relative to the Bare soils, but not relative to native leguminous trees.

Isotopic partitioning of gaseous nitrogen emissions of natural terrestrial ecosystems. We estimated the emissions of different forms of gaseous nitrogen (N) from natural terrestrial ecosystems using newly upscaled soil delta 15N maps, data-constrained gas partitioning models, and incorporating the previously missing N input flux from rock weathering. The emissions for nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and dinitrogen (N2) are estimated at 12 +/- 3, 19 +/- 4, and 12 +/- 3 Tg N yr-1, respectively. The Sixth Phase of Coupled Intercomparison Model Project (CMIP6) models tend to overestimate total gaseous N emissions and thus N2O emissions. Correcting these total gaseous N emissions to match soil delta 15N maps and applying gas partitioning models, the CMIP6 models' N2O emission estimates drop to 7 +/- 2 Tg N yr-1, consistent with this study and N2O Model Intercomparison Project 2. Differences in gas partitioning models also contribute significantly to uncertainties in N2O emission estimates. This study underscores the need for improved modeling of gaseous N emissions and partitioning in CMIP6 models to better understand the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change.

Quantifying the influence of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate on soil nitrous oxide production in multi-year reclaimed water-irrigated soil. 3,4-Dimethyl pyrazole phosphate (DMPP) is commonly used to regulate soil nitrogen transformation and mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, while reclaimed water (RW) irrigation alleviates freshwater shortages but may alter soil properties, affecting N2O emissions. However, the interaction between DMPP and RW irrigation on N2O emission pathways remains underexplored. This study conducted a field experiment with two water quality regimes (RW and groundwater (GW)) and two nitrogen fertilizer conditions (with and without DMPP) to assess soil N2O, nitric oxide (NO), and ammonia (NH3) emissions. Using the 1 5N tracing technique, we investigated microbial mechanisms underlying N2O and NO production under multi-year RW irrigation. The findings indicate that although DMPP effectively reduced soil N2O and NO concentrations within the 0-30 cm depth, thereby lowering their emissions under RW irrigation, its application also led to an increase in soil NH3 volatilization. Consequently, cumulative N2O emissions shifted from 2020 to 2021, with reductions of 15.11 %-38.46 % under RW irrigation and 36.88 %-48.29 % under GW irrigation. However, the inhibitory effect of DMPP was weaker under RW irrigation compared to GW irrigation. This reduction was influenced by RW irrigation, which enhanced the abundance of nitrifying microbial communities and increased the contribution of heterotrophic nitrification to soil N2O emissions, thereby mitigating the inhibitory effect of DMPP on autotrophic nitrification. Overall, it emphasized the need for optimized nitrogen management strategies under RW irrigation to maximize emission reductions while minimizing trade-offs in NH3 volatilization and microbial-driven nitrogen transformations.

Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Paddies: Understanding the Role of Rice Plants. Paddies are a potential source of anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. In paddies, both the soil and the rice plants emit N2O into the atmosphere. The rice plant in the paddy is considered to act as a channel between the soil and the atmosphere for N2O emission. However, recent studies suggest that plants can also produce N2O, while the mechanism of N2O formation in plants is unknown. Consequently, the rice plant is only regarded as a channel for N2O produced by soil microorganisms. The emission of N2O by aseptically grown plants and the distinct dual isotopocule fingerprint of plant-emitted N2O, as reported by various studies, support the production of N2O in plants. Herein, we propose a potential pathway of N2O formation in the rice plant. In rice plants, N2O might be formed in the mitochondria via the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide (NO3-NO2-NO) pathway when the cells experience hypoxic or anoxic stress. The pathway is catalyzed by various enzymes, which have been described. So, N2O emitted from paddies might have two origins, namely soil microorganisms and rice plants. So, regarding rice plants only as a medium to transport the microorganism-produced N2O might be misleading in understanding the role of rice plants in the paddy. As rice cultivation is a major agricultural activity worldwide, not understanding the pathway of N2O formation in rice plants would create more uncertainties in the N2O budget.

Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide fluxes differ from tea plantation and tropical forest soils after nitrogen addition. South Asia is experiencing a rapid increase in nitrogen (N) pollution which is predicted to continue in the future. One of the possible implications is an increase in gaseous reactive N losses from soil, notably in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Current knowledge of N2O and NO dynamics in forest ecosystems is not sufficient to understand and mitigate the impacts on climate and air quality. In order to improve the understanding of emissions from two major land uses in Sri Lanka, we investigated the emission potential for N2O and NO fluxes measured by absorption spectroscopy and chemiluminescence, respectively, in response to three different N addition levels (the equivalent of 0, 40 and 100 kg N ha-1 yr.-1 deposition in the form of NH4+) from soils of two typical land uses in Sri Lanka: a secondary montane tropical forest and a tea plantation using soil laboratory incubations of repacked soil cores. We observed an increase in NO fluxes which was directly proportional to the amount of N applied in line with initial expectations (maximum flux ranging from 6-8 ng NO-N g-1 d-1 and from 16-68 ng NO-N g-1 d-1 in forest and tea plantation soils, respectively). However, fluxes of N2O did not show a clear response to N addition, the highest treatment (100 N) did not result in the highest fluxes. Moreover, fluxes of N2O were higher following the addition of a source of carbon (in the form of glucose) across treatment levels and both land uses (maximum flux of 2-34 ng N2O-N g-1 d-1 in forest and 808-3,939 ng N2O-N g-1 d-1 in tea plantation soils). Both N2O and NO fluxes were higher from tea plantation soils compared to forest soils irrespective of treatment level, thus highlighting the importance of land use and land management for gaseous reactive N fluxes and therefore N dynamics.

Stimulating effects of snow cover on gaseous nitrogen emissions are intensified by biological soil crusts. Winter weather patterns are changing due to global climate change, which impacts the soil nitrogen cycle and greenhouse gas flux in these ecosystems, particularly the snow cover in temperate deserts. Biological soil crusts are important soil communities of the desert ecosystem and are sensitive to environmental changes. However, knowledge of the responses of gaseous nitrogen emissions from biological soil crusts to changes in snow cover is limited. In this study, the effects of snow cover on gaseous nitrogen emissions and the abundance of nitrifier (amoA) and denitrifier (narG, nirS, nirK, nosZ) genes were investigated in three snow cover treatments (snow removal, ambient snow, and increased snow depth). Snow cover significantly affected N2O and NO emissions from bare sand and biological soil crusts in winter. The abundance of denitrifier genes in bare sand and biological soil crusts and the abundance of nitrifier genes in moss crust increased with the depths of snow addition. N2O emissions increased with the successional stages of biological soil crusts during the winter. Both N2O and NO emissions from bare sand and biological soil crusts peaked in the freeze-thaw period (March) and were lowest in mid-winter (January). The emissions of N2O increased with increasing the abundance of amoA, nirK and nosZ genes. Our findings show that N2O emissions generally increased with increasing snow cover through their ef-fects on nitrogen cycle related functional microbial groups. These effects were regulated by the types of bio-logical soil crust, which can increase the effect of snow cover in winter.

Evidence for nitrogen saturation in the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California. Elevated N deposition has occurred in the Los Angeles Basin in southern California for at least the last 40 years. Elevated streamwater NO3- fluxes and high nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from soil, indicators of N saturation, have recently been reported for chaparral watersheds exposed to chronic N deposition in the San Gabriel Mountains north/northeast of Los Angeles. A number of nutritional and edaphic parameters across a deposition gradient in the San Bernardino Mountains (SBM) support the hypothesis that the mixed conifer forest in the western end of the range is also N saturated. Concentrations of NO3- in the soil solution or in soil extracts during the summer months were 14 to 44 times higher at Camp Paivika (CP), a western high N deposition site, than at Camp Osceola (CAO) or Barton Flats (BF), eastern low-pollution sites. Accumulation of NO3- in foliage of bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum var. pubescens Undenw.) and overstory species was also much greater at CP than at CAO and a site near BF. Nitric oxide fluxes in mid-August from relatively dry soil at CP were ca. 20 times higher than for typical forests in North America. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, on the other hand, were low in the SBM sites. However, emissions of NO and N2O were several-fold higher at CP than at BF, a relatively low-pollution site. High NO emissions from otherwise undisturbed and well-drained forest soils of the western US may prove useful as a diagnostic indicator of N saturation. Nitrogen mineralization was greater at CP and Dogwood (high-pollution sites) than at CAO and Heartbar (low-pollution sites), Additional indicators of N enrichment at CP compared with the low N deposition sites include: low C:N ratios in soil and foliage, high foliar N:P ratios, higher nitrification rates and high soil acidity. Lower pH and base saturation were observed in soil from two high-pollution sites compared with two low-pollution sites. In summary, high NO emissions and elevated NO; concentrations in the soil solution and in foliage, and high foliar N:P ratios at CP, indicate N in excess of biotic demand, with potential above-normal loss of N from the ecosystem - and thus, a N-saturated condition. Model outputs from the nutrient cycling model (NuCM) agreed well with field data from the SBM on elevated soil solution NO3- concentrations, reduced soil base saturation, and lack of a growth response to increasing N deposition.

Factors controlling regional differences in forest soil emission of nitrogen oxides (NO and N2O). Soil emissions of NO and N2O were measured continuously at high frequency for more than one year at 15 European forest sites as part of the EU-funded project NOFRETETE. The locations represent different forest types (coniferous/deciduous) and different nitrogen loads. Geoaphically they range from Finland in the north to Italy in the south and from Hungary in the east to Scotland in the west. The highest NO emissions were observed from coniferous forests, whereas the lowest NO emissions were observed from deciduous forests. The NO emissions from coniferous forests were highly correlated with N-deposition. The site with the highest average annual emission (82 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)) was a spruce forest in South-Germany (Hoglwald) receiving an annual N-deposition of 2.9 g m(-2). NO emissions close to the detection limit were observed from a pine forest in Finland where the N-deposition was 0.2 N m(-2) a(-1). No significant correlation between N2O emission and N-deposition was found. The highest average annual N2O emission (20 mu g N2O-Nm(-2) h(-1)) was found in an oak forest in the Matra mountains (Hungary) receiving an annual N-deposition of 1.6 g m(-2). N2O emission was significantly negatively correlated with the C/N ratio. The difference in N-oxide emissions from soils of coniferous and deciduous forests may partly be explained by differences in N-deposition rates and partly by differences in characteristics of the litter layer and soil. NO was mainly derived from nitrification whereas N2O was mainly derived from denitrification. In general, soil moisture is lower at coniferous sites (at least during spring time) and the litter layer of coniferous forests is thick and well aerated favouring nitrification and thus release of NO. Conversely, the higher rates of denitrification in deciduous forests due to a compact and moist litter layer lead to N2O production and NO consumption in the soil. The two factors soil moisture and soil temperature are often explaining most of the temporal variation within a site. When comparing annual emissions on a regional scale, however, factors such as nitrogen deposition and forest and soil type become much more important.

Measurement and modelling of NO fluxes on maize and wheat crops during their growing seasons: effect of crop management. Fertilized agricultural soils are a significant source of NO, a gas involved in tropospheric ozone formation. The aims of the research reported here were to measure NO fluxes over the length of the growing season of wheat and maize crops, and to build a model of soil NO emissions from arable land. Field experiments were carried out on a 1-ha field divided into two parts. The first one was cropped with wheat and harvested in late July, 2002, whereas the second part was sown with maize and harvested in October. The wheat and maize received 130 kg N ha(-1) and 140 kg N ha(-1), respectively. For each crop, NO fluxes were measured during 10 months every 2 weeks using manual closed chambers, and continuously with a wind tunnel immediately after nitrogen fertilization. Fertilizer application significantly affected NO emissions: the largest NO emissions were recorded a few days after nitrogen application. This delay depended on the kinetics of nitrogen incorporation in the soil, as influenced by rainfall. The emissions measured on the maize field (2.6% of the fertilizer amount applied) were more important than those on the wheat field (1.0% of the fertilizer amount applied), owing to differences in timing of nitrogen application, with respect to climate and crop growth. Relationships between soil nitrification rate and NO emission obtained from laboratory incubations, and experimental data appeared useful and relevant to predict NO emissions at the field-scale.

Effects of an experimental drought on soil emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and nitric oxide in a moist tropical forest. Changes in precipitation in the Amazon Basin resulting from regional deforestation, global warming, and El Nino events may affect emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) from soils. Changes in soil emissions of radiatively important gases could have feedback implications for regional and global climates. Here we report results of a large-scale (1 ha) throughfall exclusion experiment conducted in a mature evergreen forest near Santarem, Brazil. The exclusion manipulation lowered annual N2O emissions by >40% and increased rates of consumption of atmospheric CH4 by a factor of >4. No treatment effect has yet been detected for NO and CO2 fluxes. The responses of these microbial processes after three rainy seasons of the exclusion treatment are characteristic of a direct effect of soil aeration on denitrification, methanogenesis, and methanotrophy. An anticipated second phase response, in which drought-induced plant mortality is followed by increased mineralization of C and N substrates from dead fine roots and by increased foraging of termites on dead coarse roots, has not yet been detected. Analyses of depth profiles of N2O and CO2 concentrations with a diffusivity model revealed that the top 25 cm soil is the site of most of the wet season production of N2O, whereas significant CO2 production occurs down to 100 cm in both seasons, and small production of CO2 occurs to at least 1100 cm depth. The diffusivity-based estimates of CO2 production as a function of depth were strongly correlated with fine root biomass, indicating that trends in belowground C allocation may be inferred from monitoring and modeling profiles of H2O and CO2.

Short-lived isotopic method to measure nitrous oxide emissions from a soil under four low-fertility management systems. Aerobic production of N(2)O and N(2) from denitrification in four low-fertility ecosystems was measured using the short-lived radioisotope (13)N. The ecosystems, comprising two pastures, native beech (Nothofagus truncata) forest and exotic pine (Pinus radiata) forest, all had the same soil and the same slope and aspect. There was no consistent seasonal pattern of emissions, although the soils were dry on all three occasions (summer, autumn and spring) that samples were taken. Emission rates and N(2)O-to-N(2) ratios were generally highest in the surface 0-2 cm in the pasture soils, but not as frequently in the forest soils. Some of the forest soil samples produced a third gas, tentatively identified as NO. Emissions of N(2)O, but not of N(2), appeared to be generally greater from the forest than from the pasture sites, although only a limited number of samples were studied. Nitrate-N concentrations were generally low (ranging from 0.36 to 57.4 mg kg(-1), mean 3.27 mg kg(-1)) in these samples. Production of N(2)O, estimated from the relativity between (13)NO(3)(-)-N added and NO(3)(-)-N present in the soil, placed these ecosystems at the lower end of emission rates for undisturbed ecosystems, with rates ranging from 0.02 to 6.38 ng N(2)O-N g(-1) soil h(-1) (mean 0.65 ng N(2)O-N g(-1) soil h(-1)).

Organically fertilized tea plantation stimulates N2O emissions and lowers NO fluxes in subtropical China. Tea plantations are rapidly expanding in China and other countries in the tropical and subtropical zones, but so far there are very few studies including direct measurements of nitrogenous gas fluxes from tea plantations. On the basis of 2-year field measurements from 2012 to 2014, we provided an insight into the assessment of annual nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from Chinese subtropical tea plantations under three practices of conventional urea application, alternative oilcake incorporation and no nitrogen fertilization. Clearly, the N2O and NO fluxes exhibited large intra-and inter-annual variations, and furthermore, their temporal variability could be well described by a combination of soil environmental factors including soil mineral N, water-filled pore space and temperature, based on a revised \"hole-in-the-pipe\" model. Averaged over a 2-year study, annual background N2O and NO emissions were approximately 4.0 and 1.6 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Compared to no nitrogen fertilization, both urea and oilcake application significantly stimulated annual N2O and NO emissions, amounting to 14.4-32.7 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and at least 12.3-19.4 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In comparison with conventional urea treatment, on average, the application of organic fertilizer significantly increased N2O emission by 71% but decreased NO emission by 22 %. Although the magnitude of N2O and NO fluxes was substantially influenced by the source of N, the annual direct emission factors of N fertilizer were estimated to be 2.8-5.9, 2.7-4.0 and 6.8-9.1% for N2O, NO and N2O+NO, respectively, which are significantly higher than those defaults for global upland croplands. This indicated that the rarely determined N2O and NO formation appeared to be a significant pathway in the nitrogen cycle of tea plantations, which are a potential source of national nitrogenous gases inventory.

Effect of low C/N crop residue input on N2O, NO, and CH4 fluxes from Andosol and Fluvisol fields. Crop residues are produced from agriculture in large amounts globally. Crop residues arc known to be a source of nitrous oxide (N2O); however, contrasting results have been reported. Furthermore, the effect of crop residues on nitric oxide (NO) and methane (CH4) fluxes has not been well studied. We investigated N2O, NO, and CH4 fluxes after low C/N crop residue (cabbages and potatoes) inputs to lysi meter fields for two years using with automated flux monitoring system. Lysimeters were filled with two contrasting soil types, Andosol (total C: 33.1 g kg(-1); clay: 18%) and Fluvisol (17.7 g kg(-1); 36%). Nitrogen application rates were 250 kg N ha(-1) of synthetic fertilizer and 272 kg N ha(-1) of cow manure compost for cabbage, and 120 kg N ha(-1) of synthetic fertilizer and 136 kg N ha(-1) of cow manure compost for potato, respectively. Large N2O peaks were observed after crop residues were left on the surface of the soil for 1 to 2 weeks in summer, but not in winter. The annual N2O emission factors (EFs) for cabbage residues were 3.02% and 537% for Andosol and Fluvisol, respectively. Those for potatoes were 751% and 5.10% for Andosol and Fluvisol, respectively. The EFs were much higher than the mean EFs of synthetic fertilizers from Japan's agricultural fields (0.62%). Moreover, the EFs were much higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default N2O EFs for synthetic fertilizers and crop residues (1%). The annual NO EFs for potatoes were 1.35% and 2,44% for Andosol and Fluvisol, respectively, while no emission was observed after cabbage residue input. Crop residues did not affect CH4 uptake by soil. Our results suggest that low C/N crop residue input to soils can create a hotspot of N2O emission, when temperature and water conditions are not limiting factors for microbial activity.

Combination of drip irrigation and organic fertilizer for mitigating emissions of nitrogen oxides in semiarid climate. Fertilizer and irrigation management are two of the most important factors which directly influence nitrification and denitrification processes from agricultural soils and, therefore, emissions of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and nitric oxide (NO). To date, the effect of combining organic fertilizer (applied before planting) with a drip irrigation system (DI) on the emissions of these nitrogen (N) oxides has not been evaluated. The different distribution and amount of water applied with this irrigation system should produce less favourable conditions for denitrification than other irrigation systems, such as furrow irrigation (FI), and this could be used to mitigate emissions of N(2)O, especially following organic fertilizer application. In order to test this hypothesis, a field experiment was carried out to compare the influence of FI and DI on N(2)O and NO emissions using digested pig slurry (DPS) as organic fertilizer during a melon crop (Cucumis melo L cv. Sancho) season. Plots without any N fertilizer were used as a control (control). The irrigation system influenced the water distribution pattern, producing significantly higher ammonium-N (NH(4)(+)-N) and nitrate-N (NO(3)(-)-N) concentrations in the soil under DI than under FI. Moreover, the differences observed in water filled pore space (WFPS) and mineral N also favoured a different pattern of emissions of N oxides. Only one large pulse of N(2)O (106.9 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and NO (0.81 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) were observed for FI after the first irrigation event while several pulses were observed for DI during the entire experimental period. As a consequence, nitrous oxide emissions were 75% and 28% lower from control and DPS, respectively under DI than under FI. In contrast, NO emissions were higher for DI on some sampling dates in both treatments, but without significant differences in the cumulative NO emissions between both irrigation systems. In conclusion, this work shows that combining drip irrigation with organic fertilizer for horticultural crops in semiarid climates could be a good management strategy for three reasons: it saves water: it re-uses organic residues and it mitigates N(2)O emissions.

Spatial variations of nitrogen trace gas emissions from tropical mountain forests in Nyungwe, Rwanda. Globally, tropical forest soils represent the second largest source of N2O and NO. However, there is still considerable uncertainty on the spatial variability and soil properties controlling N trace gas emission. Therefore, we carried out an incubation experiment with soils from 31 locations in the Nyungwe tropical mountain forest in southwestern Rwanda. All soils were incubated at three different moisture levels (50, 70 and 90 % water filled pore space (WFPS)) at 17 A degrees C. Nitrous oxide emission varied between 4.5 and 400 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), while NO emission varied from 6.6 to 265 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Mean N2O emission at different moisture levels was 46.5 +/- 11.1 (50 %WFPS), 71.7 +/- 11.5 (70 %WFPS) and 98.8 +/- 16.4 (90 %WFPS) mu g N m(-2) h(-1), while mean NO emission was 69.3 +/- 9.3 (50 %WFPS), 47.1 +/- 5.8 (70 %WFPS) and 36.1 +/- 4.2 (90 %WFPS) mu g N m(-2) h(-1). The latter suggests that climate (i.e. dry vs. wet season) controls N2O and NO emissions. Positive correlations with soil carbon and nitrogen indicate a biological control over N2O and NO production. But interestingly N2O and NO emissions also showed a positive correlation with free iron and a negative correlation with soil pH (only N2O). The latter suggest that chemo-denitrification might, at least for N2O, be an important production pathway. In conclusion improved understanding and process based modeling of N trace gas emission from tropical forests will benefit from spatially explicit trace gas emission estimates linked to basic soil property data and differentiating between biological and chemical pathways for N trace gas formation.

Surface exchange of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone at a cattle pasture in Rondonia, Brazil - art. no. 8083. Measurements of NO-NO2-O-3 trace gas exchange were performed for two transition season periods during the La Nina a year 1999 (30 April to 17 May, \"wet-dry,\" and 24 September to 27 October, \"dry-wet\") over a cattle pasture in Rondonia. A dynamic chamber system (applied during the dry-wet season) was used to directly measure emission fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) and surface resistances for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) deposition. A companion study was simultaneously performed in an old-growth forest. In order to determine ecosystem-representative NO2 and O-3 deposition fluxes for both measurement periods, an inferential method (multiresistance model) was applied to measure ambient NO2 and O-3 concentrations using observed quantities of turbulent transport. Supplementary measurements included soil NO diffusivity and soil nutrient analysis. The observed NO soil emission fluxes were nine times lower than old-growth rain forest emissions under similar soil moisture and temperature conditions and were attributed to the combination of a reduced soil N cycle and lower effective soil NO diffusion at the pasture. Canopy resistances (R-c) of both gases controlled the deposition processes during the day for both measurement periods. Day and night NO2 canopy resistances were significantly similar (alpha = 0.05) during the dry-wet period. Ozone canopy resistances revealed significantly higher daytime resistances of 106 s m(-1) versus 65 s m(-1) at night because of plant, soil, and wet skin uptake processes, enhanced by stomatal activity at night and aqueous phase chemistry on vegetative and soil surfaces. The surface of the pasture was a net NOx sink during 1999, removing seven times more NO2 from the atmosphere than was emitted as NO. C1 IPEN CNEN SP, Div Quim Ambienta, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

FIELD-STUDY OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES CONTROLLING THE NO EMISSIONS FROM SOIL AND THE NO COMPENSATION POINT. The NO flux rates were measured on a sandy loam at Haxthauser Hof near Mainz in summer 1983. Significant emissions of NO(y) species other than NO were also occasionally measured. The data show that the NO and NO(y) emission rates are dependent on soil temperature, soil moisture, soil porosity, fertilization, plant cover, soil organic matter content, and NO and NO(y) mixing ratios in ambient air. Generally, one of these variables dominated and masked the influence of the others. In some cases the soil treatment led to the replacement of one dominating controlling factor by another one. In most cases, NO and NO(y) emission was observed at low, and deposition at high, mixing ratios of NO and NO(y) in the ambient air. The compensation points, i.e., the mixing ratios at which the flux from the soil is zero, varied between 0-5.5 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) for NO and 0-16.3 ppbv for NO(y) depending on the plant cover, soil temperature, soil organic matter content, and fertilization. Because the compensation points are of the same order of magnitude as the NO and NO(y) mixing ratios in ambient air, knowledge of the variables controlling them is essential for creditable estimations of the global NO(x) emissions by soils. ", "Nitric oxide emission response to soil moisture is linked to transcriptional activity of functional microbial groups. Nitric oxide emission response to soil moisture is linked to transcriptional activity of functional microbial groups. Numerous studies have shown that soil moisture controls NO flux from soils. Less is known, however, to what extent microbial N-cycling mediates this control. Does soil moisture control NO release primarily by affecting the physical gas exchange between soil and atmosphere, by modulating microbial activities involved in biotic NO turnover, or by both? Using a novel dynamic chamber system for high-resolution measurement of NO release, we found one or several soil-specific maxima of NO release during dry-out experiments in different soils. A mid-latitude arable soil displayed a single maximum at 0.10 water holding capacity (whc), whereas a dryland farming and a rice paddy soil showed two maxima at 0.65/0.10 and 0.90/0.10 whc, respectively. Transcription of nirS genes in the dryland soil at 0.65 whc was low, but larger than at 0.10 whc, while transcriptional activity of archaeal ammonia oxidizers showed the opposite pattern with higher activity at 0.10 whc, suggesting biogenic NO production at low soil moisture. Our study is a first attempt to link NO emission to soil moisture responses of different microbial groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nitrogen soil emissions and belowground plant processes in Mediterranean annual pastures are altered by ozone exposure and N-inputs. Increasing tropospheric ozone (O-3) and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition alter the structure and composition of pastures. These changes could affect N and C compounds in the soil that in turn can influence soil microbial activity and processes involved in the emission of N oxides, methane (CH4) and carbon dioidde (CO2), but these effects have been scarcely studied. Through an open top chamber (OTC) field experiment, the combined effects of both pollutants on soil gas emissions from an annual experimental Mediterranean community were assessed. Four O-3 treatments and three different N input levels were considered. Fluxes of nitric (NO) and nitrous (N2O) oxide, CH4 and CO2 were analysed as well as soil mineral N and dissolved organic carbon. Belowground plant parameters like root biomass and root C and N content were also sampled. Ozone strongly increased soil N2O emissions, doubling the cumulative emission through the growing cycle in the highest O-3 treatment, while N-inputs enhanced more slightly NO; CH4 and CO2 where not affected. Both N-gases had a clear seasonality, peaking at the start and at the end of the season when pasture physiological activity is minimal; thus, higher microorganism activity occurred when pasture had a low nutrient demand. The O-3-induced peak of N2O under low N availability at the end of the growing season was counterbalanced by the high N inputs. These effects were related to the O-3 x N significant interaction found for the root-N content in the grass and the enhanced senescence of the community. Results indicate the importance of the belowground processes, where competition between plants and microorganisms for the available soil N is a key factor, for understanding the ecosystem responses to O-3 and N.

Emissions of N2O and NO associated with nitrogen fertilization in intensive agriculture, and the potential for mitigation. Increases in the atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) contribute to global warming and to ozone depletion in the stratosphere Nitric oxide (NO) is a cause of acid rain and tropospheric ozone. The use of N fertilizers in agriculture has direct and indirect effects an the emissions of both these gases, which are the result of microbial nitrification and denitrification in the soil, and which are controlled principally by soil water and mineral N contents, temperature and labile organic matter The global emission of N2O from cultivated land is now estimated at 3.5 Tg N annually of which 1.5 Tg has been directly attributed ro synthetic N fertilizers, out of a total quantity applied in 1990 of about 77 Tg N. This amount was 150% above the 1970 figure. The total fertilizer-induced emissions of NO are somewhere in the range 0.5-5 Tg N. Mineral N fertilizers can also be indirect as well as direct sources of N2O and NO emissions, via deposition of volatilized NH3 on natural ecosystems and denitrification of leached nitrate in subsoils, waters and sediments. IPCC currently assume an N2O emission factor of 1.25 +/- 1.0% of fertilizer N applied. No allowance is made for different fertilizer types, on the basis that soil management and cropping systems, and unpredictable rainfall inputs, are more important variables. However, recent results show substantial reductions in emissions from grassland by matching fertilizer type to environmental conditions, and in arable systems by using controlled release fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors, Also better timing and placement of N, application of the minimum amount of N to achieve satisfactory yield, and optimization of soil physical conditions, particularly avoidance of excessive wetness and compaction, would be expected to reduce the average emission factor for N2O. Some of these adjustments would also reduce NO emissions. However, increasing global fertilizer use is likely to cause an upward trend in total emissions even if these mitigating practices become widely adopted.

Soil N2O and NO emissions from an arid, urban ecosystem. We measured soil nitrogen (N) cycling and fluxes of N2O and NO in three land-use types across the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona. Urbanization increased N2O emissions compared to native landscapes, primarily due to the expansion of fertilized and irrigated lawns. Fluxes of N2O from lawns ranged from 18 to 80 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) and were significantly larger than managed xeric landscapes (2.5-22 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and remnant desert sites within the urban core (3.7-14 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). In contrast, average NO fluxes from lawns were not significantly different from native desert when dry (6-80 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) lawn; 5-16 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) desert) and were lower than fluxes from deserts after wetting events. Furthermore, urbanization has significantly altered the temporal dynamics of NO emissions by replacing pulse-driven desert ecosystems with year-round irrigated, managed lawns. Short-term, pulse-driven emissions of NO from wetting of dry desert soils may reach 35% of anthropogenic emissions within a day after summer monsoon storms. If regional O-3 production is NOx-limited during the monsoon season, fluxes from warm, recently wet arid soils may contribute to summer O-3 episodes.

Spatial variation of nitrous oxide emission between interrow soil and interrow plus row soil in a long-term maize cultivated sandy loam soil. There is a high spatial variation in N2O emission from agricultural fields and N2O emissions from fields cultivated with stalk-crops was generally measured in the interrow area. The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in seasonal N2O emissions between interrow soil and interrow + row soil, and to understand the effect of different fertilizers on N2O emissions in a maize-cultivated sandy loam soil in the North China Plain. The experiment included five treatments: organic manure (OM), half-organic manure N plus half fertilizer N (HOM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NK (NK) and control (CK). Cumulative N2O emission from interrow + row soil during the maize growth season was 0.84-122 kg N ha(-1) with an average of 0.98 kg N ha(-1) in the N-fertilized treatments, significantly higher than the 0.30-0.49 kg N ha(-1) from interrow soil. However, no significant difference was observed in the CK treatment. The measurement in interrow soil underestimated N2O emissions by 44-67%. This difference mainly occurred at the two peak emission periods following fertilizer application probably due to discrepancy in soil denitrification potential. Manure application more efficiently increased difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil than inorganic N fertilizer application. The higher NO concentration did not induce larger N2O emission from interrow soil in the NK treatment than in the NPK treatment, but did from interrow + row soil, resulting in greater difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil. It is suggested that measuring N2O emission solely from interrow soil could underestimate seasonal N2O emissions, and partly mask the effect of N fertilizer application rates on N2O emission in a maize-cultivated soil in the North China Plain.

Biogenic nitrogen oxide emissions from soils -: impact on NOx and ozone over West Africa during AMMA (African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Experiment):: modelling study. Nitrogen oxide biogenic emissions from soils are driven by soil and environmental parameters. The relationship between these parameters and NO fluxes is highly non linear. A new algorithm, based on a neural network calculation, is used to reproduce the NO biogenic emissions linked to precipitations in the Sahel on the 6 August 2006 during the AMMA campaign. This algorithm has been coupled in the surface scheme of a coupled chemistry dynamics model (MesoNH Chemistry) to estimate the impact of the NO emissions on NOx and O-3 formation in the lower troposphere for this particular episode. Four different simulations on the same domain and at the same period are compared: one with anthropogenic emissions only, one with soil NO emissions from a static inventory, at low time and space resolution, one with NO emissions from neural network, and one with NO from neural network plus lightning NOx. The influence of NOx from lightning is limited to the upper troposphere. The NO emission from soils calculated with neural network responds to changes in soil moisture giving enhanced emissions over the wetted soil, as observed by aircraft measurements after the passing of a convective system. The subsequent enhancement of NOx and ozone is limited to the lowest layers of the atmosphere in modelling, whereas measurements show higher concentrations above 1000 m. The neural network algorithm, applied in the Sahel region for one particular day of the wet season, allows an immediate response of fluxes to environmental parameters, unlike static emission inventories. Stewart et al (2008) is a companion paper to this one which looks at NOx and ozone concentrations in the boundary layer as measured on a research aircraft, examines how they vary with respect to the soil moisture, as indicated by surface temperature anomalies, and deduces NOx fluxes. In this current paper the model-derived results are compared to the observations and calculated fluxes presented by Stewart et al (2008).

Impacts of land management on fluxes of trace greenhouse gases. Land use change and land management practices affect the net emissions of the trace gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon sources and sinks. Changes in CH4 and N2O emissions can substantially alter the overall greenhouse gas balance of a system. Drainage of peatlands for agriculture or forestry generally increases N2O emission as well as that of CO2, but also decreases CH4 emission. Intermittent drainage. or late flooding of rice paddies can greatly diminish the seasonal emission of CH4 compared with continuous flooding. Changes in N2O emissions following land use change from forest or grassland to agriculture vary between climatic zones, and the net impact varies with time. In many soils, the increase in carbon sequestration by adopting no-till systems may be largely negated by associated increases in N2O emission. The promotion of carbon credits for the no-till system before we have better quantification of its net greenhouse gas balance is naive. Applying nitrogen fertilizers to forests could increase the forest carbon sink, but may be accompanied by a net increase in N2O; conversely, adding lime to acid forest soils can decrease the N2O emission.

Modeling impacts of fertilization alternatives on nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from conventional vegetable fields in southeastern China. Intensive nitrogen (N) fertilizer application in the vegetable fields of China has commonly occurred during recent decades and may substantially increase both nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. However, the quantification of N2O and NO emissions from vegetable fields has been rare due to both the lack of long-term field measurements and reliable methods for extrapolating these measurements. Using a unique dataset from a four-year measurement study of an intensively managed conventional vegetable field in southeastern China, we tested a process-based biogeochemical model, denitrification-decomposition (DNDC), for its applicability for quantifying the impact of fertilizer management practices on emissions of N trace gases from vegetable production. The results from the model validation indicate that the simulations of vegetable yields and seasonal cumulative N2O and NO emissions are consistent with the observations. In addition, DNDC can generally capture the measured temporal pattern of daily N2O and NO fluxes. The modeled impacts of fertilization alternatives can be summarized as follows: (a) both the type and application rate of N fertilizers play important roles in regulating N2O and NO emissions as well as vegetable growth; (b) reducing the N application rate to 75% of the conventional amount decreased N2O and NO emissions by 31% and showed little impact on vegetable biornasses, suggesting that reducing the N dose to a reasonable level would be advisable for both the mitigation of N gases emissions and the maintenance of vegetable production; and (c) replacing synthetic fertilizer under the conventional management practices with organic manure may significantly stimulate N2O emission by 62% while decreasing vegetable yields. The results from this modeling study may provide useful information for the ongoing debate regarding the optimization of fertilizer use strategies in China. This study also demonstrates the potential of utilizing process-based models, such as DNDC, to quantify and mitigate N2O and NO emissions from intensive vegetable production through interpreting, integrating, and extrapolating field observations.

Impact of salinity gradients on nitric oxide emissions and functional microbes in estuarine wetland sediments. Estuarine wetland sediments are hotspots for nitrogen cycling and critical sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO). Yet studies on the impact of sediment salinity gradients on NO emissions and associated functional microbes at the land-ocean interface remain limited. Here, we measured sediment NO emission rates from incubated sediment samples that were collected from an estuarine wetland in Qingdao, China. Our findings indicate that sediment salinity is a pivotal factor shaping NO emission rates, by altering the community composition and gene abundance of functional microbes involved in NO emissions, with rates ranging from 0.04 to 0.25 mu g N kg-1 dry soil h-1. Metagenomic analysis of the sediment samples reveals that greater NO emission rates (+486 %) under salinity changes are linked to a higher abundance of the nirS gene (+26 %) responsible for NO formation and a lower abundance of norBC genes (-23 %) responsible for NO consumption. Accordingly, the increase of NO emissions may be attributed to the accumulation of denitrifying NO, which could improve plant salt tolerance through co-evolutionary interactions between plants and sediment-dwelling microbes. Taken together, these findings contribute to a richer understanding of how biochemical NO emissions in estuarine wetland sediments respond to salinity gradients.

The contributions of hydroxylamine and nitrite to NO and N2O production in alkaline and acidic vegetable soils. Purpose The contribution of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and nitrite (NO2-) to nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) production remains unclear in vegetable production soils. Materials and methods Soils collected from six typical greenhouse vegetable fields were incubated for 48 h following amendment with 1 mM NaNO2, 10 mu M NH2OH, or 1 mM NaNO2 + 10 mu M NH2OH. The importance of abiotic processes on the NO and N2O formation from the NH2OH and NO2- were studied by irradiating the soil samples with gamma-irradiation. Results and discussion NO2- amendment significantly stimulated NO production, while the NH2OH-dependent NO production was minimal. NH2OH stimulated more abiotic N2O production in alkaline soils than in acidic soils (p < 0.05), while NO2- stimulated more biotic N2O production in acidic soils than in alkaline soils (p < 0.05). The NH2OH- and NO2--dependent sources produced biotic or abiotic N2O with site preference (SP) values of 27.4-36.5 parts per thousand, which is similar to those from ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) or ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) sources (25.1-34.2 parts per thousand), indicating that abiotic N2O production were closely linked with biotic NH3 oxidation. The variability of NO2-+NH2OH-induced N2O production can be explained by the soil organic carbon and iron concentrations, whereas NO2--induced NO production can be explained by the soil pH. Conclusions NO2- addition dominated NO production in all soils. Furthermore, NO2- addition increased biotic N2O production in acidic soils, while NH2OH addition increased abiotic N2O production in alkaline soils. The presence of NO2- could significantly stimulate the abiotic conversion of NH2OH to N2O in soils with low soil organic carbon and high iron concentrations. Thus, assessing the abundance of NH2OH and NO2- could provide crucial information for understanding NO and N2O production procedures in vegetable soils.

Global inventory of NOx sources. Nitrogen oxides are key compounds for the oxidation capacity of the troposphere. NO, concentrations depend on the proximity of sources because of their short atmospheric lifetime. An accurate knowledge of the distribution of their sources and sinks is therefore crucial. At global scale, the dominant sources of nitrogen oxides - combustions of fossil fuel (similar to 50%) and biomass burning (similar to 20%) - are basically anthropogenic. Natural sources, including lightning and microbial activity in soils, represent therefore less than 30% of total emissions. Fertilizer use in agriculture constitutes an anthropogenic perturbation to the microbial source. The methods to estimate the magnitude and distribution of these dominant sources of nitrogen oxides are discussed. Some minor sources which may play a specific role in tropospheric chemistry such as NOx emission from aircraft in the upper troposphere or input from production in the stratosphere from N2O photodissociation are also considered. emission mechanisms; inventory; nitrogen oxides; sources", "Nitrogen deposition stimulated winter nitrous oxide emissions from bare sand more than biological soil crusts in cold desert ecosystem. Nitrogen deposition stimulated winter nitrous oxide emissions from bare sand more than biological soil crusts in cold desert ecosystem. Dryland ecosystems are often nitrogen-limited, and small nitrogen inputs may produce large responses to dryland ecological processes, such as gaseous nitrogen emission. The effect of increased anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on N2O and NO emissions in desert ecosystems is unclear, especially in non-growing seasons when the surface is covered with snow. In this study, nitrogen applications were performed on biological soil crusts (lichen crust and moss crust, bare sand for control) in the Gurbantunggut Desert, Northwest China. We measured the fluxes of N2O and NO and related nitrogen cycle functional gene abundances in winter for three-years period. Nitrogen addition significantly affected N2O emissions and increased the abundances of key functional gene for nitrogen cycle, while it only slightly influenced NO emissions. These effects of nitrogen addition depended on composition of biological soil crusts. For bare sand and lichen crust, nitrogen addition significantly increased N2O emissions, whereas for moss crust, only a negligible effect was observed. Meanwhile, significant differences in nitrogen cycle functional gene abundances were found among different composition of biological soil crusts. Abundance of amoA, narG, and nosZ genes were highly related to N2O and NO emissions. Thus, our results indicate that gaseous nitrogen emissions were generally increased by nitrogen addition through their effects on related functional microbial groups. The effects were regulated by composition of biological soil crusts which can buffer the effects of increasing nitrogen addition during winter.

Reducing N2O and NO emissions while sustaining crop productivity in a Chinese vegetable-cereal double cropping system. High nitrogen (N) inputs in Chinese vegetable and cereal productions played key roles in increasing crop yields. However, emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO) increased too. For lowering the environmental costs of crop production, it is essential to optimize N strategies to maintain high crop productivity, while reducing the associated N losses. We performed a 2 year-round field study regarding the effect of different combinations of poultry manure and chemical N fertilizers on crop yields, N use efficiency (NUE) and N2O and NO fluxes from a Welsh onion-winter wheat system in the North China Plain. Annual N2O and NO emissions averaged 1.14-3.82 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 5.54-13.06 g N kg(-1) N uptake) and 0.57-1.87 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 2.78-6.38 g N kg(-1) N uptake) over all treatments, respectively. Both N2O and NO emissions increased linearly with increasing total N inputs, and the mean annual direct emission factors (EFd) were 0.39% for N2O and 0.19% for NO. Interestingly, the EFd for chemical N fertilizers (N2O: 0.42-0.48%; NO: 0.07-0.11%) was significantly lower than for manure N (N2O: 1.35%; NO: 0.76%). Besides, a negative power relationship between yield-scaled N2O, NO or N2O + NO emissions and NUE was observed, suggesting that improving NUE in crop production is crucial for increasing crop yields while decreasing nitrogenous gas release. Compared to the current farmers' fertilization rate, alternative practices with reduced chemical N fertilizers increased NUE and decreased annual N2O + NO emissions substantially, while crop yields remained unaffected. As a result, annual yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions were reduced by > 20%. Our study shows that a reduction of current application rates of chemical N fertilizers by 30-50% does not affect crop productivity, while at the same time N2O and NO emissions would be reduced significantly.

NH3, N2O, NO and NO2 losses, emission factors and reduction mechanisms under different N managements from greenhouse vegetable soils. Excessive nitrogen (N) application in greenhouse cultivation has led to substantial reactive N (Nr) emissions from soils, necessitating effective mitigation strategies. This study presents simultaneous high-frequency monitoring of ammonia (NH3) volatilization, nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions across three greenhouse vegetable seasons (tomato, cabbage and lettuce) under different N management regimes. Key findings reveal that emission factors of NH3, N2O, NO, and NO2 were 0.6 %, 1.6 %, 0.8 % and 0.2 % in greenhouse vegetable systems, respectively. Among the emitted annual Nr gases (8.2-72.0 kg N.ha-1), N2O emissions accounted for the highest proportion of total Nr gas losses. Controlled-release N with organic fertilizer emerged as the most effective strategy, significantly reducing total Nr gas emissions while maintaining high vegetable yield. This reduction was mechanistically linked to suppressed urease activity and decreased expression of key microbial genes (amoA, hao, nirK and norB). N application rate, fertilizer type, soil moisture and temperature were identified as the primary drivers of Nr gas emissions. This study firstly provided crucial empirical emission factors and proportions for NH3, N2O, NO and NO2 gases, offering a technical pathway for synergistically reducing pollution and carbon emissions in greenhouse vegetable cultivation.

Rhizobium etli is able to emit nitrous oxide by connecting assimilatory nitrate reduction with nitrite respiration in the bacteroids of common bean nodules. Legumes can contribute to emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) directly by some rhizobia species that are able to denitrify under free-living conditions and in symbiotic association with the plant. In this study, the capacity of Phaseolus vulgaris-Rhizobium etli symbiosis to emit N2O in response to nitrate (NO3 (-)) has been demonstrated for the first time. We found that bacteroidal assimilatory nitrate reductase (NarB) as well as nitrite reductase (NirK) and nitric oxide reductase (cNor) denitrifying enzymes contribute to nitric oxide (NO) and N2O formation in nodules. We also show that R. etli NarK is involved in NO2 (- )extrusion and links NO3 - reduction by NarB in the cytoplasm with NirK and cNor denitrification activities in the periplasm. The knowledge generated in this work will be instrumental for exploring strategies and sustainable practices in agricultural soil management to increase legume crop yield and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

Effects of environmental factors on temporal variation in annual carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions from an unfertilized bare field on Gray Lowland soil in Mikasa, Hokkaido, Japan. Soil is an important source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Studies of CO2 and N2O emissions from bare soil may explain annual changes in carbon (C) in soil organic matter (SOM) and help analyze N2O production from SOM. Therefore, CO2 and N2O emissions associated with the decomposition of SOM from bare soil are important factors for assessing the C budget and N2O emission in agricultural fields. We conducted a study over 7 years to assess the controlling factors of CO2 and N2O emissions from unplanted and unfertilized soil in Mikasa, Hokkaido, Japan. The CO2 flux increased in summer and there were significant positive correlations between the CO2 flux and soil temperature in the first 4 years. However, apparent relationships between CO2 flux and water-filled pore space, soil NH4 and NO3 concentrations were not observed. The slope of monthly CO2 emission against mean monthly temperature was positively correlated with monthly precipitation. These results suggest that the response of CO2 production to increases in soil temperature became more sensitive in wet soils. The average CO2 emission during the study period was 2.53 Mg C ha-1 year-1, and uncertainty in the annual CO2 emission was 24%. Annual precipitation explained the yearly variation (CO2 emission [Mg C ha-1 year-1] = 0.0021 x annual precipitation [mm year-1] -0.0499, R = 0.976, P < 0.001). Nitrous oxide flux increased from July to October and was positively correlated with CO2 flux. Based on the ratio of N2O-N : NO-N of fluxes, N2O appeared to be the main product of denitrification. The average N2O emission over the study period was 4.88 kg N ha-1 year-1, and uncertainty in the annual N2O emission was 58.5%. Strong relationships between the monthly emissions of CO2 and N2O suggest that N2O production by denitrification is strongly affected by SOM decomposition. Unlike CO2 emission, a relationship between N2O emission and precipitation was not observed because of the multiple pathways of nitrification and denitrification for N2O production induced by SOM decomposition.

Effect of biochar and nitrapyrin on nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from a sandy loam soil cropped to maize. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the combined or individual effects of biochar and nitrapyrin (a nitrification inhibitor) on N2O and NO emissions from a sandy loam soil cropped to maize. The study included nine treatments: addition of urea alone or combined with nitrapyrin to soils that had been amended with biochar at 0, 3, 6, and 12 t ha(-1) in the preceding year, and a control without the addition of N fertilizer. Peaks in N2O and NO flux occurred simultaneously following fertilizer application and intense rainfall events, and the peak of NO flux was much higher than that of N2O following application of basal fertilizer. Mean emission ratios of NO/N2O ranged from 1.11 to 1.72, suggesting that N2O was primarily derived from nitrification. Cumulative N2O and NO emissions were 1.00 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 1.39 kg NO-N ha(-1) in the N treatment, respectively, decreasing to 0.81-0.85 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 1.31-1.35 kg NO-N ha(-1) in the biochar amended soils, respectively, while there was no significant difference among the treatments. NO emissions were significantly lower in the nitrapyrin treatments than in the N fertilization-alone treatments (P < 0.05), but there was no effect on N2O emissions. Neither biochar nor nitrapyrin amendment affected maize yield or N uptake. Overall, our results showed that biochar amendment in the preceding year had little effect on N2O and NO emissions in the following year, while the nitrapyrin decreased NO, but not N2O emissions, probably due to suppression of denitrification caused by the low soil moisture content.

Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizers: Effect on Nitrous Oxide Emissions in Iowa. Fertilizer application in crop production agriculture is a major factor influencing soil emissions of the greenhouse gas N2O. Enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) have the potential to decrease N2O emissions by improving the synchrony between soil N supply and crop N demand. This study was conducted to compare the effects of N2O emissions from soil cropped to corn (Zea mays L.) and EEFs and conventional fertilizers. During a 3-yr period, growing-season N2O emissions were quantified in unfertilized check plots and plots fertilized with urea-NH4NO3 (UAN), UAN containing the urease and nitrification stabilizer AgrotainPlus (UAN+Ag), a stabilized urea containing urease and nitrification inhibitors (SuperU), and a controlled-release polymer-coated urea (ESN). In the third year of the study, conventional urea and an additional fertilizer formulation, Nutrisphere, were evaluated. We observed no reductions in cumulative seasonal N2O emissions from treatments fertilized with the EEFs in any of the study years. Generally, N2O emissions were significantly higher than emissions from the check (no fertilizer) treatment. There were no differences among fertilizer types except in 2009 when the ESN treatment had significantly higher emissions than the check, UAN, and UAN+Ag treatments. Our results indicate that, due to the episodic nature of N2O emissions induced by rainfall events, reduction of N2O emissions through the use of EEFs may be limited in rainfed regions.

Lower soil nitrogen-oxide emissions associated with enhanced denitrification under replacing mineral fertilizer with manure in orchard soils. Emerging evidence suggests that replacing mineral fertilizers with organic livestock manure can effectively suppress reactive gaseous nitrogen (N) emissions from soils. However, the extent of this mitigation potential and the underlying microbial mechanisms in orchards remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we measured nitrous and nitric oxide (N2O and NO) emissions, microbial N cycling gene abundance, and N2O isotopomer ratios in pear and citrus orchards under three different fertilization regimes: no fertilization, mineral fertilizer, and manure plus mineral fertilizer. The results showed that although manure application caused large transient peaks of N2O, it reduced cumulative emissions of N2O and NO by an average of 20 % and 17 %, respectively, compared to the mineral fertilizer treatment. Partial replacement of mineral fertilizers with manure enhanced the contribution of AOA to nitrification and reduced the contribution of AOB, thus reducing N2O emissions from nitrification. Isotope analysis suggested that the pathway for N2O production in the soils of both orchards was dominated by bacterial denitrification and nitrifier denitrification. The manure treatment reduced the ratio of denitrification products. Additionally, the dual isotope mixing model results indicated that partially replacing mineral fertilizers with manure could promote soil denitrification, resulting in more N2O being reduced. N -oxide emissions were on average 67 % higher in the pear orchard than in the citrus orchard, probably due to the differences in soil physicochemical properties and growth habits between the two orchards. These findings underscore the potential of partially replacing mineral fertilizers with organic manure in orchards to reduce gaseous N emissions, contributing to the transition towards environmentally sustainable and climate -smart agricultural practices.

DENITRIFICATION AND THE EVOLUTION OF NITROUS-OXIDE AFTER THE APPLICATION OF CATTLE SLURRY TO A PEAT SOIL. The impact of cattle slurry on denitrification losses and nitrous oxide emission was determined on a peat soil in the Netherlands. As well as measuring losses on a day-to-day basis after three different methods of slurry application, two methods for estimating denitrification and nitrous oxide emissions were compared, i.e. coring/incubation and enclosure techniques. Slurry was applied either in a conventional way, diluted 1:3 or acidified with nitric acid. There was much variation with time, method of assessment and method of slurry application in both apparent denitrification rates and N2O fluxes: it was not always possible to provide adequate explanation for all of the effects demonstrated. Major proportions of the variation in denitrification and N2O emission could be accounted for by variation in soil moisture, soil temperature and NH4+ (but not NO3-) content. It was suggested that nitrification was playing a key role in maintaining an adequate substrate supply (NO) for denitrification and perhaps contributing directly to an unknown extent to N2O emissions. There were overall differences in the extent of losses with the different methods of slurry application but these were highly dependent upon interactions with current soil and weather conditions.

Soil-atmosphere exchange potential of NO and N2O in different land use types of Inner Mongolia as affected by soil temperature, soil moisture, freeze-thaw, and drying-wetting events. Changes in precipitation and temperature in Asian continental steppelands may affect soil physical, chemical and biological processes that control the biosphere-atmosphere exchange of N-trace gases. The changes include regional desertification, global warming and strong El Nino events that impact the large steppe land area in China and Mongolia. The area is so large that feedbacks to the global greenhouse gas balance may occur. In this study we investigated how changes in soil moisture and temperature, and especially drying-rewetting and freeze-thaw events, affect nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from large intact soil cores taken from representative land use/cover types in the region of the Xilin River catchment, Inner Mongolia. These soil cores were incubated under varying conditions with respect to temperature (ranging from -10 to 15 degrees C) and simulated rainfall (25, 45 and 65 mm). Following drying-rewetting and freeze-thaw transitions, we observed pulses of NO and N2O emissions from the soils of typical steppe, mountain meadow, sand dune and marshland. A comparable trend in soil CO2 emissions and soil air N2O concentrations indicated that the high substrate availability and rapid recovery of microbial activity after soil wetting and thawing resulted in high gas fluxes. Across the whole temperature range, NO and N2O fluxes from all soils, except for N2O emissions from marshland soils, showed a positive exponential relationship with soil temperature. A combination of soil temperature and soil moisture explained most of the observed variations in NO (up to 74-90%) and N2O (up to 67-89%) fluxes for individual soils. Spatial differences in NO emissions between land use/cover types could be explained by differences in soil organic carbon and pH, whereas spatial variations of N2O fluxes were primarily correlated with differences in soil microbial biomass. On the basis of the incubation under controlled conditions, the average annual flux, weighted by the areal extent of the different investigated land use/cover types in the region, was estimated at similar to 3.9 +/- 1.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for NO and 0.53 +/- 0.20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O, respectively. It is noteworthy that our measurements were conducted using soil cores without a vegetation cover, which probably resulted in an overestimation of N-trace gas fluxes. However, our results indicate that the rarely determined NO formation appears to be a significant pathway in the N cycle of semiarid steppe, which is highly sensitive to the climatic change taking place in these regions, especially an increase in intensity and frequency of drying-wetting and freeze-thaw cycles.

Automated online measurement of N2, N2O, NO, CO2, and CH4 emissions based on a gas-flow-soil-core technique. The gas-flow-soil-core (GFSC) technique allows to directly measure emission rates of denitrification gases of incubated soil cores. However, the technique was still suffering some drawbacks such as inadequate accuracy due to asynchronous detection of dinitrogen (N-2) and other gases and low measurement frequency. Furthermore, its application was limited due to intensive manual operation. To overcome these drawbacks, we updated the GFSC system as described by Wang et al. (2011) by (a) using both a chemiluminescent detector and a gas chromatograph detector to measure nitric oxide (NO), (b) synchronizing the measurements of N-2, NO, nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), and (c) fully automating the sampling/analysis of all the gases. These technical modifications significantly reduced labor demands by at least a factor of two, increased the measurement frequency from 3 to 6 times per day and resulted in remarkable improvements in measurement accuracy (with detection limits of 0.5, 0.01, 0.05, 2.3 and 0.2 mu g N or C h(-1) kg(-1) ds, or 17, 0.3, 1.8, 82, and 6 mu g N or C m(-2) h(-1), for N-2, N2O, NO, CO2, and CH4, respectively). In some circumstances, the modified system measured significantly more N-2 and CO2 and less N2O and NO because of the enhanced measurement frequency. The modified system distinguished the differences in emissions of the denitrification gases and CO2 due to a 20% change in initial carbon supplies. It also remarkably recovered approximately 90% of consumed nitrate during incubation. These performances validate the technical improvement, and indicate that the improved GFSC system may provide a powerful research tool for obtaining deeper insights into the processes of soil carbon and nitrogen transformation during denitrification.

Effects of crop residue incorporation and properties on combined soil gaseous N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions-A laboratory-based measurement approach. Crop residues may serve as a significant source of soil emissions of N2O and other trace gases. According to the emission factors (EFs) set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), N2O emission is proportional to the amount of N added by residues to the soil. However, the effects of crop residues on the source and sink strength of agroecosystems for trace gases are regulated by their properties, such as the C and N content; C/N ratio; lignin, cellulose, and soluble fractions; and residue humidity. In the present study, an automated dynamic chamber method was used in combination with soil mesocosms to simultaneously measure the effects of nine different crop residues (oilseed rape, winter wheat, field pea, maize, potato, mustard, red clover, sugar beet, and iyegrass) on soil respiration (CO2) and reactive N fluxes (N2O, NO, and NH3 at a high temporal resolution. Specifically, crop residues were incorporated in the 0-4 cm topsoil layer and incubated for 60 days at a constant temperature (15 degrees C) and water-filled pore space (60% WFPS). Residue incorporation immediately and sharply increased soil N2O and CO2 emissions, but these were short-lived and returned to background levels within respectively 10 and 30 days. The magnitude of increase in soil NO flux following residue incorporation was lower than that in CO2 and N2O fluxes, with peak emissions observed around day 20. Overall, the N content or C/N ratio of the applied residue could not sufficiently explain the variation in soil N2O and NO emissions. The range of the calculated N2O EFs over a 60-day period was -0.17 to +45, being wider than that proposed by the IPCC -0.01 to +1.1). Therefore, the residue maturity stage may be used as a simple proxy to estimate the N2O + NO emissions from incorporated residue. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Linking NO and N2O emission pulses with the mobilization of mineral and organic N upon rewetting dry soils. Drying and rewetting of soils triggers a cascade of physical, chemical, and biological processes; understanding these responses to varying moisture levels becomes increasingly important in the context of changing precipitation patterns. When soils dry and water content decreases, diffusion is limited and substrates can accumulate. Upon rewetting, these substrates are mobilized and can energize hot moments of intense biogeochemical cycling, leading to pulses of trace gas emissions. Until recently, it was difficult to follow the rewetting dynamics of nutrient cycling in the field without physically disturbing the soil. Here we present a study that combines real-time trace gas measurements with high-resolution measurements of diffusive nutrient fluxes in intact soils. Our goal was to distinguish the contribution of different inorganic and organic nitrogen (N) forms to the rewetting substrate flush and the production of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Diffusive flux of N-bearing substrates (NO2-, NO3-, NHS and amino acids) was determined in situ in hourly resolution using a microdialysis approach. We conducted an irrigation experiment in a semi-arid California grassland at the end of the dry season, and followed soil N flux and N trace gas emissions over the course of 30 h post-wetting. Upon rewetting, both inorganic and organic N diffused through the soil, with inorganic N contributing most to the rewetting N flush. Emissions of NO and N2O rapidly increased and remained elevated for the duration of our measurements, whereas diffusive soil N flux was characterized by large temporal variation. Immediately after rewetting, NO3- contributed 80% to the total diffusive N flux but was consumed rapidly, possibly due to fast microbial uptake or denitrification. Ammonium flux contributed only similar to 10% to the initial diffusive N flux, but it dominated total N diffusion 27 h post-wetting, coinciding with peak N-gas emissions. This suggests nitrification may control most of the N trace gases produced during the late stages of a rewetting pulse. Nitrite contributed only 1% to total N diffusion and did not show a clear temporal pattern. Amino acids contributed roughly as much as NH4+ to the initial diffusive N flux, but the organic N pulse was short-lived, indicating that organic N did not contribute substantially to N-gas formation shortly after rewetting at our study site. Our results support the hypothesis that in semi-arid environments N-bearing substrates concentrate during dry periods and, upon rewetting, can lead to pulses of NO and N2O when they react chemically or are transformed by microorganisms.

Nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching from a rain-fed wheat-maize rotation in the Sichuan Basin, China. A 3-year field experiment (October 2004-October 2007) was conducted to quantify N2O fluxes and determine the regulating factors from rain-fed, N fertilized wheat-maize rotation in the Sichuan Basin, China. Static chamber-GC techniques were used to measure soil N2O fluxes in three treatments (three replicates per treatment): CK (no fertilizer); N150 (300 kg N fertilizer ha(-1) yr(-1) or 150 kg N ha(-1) per crop); N250 (500 kg N fertilizer ha(-1) yr(-1) kg or 250 kg N ha(-1) per crop). Nitrate (NO (3) (-) ) leaching losses were measured at nearby sites using free-drained lysimeters. The annual N2O fluxes from the N fertilized treatments were in the range of 1.9 to 6.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) corresponding to an N2O emission factor ranging from 0.12 % to 1.06 % (mean value: 0.61 %). The relationship between monthly soil N2O fluxes and NO (3) (-) leaching losses can be described by a significant exponential decaying function. The N2O emission factor obtained in our study was somewhat lower than the current IPCC default emission factor (1 %). Nitrate leaching, through removal of topsoil NO (3) (-) , is an underrated regulating factor of soil N2O fluxes from cropland, especially in the regions where high NO (3) (-) leaching losses occur.

Measurements of nitric oxide and ammonia soil fluxes from a wet savanna ecosystem site in West Africa during the DACCIWA field campaign. Biogenic fluxes from soil at a local and regional scale are crucial to study air pollution and climate. Here we present field measurements of soil fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) observed over four different land cover types, i.e. bare soil, grassland, maize field, and forest, at an inland rural site in Benin, West Africa, during the DACCIWA field campaign in June and July 2016. At the regional scale, urbanization and a massive growth in population in West Africa have been causing a strong increase in anthropogenic emissions. Anthropogenic pollutants are transported inland and northward from the megacities located on the coast, where the reaction with biogenic emissions may lead to enhanced ozone production outside urban areas, as well as secondary organic aerosol formation, with detrimental effects on humans, animals, natural vegetation, and crops. We observe NO fluxes up to 48.05 ngN m(-2) s(-1). NO fluxes averaged over all land cover types are 4.79 +/- 5.59 ngN m(-2) s(-1), and maximum soil emissions of NO are recorded over bare soil. NH3 is dominated by deposition for all land cover types. NH3 fluxes range between -6.59 and 4.96 ngN m(-2) s(-1). NH3 fluxes averaged over all land cover types are -0.91 +/- 1.27 ngN m(-2) s(-1), and maximum NH3 deposition is measured over bare soil. The observations show high spatial variability even for the same soil type, same day, and same meteorological conditions. We compare point daytime average measurements of NO emissions recorded during the field campaign with those simulated by GEOS-Chem (Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Model) for the same site and find good agreement. In an attempt to quantify NO emissions at the regional and national scale, we also provide a tentative estimate of total NO emissions for the entire country of Benin for the month of July using two distinct methods: upscaling point measurements and using the GEOS-Chem model. The two methods give similar results: 1.17 +/- 0.6 and 1.44 GgN month(-1), respectively. Total NH3 deposition estimated by upscaling point measurements for the month of July is 0.21 GgN month(-1).

Dinitrogen emissions: an overlooked key component of the N balance of montane grasslands. While emissions of nitric oxide (NO), ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from grassland soils have been increasingly well constrained, soil dinitrogen (N-2) emissions are poorly understood. However, N-2 losses might dominate total gaseous nitrogen (N) losses. Knowledge on N losses is key for the development of climate-adapted management that balances agronomic and environmental needs. Hence, we quantified all gaseous N losses from a montane grassland in Southern Germany both for ambient climatic conditions and for a climate change treatment (+2 degrees C MAT, -300mm MAP). Monthly measurements of soil N-2 emissions of intact soil cores revealed that those exceeded by far soil N2O emissions and averaged at 350 +/- 101 (ambient climate) and 738 +/- 197 mu gN m(-2) h(-1) (climate change). Because these measurements did not allow to quantify emission peaks after fertilization, an additional laboratory experiment was deployed to quantify the response of NH3, NO, N2O, and N-2 emissions in sub daily temporal resolution to a typical slurry fertilization event (51kgN ha(-1)). Our results revealed that total N gas losses amounted to roughly half of applied slurry-N. Surprisingly, N-2 but not NH3 dominated fertilizer N losses, with N-2 emissions accounting for 16-21kg or 31-42% of the applied slurry-N, while NH3 volatilization (3.5kg), N2O (0.2-0.5kg) and NO losses (0-0.2kg) were of minor importance. Though constraining annual N-2 loss remained uncertain due to high spatiotemporal variability of fluxes, we show that N-2 losses are a so far overlooked key component of the N balance in montane grasslands, which needs to be considered for developing improved grassland management strategies targeted at increasing N use efficiency.

Nitric oxide fluxes from an agricultural soil using a flux-gradient method. Soil emission of nitric oxide may be a significant source of NOx in rural areas. Agricultural practices may enhance these emissions by addition of nitrogen fertilizers,A system that enables continuous measurement of NO fluxes from agricultural surfaces using the flux-gradient method was developed. Hourly differences in NO concentrations in air sampled at two intake heights (0.6 and 1 m) were determined using a chemiluminescence analyzer. Eddy diffusivities were determined using wind profiles (cup anemometers), and stability corrections calculated using a 5 cm path sonic anemometer. Fast switching of sampling between air intake heights (every 30 s) and determination of concentration values at a frequency of 2 Hz minimized the errors due to fluctuations in background concentration. Low travel times for air samples in the tubing (similar to 8 s) were estimated to result in small errors in flux values (<0.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) due to chemical reactions. The overall resolution of the system was estimated as similar to 1 ng N m(-2) s(-1). NO fluxes from a bare soil were measured quasi-continuously from January to June 1995 at Elora, Canada, comprising a total of 1833 hourly values. Daily NO fluxes before nitrogen fertilization were small, increasing after nitrogen fertilizer was added (>10 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) Monthly NO fluxes estimated were similar to those observed in previous studies. The designed system could be easily modified to measure NOx and NO fluxes by using an additional chemiluminescence analyzer. The system also could be adapted to measure fluxes sequentially from various plots, enabling testing of agricultural practices on NO emissions.

N2O and NO emissions from an Andisol field as influenced by pelleted poultry manure. Animal manures from intensive livestock operations can be pelleted to improve handlings and recyclings of embodied nutrients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of pelleted poultry manure on N2O and NO fluxes from an Andisol field. In autumn 2006 and summer 2007, poultry manure (PM), pelleted poultry manure (PP), and chemical fertilizer (CF) were applied at a rate of 120 kg N ha(-1) in each cultivation period to Komatsuna (Brossica rapa var. peruviridis). Nitrous oxide and NO fluxes were measured using an automated monitoring system. A soil incubation experiment was also conducted to determine the influence of intact and ground pelleted manure on N2O, NO. and CO2 production with a water-filled pore space (WFPS) of 30 or 50%. In the field measurements, N2O emission rates from the organic fertilizer treatments were larger than that from the CIF treatment. possibly because organic C stimulated denitrification. The highest N2O flux was observed from the PP treatment after a rainfall following fertilization, and the cumulative emission rate (2.72 +/- 0.22 kg N ha(-1) Y-1) was 3.9 and 7.1 times that from the PM and CIF treatments, respectively. In contrast, NO emission rates were highest from the CIF treatment. The NO/N2O flux ratio indicated that nitrification was the dominant process for NO and N2O production from the CF treatment. Cumulative N2O emission rates from all treatments were generally higher during the wetter cultivation period (autumn 2006) than during the drier cultivation period (summer 2007). In contrast, NO emission rates were higher in the drier than in the wetter cultivation period. The incubation experiment results showed a synergistic effect of soil moisture and the pelleted manure form on N2O emission rates. The intact pelleted manure with the 50% WFPS treatment produced the highest N2O and CO2 fluxes and resulted in the lowest soil NO3- content after the incubation. These results indicate that anaerobic conditions inside the pellets, caused by rainfall and heterotrophic microbial activities, led to denitrification, resulting in high N2O fluxes. Controlling the timing of N application by avoiding wet conditions might be one mitigation option to reduce N2O emission rates from the PP treatment in this study field. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Fine root dynamics and trace gas fluxes in two lowland tropical forest soils. Fine root dynamics have the potential to contribute significantly to ecosystem-scale biogeochemical cycling, including the production and emission of greenhouse gases. This is particularly true in tropical forests which are often characterized as having large fine root biomass and rapid rates of root production and decomposition. We examined patterns in fine root dynamics on two soil types in a lowland moist Amazonian forest, and determined the effect of root decay on rates of C and N trace gas fluxes. Root production averaged 229 (+/-35) and 153 (+/-27) g m(-2) yr(-1) for years 1 and 2 of the study, respectively, and did not vary significantly with soil texture. Root decay was sensitive to soil texture with faster rates in the clay soil (k=-0.96 year(-1)) than in the sandy loam soil (k=-0.61 year(-1)), leading to greater standing stocks of dead roots in the sandy loam. Rates of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were significantly greater in the clay soil (13+/-1 ng N cm(-2) h(-1)) than in the sandy loam (1.4+/-0.2 ng N cm(-2) h(-1)). Root mortality and decay following trenching doubled rates of N2O emissions in the clay and tripled them in sandy loam over a 1-year period. Trenching also increased nitric oxide fluxes, which were greater in the sandy loam than in the clay. We used trenching (clay only) and a mass balance approach to estimate the root contribution to soil respiration. In clay soil root respiration was 264-380 g C m(-2) yr(-1), accounting for 24% to 35% of the total soil CO2 efflux. Estimates were similar using both approaches. In sandy loam, root respiration rates were slightly higher and more variable (521+/-206 g C m(2) yr(-1)) and contributed 35% of the total soil respiration. Our results show that soil heterotrophs strongly dominate soil respiration in this forest, regardless of soil texture. Our results also suggest that fine root mortality and decomposition associated with disturbance and land-use change can contribute significantly to increased rates of nitrogen trace gas emissions.

Mitigating N2O and NO Emissions from Direct-Seeded Rice with Nitrification Inhibitor and Urea Deep Placement. Soil-emitted nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) in crop production are harmful nitrogen (N) emissions that may contribute both directly and indirectly to global warming. Application of nitrification inhibitors, such as dicyandiamide (DCD), and urea deep placement (UDP), are considered effective approaches to reduce these emissions. This study investigated the effects of DCD and UDP, compared to urea and potassium nitrate, on emissions, nitrogen use efficiency and grain yields under direct-seeded rice. High-frequency measurements of N2O and NO emissions were conducted using the automated closed chamber method throughout the crop-growing season and during the ratoon crop. Both UDP and DCD were effective in reducing N2O emissions by 95% and 73%, respectively. The highest emission factor (1.53% of applied N) was observed in urea, while the lowest was in UDP (0.08%). Emission peaks were mainly associated with fertilization events and appeared within one to two weeks of fertilization. Those emission peaks contributed to 65%-98% of the total seasonal emissions. Residual effects of fertilizer treatments on the N2O emissions from the ratoon crop were not significant; however, the urea treatment contributed 2%, whereas UDP contributed to 44% of the total annual emissions. On the other hand, cumulative NO emissions were not significant in either the rice or ratoon crops. UDP and DCD increased grain yields by 16%-19% and N recovery efficiency by 30%-40% over urea. The results suggested that the use of DCD and UDP could mitigate N2O emissions and increase grain yields and nitrogen use efficiency under direct-seeded rice condition.

Proper organic substitution attenuated both N2O and NO emissions derived from AOB in vegetable soils by enhancing the proportion of Nitrosomonas.

However, few evaluations have been performed on the changes in the community structure and abun-dance of soil ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) under substituting portion of chemical fertilizers with organic manure (organic substitution) and their relative contribution to the ammonia oxida-tion process. Here, five long-term fertilization strategies were applied in field (SN: synthetic fertilizer application; OM: organic manure; M1N1: substituting 50 % of chemical N fertilizer with organic manure; M1N4: substituting 20 % of chemical N fertilizer with organic manure; and CK: no fertilizer). We investigated the response characteristics of AOB and AOA community structures by selective inhibitor shaking assays and high-throughput sequencing and further explained their relative contribution to the ammonia oxidation process during three consecutive years of vegetable production. Compared to SN and M1N4, the potential of ammonia oxidation (PAO) was significantly reduced by 26.4 % and 22.3 % in OM and 9.5 % and 4.4 % in M1N1, resulting in N2O reductions of 38.9 % and 30.8 % (OM) and 31.2 % and 21.1 % (M1N1), respectively, and NO reductions of 45.0 % and 34.1 % (OM) and 40.1 % and 28.3 % (M1N1). RDA and correlation analyses showed that the soil organic carbon and ammonium nitrogen content increased while AOB gene abundance and diversity significantly decreased with increasing organic replacement ratio; however, the relative abundance of Nitrosomonas in AOB increased in OM and M1N1, which further demonstrates that AOB are the main driver in vegetable soils. Therefore, the appropriate proportion of organic substitution (OM and M1N1) could decrease the N2O and NO emissions contributed by AOB by affecting the soil physicochemical properties and AOB community structure.

Land use change and biogeochemical controls of nitrogen oxide emissions from soils in eastern Amazonia. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the effects of land use change on N oxide fluxes from soil in seasonally dry, eastern Amazonia and (2) evaluate the \"hole-in-the-pipe\" model in a field setting where N availability varies among land uses and soil moisture varies among seasons. We measured N oxide flux from an old-growth forest, a 20-year-old secondary forest, an active pasture, and a degraded pasture. We also measured soil water content, soil inorganic N stocks, net N mineralization and nitrification potential. To determine the effects of pasture age on N oxide flux, we measured gas fluxes at a chronosequence of pastures (0-13 years). In the land use study, N2O fluxes followed the order: primary forest (2.4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) > secondary forest (0.9 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) > active pasture (0.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) > degraded pasture (0.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), and NO fluxes followed the order: primary forest (1.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) > degraded pasture (0.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) 2 active pasture (0.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) 2 secondary forest (0.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). In the chronosequence study, no trend in N oxide emissions with pasture age was apparent, but emissions from pastures were lower than from the forest. Total N oxide flux correlated with a laboratory measure of nitrification potential (r(2) = 0.85). The ratio N2O:NO correlated with soil water content (r(2) = 0.56). Parameterization of the model accounted for variability in N oxide emissions across land uses and seasons and the model application revealed the importance of studying both N oxide gases simultaneously. Model predictions for six independent sites agreed well with observed fluxes, suggesting that the model may be applicable at a broader scale. The consistently low annual emissions of N2O estimated for all of the Amazonian pastures that we studied suggest that conversions of tropical forests to cattle pastures may not in the long term cause a significant increase in the contribution of soil emissions to atmospheric N2O or NO.

N2O and NOx emissions by reactions of nitrite with soil organic matter of a Norway spruce forest. Nitrite (NO2 (-)) as an important intermediate of the biological nitrogen cycle is particularly reactive in acidic soils and acts as a source of N2O and NOx (NO and NO2). However, abiotic and biotic pathways of NO2 (-)-driven N2O and NOx production in forest soil and the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in these processes are still unclear. In this study, NO2 (-) was applied to both unsterile and sterilized soil samples as well as to different SOM fractions from a Norway spruce forest. Biotic and abiotic N2O emission was measured with an infrared absorption analyzer and gas chromatography, while NOx emission was quantified with a chemiluminescence analyzer. Isotopic signatures of N2O (delta N-15(bulk), delta O-18, and N-15-N2O site preference) were analyzed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. After NO2 (-) addition, a large amount of NOx was emitted immediately, while N2O emission occurred 15-60 min later and was much lower compared to NOx. Sterilization of soil decreased N2O emission significantly, but not NOx emission. The N-15 site preference of N2O ranged from 7.98 to 11.58aEuro degrees for abiotic and 4.69-7.42aEuro degrees for biotic sources. The fulvic acid fraction contributed the most to abiotic N2O emission, while the fastest NO and N2O emission occurred after NO2 (-)application to the humin fraction, followed by the humic acid fraction. These results are important for the future understanding of NOx and N2O sources, as well as the use of isotopic signatures for source-partitioning N2O emission from soil.

D17302. Effects of soil moisture and temperature on NO, NO2, and N2O emissions from European forest soils -: art. no. D17302. [1] Emissions of NO, NO2, and N2O to the atmosphere were measured with a fully automated laboratory system from undisturbed soil columns obtained from five different temperate and one boreal forest sites. The soils were chosen to cover a transect through Europe, sandy and loamy textures, and different atmospheric nitrogen deposition rates. In a two-factorial experimental design, soil cores were kept under varying conditions with respect to temperature (range 5 - 20degreesC) and soil moisture ( range 0 - 300 kPa). The combination of soil temperature and soil moisture could explain a better part of variations in NO (up to 74%) and N2O ( up to 86%) emissions for individual soils, but average emissions differed significantly between various forest soils. Generally, NO and N2O were emitted from all soils except from the boreal pine forest soil, where NO was consumed. NO emissions from the German spruce forest receiving highest yearly nitrogen inputs of > 35 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) ranged from 1.3 to 608.9 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1) and largely exceeded emissions from other soils. Average N2O emissions from this soil tended also to be highest (171.7 +/- 42.2 mug N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)), but did not differ significantly from other soils. NO2 deposition occurred in all soils and strongly correlated to NO emissions. NO and N2O emissions showed a positive exponential relationship to soil temperature. With activation energies between 57 and 133 kJ mol(-1), N2O emissions from the various soils responded more uniformely to temperature than NO emissions with 41 and 199 kJ mol(-1). The two Austrian beech forest soils showed exceptionally high activation energies for NO emissions, which might be attributed to chemodenitrification. N2O emissions increased with increasing water filled pore space (WFPS) or decreasing water tension, respectively. Maximal N2O emissions were measured between 80 and 95% WFPS or 0 kPa water tension. Optimal moisture for NO emission differed significantly between the soils, and ranged between 15% WFPS in sandy Italian floodplain soil and 65% in loamy Austrian beech forest soils. These differences may be related to the specific adaptation of the microbial communities to draught conditions. C1 Fed Off & Res Ctr Forests BFW, Inst Forest Ecol, A-1131 Vienna, Austria.

Soil nitric oxide emissions from two subtropical humid forests in south China. Due to the dense population, rapid industrialization, and intensified agricultural activities, some regions in Asia are hot spots of airborne nitrogen oxides and also areas with increasing nitrogen deposition. Therefore the cycling of nitrogen gases in Asia might be of increasing importance on both a regional and a global scale for atmospheric chemistry and budgets of nitrogen. Yet, to date, knowledge of soil NO emission is quite limited in Asia, particularly in forest ecosystems. In this study, soil NO emissions in two subtropical humid forests, a broadleaf forest in climax successional stage and a pine forest in primary successional stage, were measured throughout the year 2005 in Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, south China. In the broadleaf forest, mean NO emission in wet season (14.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) was lower than in dry season (23.8 ng N m(-2) s(-1)). In the pine forest, however, mean NO emission in wet season (17.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) was higher than in dry season (7.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1)). In both forests, soil water content was the dominant factor controlling the seasonal patterns of NO emissions, and soil NO emission was significantly correlated to percent water filled pore space (% WFPS) in a quadratic manner (p < 0.001). Annual NO emissions in the broadleaf forest and the pine forest were preliminarily estimated to be 6.1-6.9 and 4.0-4.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, by using three upscaling methods.

Nitric oxide: The versatility of an extensive signal molecule. Nitric oxide (NO) is a small highly diffusible gas and a ubiquitous bioactive molecule. Its chemical properties make NO a versatile signal molecule that functions through interactions with cellular targets via either redox or additive chemistry. In plants, NO plays a role in a broad spectrum of pathophysiological and developmental processes. Although nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-dependent NO production has been reported in plants, no gene, cDNA, or protein has been isolated to date. In parallel, precise and regulated NO production can be measured from the activity of the ubiquitous enzyme nitrate reductase (NR). In addition to endogenous NO formation, high NO emissions are observed from fertilized soils, but their effects on the physiology of plants are largely unknown. Many environmental and hormonal stimuli are transmitted either directly or indirectly by NO signaling cascades. The ability of NO to act simultaneously on several unrelated biochemical nodes and its redox homeostatic properties suggest that it might be a synchronizing molecule in plants.

Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from maize field plots as affected by N fertilizer type and application method. NO and NO emissions from an Andisol maize field were studied. The experimental treatments were incorporation of urea into the plough layer at 250 kg N ha(-1) by two applications (U1250), band application of urea at a depth of 8 cm at 75 kg N ha(-1) plus incorporation of urea into the plough layer at 75 kg N ha(-1) (UB150), band application of polyolefin-coated urea at a depth of 5 cm at 150 kg N ha(-1) (CB150), and a control (without N application). N2O fluxes from U1250 and UB 150 peaked following the incorporation of supplementary fertilizer, and declined to the background level after that, while the NO flux from CB 150 was relatively low but remained at constant level until shortly after harvest. Accordingly, the total N2O emissions during the whole cultivation period from the three treatments were not significantly different. The fertilizer-derived N2O-N losses from U1250, UB150 and CB150 were 0.15%, 0.27% and 0.28% of the applied N, respectively. However, it was suggested that, due to the low plant N recovery, U1250 had a significantly larger potential for indirect N2O emission than the other treatments. On the other hand, NO emissions from U1250 and UB 150 were 12 times higher than that from CB 150, and the fertilizer-derived NO-N losses from the three treatments were 0.16%, 0.27% and 0.026% of the applied N, respectively. Significant NO fluxes were detected only when urea-N fertilizer was surface-applied and incorporated into plough-layer soil. C1 Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan.

NITROGEN COMPOUND EMISSIONS FROM FERTILIZED SOILS IN A MAIZE FIELD PINE TREE FOREST AGROSYSTEM IN THE SOUTHWEST OF FRANCE. The use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture is a significant source of reactive nitrogen compounds for the atmosphere. Emissions of NO, NH3, and N2O were measured on irrigated maize fields, on acidic podzols, set up in a large pine tree forest system in the southwestern part of France. Measurements were carried out over a yearly period: before, during, and after fertilization. Trace gas emissions appear to be strongly linked to soil characteristics and to the type of fertilizer and application procedures used. All emissions are strongly enhanced after fertilizer application, although NO and N2O emissions are observed all year long. No emission was observed on forest soils which only constitute an atmospheric NO2 sink. The imbalance of the nitrogen budget (up to 100 kg N ha-1) might be explained by gaseous emissions into the atmosphere, watertable pollution by nitrate and ammonium ions remaining very low. This is one of the peculiarities of this agrosystem. C1 UNIV TOULOUSE 3, ZENTRUM HYDROBIOL, CNRS, URA 695, F-31062 TOULOUSE, FRANCE.

The effect of temperature and moisture on trace gas emissions from deciduous and coniferous leaf litter. The forest litter layer lies at the boundary between soil and atmosphere and is a major factor in biogeochemical cycles. While there are several studies on how the litter layer controls soil trace gas emissions, litter emissions itself are less well understood, and it is still unclear how important gases respond to changing temperature and moisture. In order to assess leaf litter gas exchange, we conducted laboratory incubation experiments in which the full set of climate relevant gases, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and nitric oxide (NO) coming from deciduous and coniferous leaf litter were measured at five temperatures and seven moisture contents. In addition, we compared litter and soil from different origin in terms of temperature/moisture responses of gas fluxes and investigated possible interactions between the two climate factors. Deciduous litter emitted more CO2 (up to 335mg CO2-Ckg(-1)h(-1)) than coniferous litter, whereas coniferous litter released maximum amounts of NO (207 mu gNO-Nkg(-1)h(-1)). N2O was only emitted from litter under very moist and warm conditions (>70% wet weight, >10 degrees C). CH4 emissions were close to zero. Temperature sensitivities of litter emissions were generally lower than for soil emissions. Nevertheless, wet and warm conditions always enhanced litter emissions, suggesting a strong feedback effect of the litter layer to predicted future climate change.

Soil pH as the chief modifier for regional nitrous oxide emissions: New evidence and implications for global estimates and mitigation. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas that also plays the primary role in stratospheric ozone depletion. The use of nitrogen fertilizers is known as the major reason for atmospheric N2O increase. Empirical bottom-up models therefore estimate agricultural N2O inventories using N loading as the sole predictor, disregarding the regional heterogeneities in soil inherent response to external N loading. Several environmental factors have been found to influence the response in soil N2O emission to N fertilization, but their interdependence and relative importance have not been addressed properly. Here, we show that soil pH is the chief factor explaining regional disparities in N2O emission, using a global meta-analysis of 1,104 field measurements. The emission factor (EF) of N2O increases significantly (p < .001) with soil pH decrease. The default EF value of 1.0%, according to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change) for agricultural soils, occurs at soil pH 6.76. Moreover, changes in EF with N fertilization (i.e. EF) is also negatively correlated (p < .001) with soil pH. This indicates that N2O emission in acidic soils is more sensitive to changing N fertilization than that in alkaline soils. Incorporating our findings into bottom-up models has significant consequences for regional and global N2O emission inventories and reconciling them with those from top-down models. Moreover, our results allow region-specific development of tailor-made N2O mitigation measures in agriculture.

A review of carbon farming impacts on nitrogen cycling, retention, and loss. Soil carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural working lands via soil amendments and management practices is considered a relatively well-tested and affordable approach for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Carbon farming provides useful benefits for soil health, biomass production, and crop resilience, but the effects of different soil C sequestration approaches on the nitrogen (N) cycle remain controversial. While some C farming practices have been shown to reduce N fertilizer use in some cases, C farming could also impose an unwanted \"N penalty\" through which soil C gains can only be maintained with additional N inputs, thereby increasing N losses to the environment. We systematically reviewed meta-analysis studies on the impacts of C farming on N cycling in agroecosystems and estimated the cumulative effect of several C farming practices on N cycling. We found that, on average, combined C farming practices significantly reduced nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching from soils, thus inferring both N cycling and climate change benefits. In addition to more widely studied C farming practices that generate organic C, we also discuss silicate rock additions, which offer a pathway to inorganic C sequestration that does not require additional N inputs, framing important questions for future research.

Controls over nitric oxide and ammonia emissions from Mojave Desert soils. Emissions of reactive N compounds produced during terrestrial N cycling can be an important N loss pathway from ecosystems. Most measurements of this process focus on NO and N2O efflux; however, in alkaline soils such as those in the Mojave Desert, NH3 production can be an important component of N gas loss. We investigated patterns of NO and NH3 emissions in the Mojave Desert and identified seasonal changes in temperature, precipitation and spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrients as primary controllers of soil efflux. Across all seasons, NH3 dominated reactive N gas emissions with fluxes ranging from 0.9 to 10 ng N m(-2) s(-1) as compared to NO fluxes of 0.08-1.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1). Fluxes were higher in April and July than in October; however, a fall precipitation event yielded large increases in both NO and NH3 efflux. To explore the mechanisms driving field observations, we combined NO and NH3 soil flux measurements with laboratory manipulations of temperature, water and nutrient conditions. These experiments showed a large transient NH3 pulse (similar to 70-100 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) following water addition, presumably driven by an increase in soil NH4+ concentrations. This was followed by an increase in NO production, with maximum NO flux rates of 34 ng N m(-2) s(-1). Our study suggests that immediately following water addition NH3 volatilization proceeds at high rates due to the absence of microbial competition for NH4+; during this period N gas loss is insensitive to changes in temperature and soil nutrients. Subsequently, NO emission increases and rates of both NO and NH3 emission are sensitive to temperature and nutrient constraints on microbial activity. Addition of labile C reduces gaseous N losses, presumably by increasing microbial immobilization, whereas addition of NO3- stimulates NO and NH3 efflux.

Inhibitor-coated enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers for mitigating NOx and N2O emissions in a high-temperature irrigated agroecosystem. Nitrogen (N) fertilizers have substantially increased global crop yields around the world during recent decades. Nevertheless, the extensive use of N fertilizers at global scale has converted agricultural fertilized soils into an important anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx). The application of enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers, with the addition of urease and nitrification inhibitors (UI and NI, respectively), facilitates the reduction of N2O and NOx emissions and the improvement of agronomic responses. Despite the fact that soil N2O emissions have been widely studied under a large variety of climatic conditions and with different enhanced-efficiency N fertilizer, few studies have focused on soil NOx emissions, particularly in high temperature environments. The main aim of this study, therefore, was the quantification of NO and NO2 fluxes at a high temporal resolution using an automatic measurement system with the capacity to evaluate 5 different treatments with three replicates, and the ambient gas concentration. In addition, N2O emissions were measured with the static chamber method. With respect to the urea (U) treatment, the results confirm a significant mitigation of N2O and NO losses with the use of the new experimental inhibitor, DMPSA, alone or combined with the urease inhibitor NBPT. Overall, NOx emissions decreased by more than 60% in all the treatments in which synthetic inhibitors (both UI and NI) were applied, while N2O emissions were reduced by more than 35% in all the fertilized treatments when compared with urea alone. The high temporal resolution allowed the observation of negative fluxes of NO and NO2 in the different treatments, although these were more frequent and intense in the U + NI treatment. In general, grain and biomass yield were not affected by the use of NI or UI. The combined result was that a substantial reduction of yield-scaled-N2O and yield-scaled-NOx emissions was obtained when these inhibitors were used with urea and, therefore, their use should be recommended for mitigating these emissions whilst maintaining yields.

Emissions of nitric and nitrous oxide (NO and N2O) from agricultural soils may have several consequences, including impacts on local tropospheric and global stratospheric chemistry. Elevated NO and N2O emissions following application of anhydrous ammonia to an agricultural field in California were driven by the biological generation of nitrite (NO2.) and subsequent abiotic decomposition of nitrous acid (HNO2). Maximum fluxes of > 1000 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1) and > 400 ng N2O-N cm(-2) h(-1) were observed, and emissions of > 1000 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1) and > 50 ng N2O-N cm(-2) h(-1) persisted for > 4 weeks. Laboratory experiments were performed to determine race coefficients and activation energies for HNO2-mediated NO and N2O production. Kinetic parameters describing the conversion of NO to N2O were measured and were found to vary with water-filled pore space (WFPS). Regression models incorporating HNO2, WFPS, and temperature accounted for 75-77 % of the variability in field fluxes. A previously developed NO emissions model was modified to incorporate a kinetic expression for HNO2- and temperature-dependent production. The model tended to underestimate fluxes under low-flux conditions and overestimate fluxes under high-flux conditions, These data indicate that (1) control of acidity may be an effective means for minimizing gaseous N losses from fertilized soils and possibly for improving air quality in rural areas, (2) the transformation of HNO2-derived NO may be an important mechanism of N2O production even under relatively aerobic conditions, and (3) mechanistic models which account for spatial heterogeneity and transient conditions may be required to better predict field NO fluxes.

Geothermal areas can be local sources of greenhouse gases, both directly from the geothemral system or because of soil warming effects on biological sources. In this study we repeated field measurements methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes along the soil temperature (T-s) gradient in a Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) stand at the FoHlot study site in southern Iceland, where geothermal soil warming had started eight years earlier. We complemented these results with in situ measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and topsoil sampled in the same plots to study the production rates of those gases at 20 degrees C in the laboratory, as well as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO). We showed that the eight year long exposure to elevated T-s had changed the topsoil, including its microbial properties and the production potentials of these gases. However, the production rates of CO2, CH4 and N2O measured in laboratory conditions did not clearly follow the in situ fluxes. We discuss both adaptation of microbes and origin of greenhouse gases (depth patterns and microbial vs. geothermal sources) as possible reasons for these discrepancies.

Evaluation of greenhouse gas emissions in a Miscanthus sinensis Andersson-dominated semi-natural grassland in Kumamoto, Japan. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic activities continue to be a mounting problem worldwide. In the semi-natural Miscanthus sinensis Andersson; grasslands of Aso, Kumamoto, Japan, which have been managed for thousands of years, we measured soil methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions before and after annual controlled burns. We estimated annual soil carbon (C) accumulation, and CH4 and N2O emissions induced by biomass burning in 2009 and 2010, to determine the impacts of this ecosystem and its management on global warming. Environmental factors affecting soil CH4 and N2O fluxes were unknown, with no effect of annual burning observed on short-term soil CH4 and N2O emissions. However, deposition of charcoal during burning may have enhanced CH4 oxidation and N2O consumption at the study site, given that emissions (CH4: -4.33kgCha(-1) yr(-1), N2O: 0.17kgNha(-1) yr(-1)) were relatively lower than those measured in other land-use types. Despite significant emission of CH4 and N2O during yearly burning events in early spring, the M. sinensis semi-natural grassland had a large annual soil C accumulation, which resulted in a global warming potential of -4.86 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1). Consequently, our results indicate that long-term maintenance of semi-natural M. sinensis grasslands by annual burning can contribute to the mitigation of global warming.

Soil biogenic NO emission is one of the most important sources of atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx) worldwide. However, the estimation of soil source, especially in arid areas presents large uncertainties because of the substantial lack of measurements. In this study, we selected the Ruoqiang oases on the southeastern edge of the Taklimakan Desert, China as the study area and applied Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 retrievals (DOMINO v2.0, 2005-2011) to investigate the spatial distribution and seasonal variations in tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD). High NO2 VCDs were observed over the oases (farmlands and natural vegetation), with the highest value obtained during summer, and lowest during winter. Pulses were observed during spring. We conducted in-situ measurements in June 2011 in Milan oasis and employed ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments to validate satellite NO2 retrievals. The findings are as follows: 1) in the study area soil biogenic NO emission is the dominant source of tropospheric NO2; 2) oases (farmlands) are hotspots of tropospheric NO2, and a higher increase in tropospheric NO2 is found in oases from winter to summer; and 3) enhancement of soil biogenic NO emission due to soil managements is predictable. Given the rapid agricultural development in the southern Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, researches on soil biogenic NO emission and increase in tropospheric NOx should be given more importance.

Effects of soil moisture on gross N transformations and N2O emission in acid subtropical forest soils. Soil moisture changes, arising from seasonal variation or from global climate changes, could influence soil nitrogen (N) transformation rates and N availability in unfertilized subtropical forests. A (15) N dilution study was carried out to investigate the effects of soil moisture change (30-90 % water-holding capacity (WHC)) on potential gross N transformation rates and N2O and NO emissions in two contrasting (broad-leaved vs. coniferous) subtropical forest soils. Gross N mineralization rates were more sensitive to soil moisture change than gross NH4 (+) immobilization rates for both forest soils. Gross nitrification rates gradually increased with increasing soil moisture in both forest soils. Thus, enhanced N availability at higher soil moisture values was attributed to increasing gross N mineralization and nitrification rates over the immobilization rate. The natural N enrichment in humid subtropical forest soils may partially be due to fast N mineralization and nitrification under relatively higher soil moisture. In broad-leaved forest soil, the high N2O and NO emissions occurred at 30 % WHC, while the reverse was true in coniferous forest soil. Therefore, we propose that there are different mechanisms regulating N2O and NO emissions between broad-leaved and coniferous forest soils. In coniferous forest soil, nitrification may be the primary process responsible for N2O and NO emissions, while in broad-leaved forest soil, N2O and NO emissions may originate from the denitrification process.

Annual N2O emissions from conventionally grazed typical alpine grass meadows in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Annual nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from high-altitude alpine meadow grasslands have not been effectively characterized because of the scarcity of whole-year measurements. The authors performed a year-round measurement of N2O fluxes from three conventionally grazed alpine meadows that represent the typical meadow landscape in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The results showed that annual N2O emissions averaged 0.123 +/- 0.053 (2SD, i.e., the double standard deviation indicating the 95% confidence interval) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) across the three meadow sites. N2O flux pulses during the spring freezing-thawing period (FTP) were observed at only one site, indicating a large spatial variability in association with soil moisture differences. Approximately 34-57% (mean: 46%) of the annual N2O emissions occurred in the non-growing season, highlighting the substantial importance of accurate flux observations during this period. The simultaneous observations showed conservative, marginal nitric oxide (NO) fluxes of 0.058 +/- 0.032 (2SD) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The N2O fluxes across the three field sites correlated negatively with the soil nitrate concentrations during the entire year-round period (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a significant joint regulatory effect of topsoil temperature and moisture on the N2O and NO fluxes was observed during the relatively warm periods. Based on the results of the present and previous studies, a simple extrapolation roughly estimated the annual total N2O emission from Chinese grasslands to be 73 +/- 15 (2SD) Gg N yr(-1) (1 Gg = 10(9) g). A linear dependence of the annual N2O fluxes on the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was also found. This result may provide a simple approach for estimating the N2O emission inventories of frigid alpine or temperate grasslands that are ungrazed either in the summer or year round. However, further confirmation of this relationship with a wider ANPP range is still needed in the future studies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nitrous oxide emissions from an irrigated soil as affected by fertilizer and straw management. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from farmland is a concern for both environmental quality and agricultural productivity. Field experiments were conducted in 1996-1997 to assess soil N2O emissions as affected by timing of N fertilizer application and straw/tillage practices for crop production under irrigation in southern Alberta. The crops were soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 1996 and canola (Brassica napus L.) in 1997. Nitrous oxide flux from soil was measured using a vented chamber technique and calculated from the increase in concentration with time. Nitrous oxide fluxes for all treatments varied greatly during the year, with the greatest fluxes occurring in association with freeze-thaw events during March and April. Emissions were greater when N fertilizer (100 kg N ha(-1)) was applied in the fall compared to spring application. Straw removal at harvest in the fall increased N2O emissions when N fertilizer was applied in the fall, but decreased emissions when no fertilizer was applied. Fall plowing also increased N2O emissions compared to spring plowing or direct seeding. The study showed that N2O emissions may be minimized by applying N fertilizer in spring, retaining straw, and incorporating it in spring. The estimates of regional N2O emissions based on a fixed proportion of applied N may be tenuous since N2O emission varied widely depending on straw and fertilizer management practices.

Mitigating release of the potent greenhouse gas N2O from the nitrogen cycle - could enzymic regulation hold the key?. When faced with a shortage of oxygen, many bacterial species use nitrate to support respiration via the process of denitrification. This takes place extensively in nitrogen-rich soils and generates the gaseous products nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N-2). The denitrifying bacteria protect themselves from the endogenous cytotoxic NO produced by converting it to N2O, which can be released into the atmosphere. However, N2O is a potent greenhouse gas and hence the activity of the enzyme that breaks down N2O has a crucial role in restricting its atmospheric levels. Here, we review the current understanding of the process by which N2O is produced and destroyed and discuss the potential for feeding this into new approaches for combating N2O release.

Mechanisms of N2O and NO production in the soil profile of a drained and forested peatland, as studied with acetylene, nitrapyrin and dimethyl ether. Acetylene, dimethyl ether (DME) and 2-chloro-6-trichloromethyl pyridine (nitrapyrin) were used as inhibitors to study the contributions of nitrification and denitrification to the production of N2O and nitric oxide (NO) in samples taken from the soil profile of a peatland drained for forestry. Acetylene and DME inhibited 60-100% of the nitrification activity in field-moist samples from the 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm peat layers, whereas nitrapyrin had no inhibitory effect. In the 0-5 cm peat layer the N2O production could be reduced by up to 90% with inhibitors of nitrification, but in the 5-10 cm peat layer this proportion was 20-30%. All the inhibitors removed 96-100% of the nitrification potential in peat-water slurries from the 0-5 cm peat layer, but the 5-10 cm layer had a much lower nitrification activity, and here the efficiency of the inhibitors was more variable. Litter was the main net source of NO in the peat profile. NO3- production was lower in the litter layer than in the peat, whereas N2O production was much higher in the litter than in the peat. Denitrification was the most probable source of N2O and NO in the litter, which had a high availability of organic substrates.

Environmental controls over soil-atmosphere exchange of N2O, NO, and CO2 in a temperate Norway spruce forest. Trace gas exchange of N2O, NO, and CO2 between soil and the atmosphere was measured with high temporal resolution for 5 years (2004-2008) at the Hoglwald Forest, Germany, using a fully automated measuring system. On the basis of these long-term continuous measurements, we calculated the annual budgets of soil-atmosphere trace gas exchange with high accuracy and demonstrated substantial seasonal and interannual variations. The mean annual soil-atmosphere exchange of N2O, NO, and CO2 at our site for the years 2004-2008 was 1.20 +/- 0.09 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1), 8.64 +/- 0.19 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1), and 7.15 +/- 0.08 t CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Seasonal patterns of soil N2O fluxes were characterized by event emissions, generally occurring during thawing after longer freezing periods. In contrast to N2O emissions, the seasonal patterns of NO and CO2 soil-atmosphere exchange followed soil temperature changes, although a substantial increase in CO2 emissions was also observed during the freeze and thaw periods. The fact that NO fluxes were higher than N2O emissions during most of the entire observation period indicated that nitrification might have been the primary pathway of N-trace gas production in our study. The extremely high N2O emissions and the substantial interannual variation of N2O flux rates caused by the freeze and thaw effect demonstrate the need for long-term measurements with high temporal resolution in order to come up with more reliable estimates of soil-atmosphere trace fluxes.

Short-term effects of single or combined application of mineral N fertilizer and cattle slurry on the fluxes of radiatively active trace gases from grassland soil. After implementation of legislative measures for the reduction of environmental hazards from nitrate leaching and ammonia volatilisation when using organic manures and fertilizers in Europe, much attention is now paid to the specific effects of these fertilizers on the dynamics of global warming-relevant trace gases in soil. Particularly nitrogen fertilizers and slurTy from animal husbandry are known to play a key role for the CH(4) and N(2)O fluxes from soils. Here we report on a short-term evaluation of trace gas fluxes in grassland as affected by single or combined application of mineral fertilizer and organic manure in early spring. Methane fluxes were characterised by a short methane emission event immediately after application of cattle slurry. Within the same day methane fluxes returned to negative, and on average over the 4-day period after slurTy application, only a small but insignificant trend to reduced methane oxidation was found. Nitrous oxide emissions showed a pronounced effect of combined slurry and mineral fertilizer application. In particular fresh cattle slurry combined with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) mineral fertilizer induced an increase in mean N20 flux during the first 4 days after application from 10 to 300 mu g N(2)O-N m(-2) h(-1). (15)N analysis of emitted N(2)O from (15)N-labelled fertilizer or manure indicated that easily decomposable slurry C compounds induced a pronounced promotion of N(2)O-N emission derived from mineral CAN fertilizer. Fluxes after application of either mineral fertilizer or slurry alone showed an increase of less than 5-fold. The NO(x) sink strength of the soil was in the range of -6 to -10 mu g NO(x)-N m(-2) h(-1) and after fertilization it showed a tendency to be reduced by no more than 2 mu g NO(x)-N m(-2) h(-1), which was a result of both, increased NO emission and slightly increased NO(2) deposition. Associated determination of the N(2)O:N(2) emission ratio revealed that after mineral N application (CAN) a large proportion (c. 50 %) was emitted as N(2)O, while after application of slurry with easily decomposable C and predominantly NH(4)(+)-N serving as N-source, the N(2)O:N(2) emission ratio was 1:14, i.e. was changed in favour of N2. Our work provides evidence that particularly the combination of slurry and nitrate-containing N fertilizers gives rise to considerable N20 emissions from mineral fertilizer N pool.

Enhanced Soil Emissions of Reactive Nitrogen Gases by Fertilization and Their Impacts on Secondary Air Pollution in Eastern China. Nitrogen fertilizer application is accompanied by intense release of multiple reactive nitrogen (Nr) gases such as nitrous acid (HONO), ammonia (NH3), and nitric oxide (NO) from the soil, influencing atmospheric chemistry and air pollution. In current emission inventories, postfertilization soil emissions are poorly characterized due to inaccurate identification of fertilization timing and location. Moreover, pre-existing studies predominantly focus on individual Nr gases, and a comprehensive understanding of simultaneously emitted Nr gases from fertilization and their impacts on air quality is still limited. Here, we developed a novel method to identify the dryland fertilization activity based on satellite and reanalysis data sets. Then, we updated a dynamic soil Nr emissions model (WRF-SoilN-Chem) with lab-derived parametrization and applied it to analyze the time- and space-varying Nr emissions and their effects on air quality. It is estimated that the Nr emissions from a typical fertilization event in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region increased ozone (O3) and nitrate concentrations by 2.5 and 18.2%, respectively. HONO and NH3 emissions jointly enhanced nitrate production via gas-particle partitioning. An accurate representation of fertilization and meteorology-emission-chemistry coupled modeling would greatly improve the understanding of the soil Nr emissions and their impacts on regional air pollution.

Soil NO emissions modelling using artificial neural network. Soils are considered as an important source for NO emissions, but the uncertainty in quantifying these emissions worldwide remains large due to the lack of field experiments and high variability in time and space of environmental parameters influencing NO emissions. In this study, the development of a relationship for NO flux emission from soil with pertinent environmental parameters is proposed. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to find the best non-linear regression between NO fluxes and seven environmental variables, introduced step by step: soil surface temperature, surface water filled pore space, soil temperature at depth (20-30 cm), fertilisation rate, sand percentage in the soil, pH and wind speed. The network performance is evaluated each time a new variable is introduced in the network, i. e. each variable is justified and evaluated in improving the network performance. A resulting equation linking NO flux from soil and the seven variables is proposed, and shows to perform well with measurements (R-2 = 0.71), whereas other regression models give a poor correlation coefficient between calculation and measurements (R-2 <= 0.12 for known algorithms used at regional or global scales). ANN algorithm is shown to be a good alternative between biogeochemical and large-scale models, for future application at regional scale. C1 Lab Aerol, F-31400 Toulouse, France.

The scarcity and distribution of rainfall drove the performance (i.e., mitigation of N oxide emissions, crop yield and quality) of calcium ammonium nitrate management in a wheat crop under rainfed semiarid conditions. Selection and management of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers, including nitrification inhibitors, are considered an effective strategy to mitigate N oxide emissions, but depends strongly on soil characteristics and climatic conditions. We evaluated the effect of the use of a nitrification inhibitor (2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA)) or splitting calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) on the N oxides and CH4 emissions, yield, N use efficiency (NUE) and bread-making quality in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop. During a typical rainfall cropping season, neither splitting CAN nor using DMPSA reduced significantly the area-scaled or yield-scaled emissions in comparison to a single application of CAN without inhibitors. This could be explained by the low emissions in CAN amended plots. Conversely, in the subsequent extremely dry cropping season, higher N oxide peaks occurred after soil rewetting and the effectiveness of DMPSA was significant in these conditions (e.g. 83% mitigation for NO). No improvement in the NUE, yield or bread-making quality was achieved with a split application or DMPSA added to the fertilizer. Under the conditions of the study, splitting CAN should not be recommended from a yield-scaled emissions viewpoint, while the use of DMPSA may be encouraged due to large variability in the amount and distribution of rainfall.

Nitrous oxide and methane emissions from a vetch cropping season are changed by long-term tillage practices in a Mediterranean agroecosystem. Lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from legume-based cropping systems have encouraged their use to deliver mitigation in agricultural systems. Considerable uncertainties remain about the interaction of legumes with long-term tillage systems on GHG emissions under rainfed agroecosystems. In this context, a field experiment was undertaken under a rainfed vetch crop to evaluate the effect of three long-term tillage systems (i.e. no tillage (NT), minimum tillage (MT) and conventional tillage (CT)) on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions for 1 year. Different N2O flux patterns were observed among tillage systems during the growth period of vetch, which depended on the soil conditions favouring nitrification and denitrification. The NT system maintained a higher sink for N2O than MT and CT from January to mid-April, which significantly reduced N2O emissions at this stage. In this period, denitrification capacity and nirK gene numbers were higher for MT than NT and CT. Additionally, an increase in soil NO (3) (-) content and more favourable denitrification conditions in MT and NT than in CT for the last crop period increased N2O emissions in conservation tillage systems. Total annual N2O losses were significantly higher in MT (124.2 g N2O-N ha(-1)) than NT (51.1 g N2O-N ha(-1)) and CT (54 g N2O-N ha(-1)) in a vetch crop. Low net uptake of CH4 was observed for all tillage systems. These results suggested that long-term NT may be a better option than MT to mitigate GHG emissions in rainfed legume-cereal rotation.

Effects of land-use change and fertilization on N2O and NO fluxes, the abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying microbial communities in a hilly red soil region of southern China. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are generally interrelated in soil nitrogen biogeochemical cycles. However, the effects of land-use change and fertilization on N2O and NO fluxes and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood, especially in fields converted from rice paddies (RPs) to upland cultivation. This study investigated the effects of land-use change from RPs to a citrus orchard (OR) as well as fertilization on N2O and NO fluxes, and the gene abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying microbial communities by using static chamber-gas chromatography and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Structural equation modeling was performed to determine whether soil properties and the abundances of nitrifiers and denitrifiers influenced in situ N2O and NO fluxes. Land-use change from RPs to an OR and fertilization significantly increased N2O and NO fluxes. Land-use change increased AOA abundance, did not affect AOB abundance, and decreased nirK, nirS, and nosZ abundances. The growth of AOA and AOB abundance in response to fertilization was generally stimulated by providing more NH4+, but sometimes was inhibited by lower pH. Fertilization did not significantly affect the abundance of denitrifiers. Soil properties and functional microbial groups were explanatory variables, while land-use change altered their role in predicting in situ N2O and NO fluxes. For N2O fluxes, dissolved organic carbon was the strongest predictor in the RPs, whereas the primary explanatory factor was nirK abundance in the OR. For NO fluxes, soil temperature was the most important explanatory variable. Our results demonstrate the need for comprehensive approaches incorporating nitrifying and denitrifying processes to improve our understanding of biogeochemical cycles.

Coarse-scale soil-atmosphere NOX exchange modeling: Status and limitations. Gaseous NO and NO2 (collectively termed NOx) are trace atmospheric constituents with important functions in various atmospheric and ecosystem processes. Because nitrification and denitrification in soil are included among major sources of the gases, simulation models for predicting soil-atmosphere NOx exchange should incorporate the strong dependence of these two microbial processes on soil temperature, soil water content, and substrate N availability. We briefly review current understanding of these controls, then describe how various authors have incorporated that knowledge into model parameterization schemes, and finally present some general thoughts regarding how well those schemes work and what might be missing. Existing coarse-scale models have evolved to the point that they are beginning to explicitly address the influences, interactions, and dynamics of all three microscale controllers in formulations suitable for studies at regional to global and seasonal to interannual scales. Perhaps the greatest limitation of the models, as well as their predictor variables, is that they often fail to account for the large pulse of gaseous N oxide emissions commonly observed following wetting of very dry soil. This failure is exacerbated by mounting evidence that similar pulses may occur following sudden removal of other environmental limitations on microbial growth and metabolism. Such pulses ostensibly make a large contribution to soil-atmosphere NOx exchange, especially in semi-arid, subhumid, and seasonally dry tropical regions of the globe where the exchange has been poorly characterized despite being subject to intense anthropogenic disturbance.

In regions where mean annual precipitation (MAP) is under 500 mm yr(-1), we find that NO2 and NH3 VCDs are positively related to monthly precipitation, and where MAP is between 500 and 1,750 mm yr(-1) or higher, NO2 VCDs are negatively related to monthly precipitation. In dry ecoregions, temperature and precipitation were important predictors of NH3 and NO2 VCDs, likely related to variation in soil emissions. In mesic ecoregions, monthly NO2 VCDs were strongly related to burned area, suggesting that biomass burning drives seasonality. NH3 VCDs in mesic ecoregions were positively related to both monthly temperature and monthly carbon monoxide (CO) VCDs, suggesting that a mixture of soil and biomass burning emissions influenced NH3 seasonality. In northern mesic ecoregions, monthly temperature explained most of the variance in monthly NH3 VCDs, suggesting that soil sources, including animal excreta, determined NH3 seasonality. In southern mesic ecoregions, monthly CO VCDs explained more variation in NH3 VCDs than temperature, suggesting that biomass burning may have greater influence over NH3 seasonality.

Gaseous emissions of nitrogen from grazed pastures: Processes, measurements and modelling, environmental implications, and mitigation. Grazing-managed pasture is a major system of livestock production in many countries. Grazed pastures receive large inputs of nitrogen (N), derived from biological fixation of atmospheric N, through the addition of manures and fertilizers, and the deposition of animal excreta. However, only a small proportion of the N ( < 15%) consumed by grazing animals is converted to milk or live weight gain, the reminder is excreted. Loss of N occurs mainly through ammonia (NH3) volatilization, release of gaseous N such as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) through biological denitrification, and nitrate (NOD leaching, which has both economical and environmental implications. Nitrogen is an important plant nutrient and its loss affects both the quality and quantity of feed, thereby leading to poor animal production. Recently there have been increasing concerns about the environmental impacts of N loss through leaching (i.e., methaemoglobinaemia) and gaseous emission (i.e., greenhouse gas). In this chapter, the various sources of N input to grazed pasture are discussed in relation to the dynamics of N, the measurement and modelling gaseous emissions of N, and the implications of gaseous emission in relation to economic loss and environmental degradation. The dynamics of N transformations in soil-plant system with particular emphasis on the biochemistry of gaseous emission, and the measurement techniques and the use of process-based models to predict gaseous emissions are discussed. The practical implications of gaseous emission are discussed in relation to acid rain and climate change (i.e., the Kyoto Protocol). Grazing and farm management practices to mitigate gaseous emissions are highlighted. (C) 2004 by Elsevier Inc. C1 Massey Univ, Inst Nat Resources, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

Soil emissions of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide from no-till corn. Fertilized agricultural soils can be a significant source of emissions of NO and N2O into the atmosphere. This study was conducted to determine the influence of N rate on the emissions of these gases in a no-till corn (Zea mays L.) crop grown in western Tennessee. The influence of N rate was assessed for a 210-d period on replicated plots receiving 0, 140, and 252 kg N ha(-1) (0N, 140N, and 252N) as ammonium nitrate (AN). Plots were located on a Routon silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, thermic Typic Ochraqualf) at the West Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station in Jackson, TN. Gas fluxes were measured by static chamber boxes located on plots. The measurement technique was automated and replicate chamber estimates were made eight times daily for the entire study period. Fertilizer application significantly affected both NO and N2O emission rates. The cumulative N2O-N lost from the fertilizer treatments was from 10 to 20-fold that of NO. On an areal basis, the 140N treatment emitted 4.23 kg N2O-N and 0.19 kg ha(-1) of NO-N whereas the 252N treatment emitted 6.56 kg N2O-N and 0.50 kg ha(-1) NO-N. Soil parameters of water-filled pore space (WFPS), NO3- and NH4+, were correlated with N2O emissions but only soil NO3- was correlated with NO flux. Our data, and more recent data in the literature, suggest that N2O emissions from fertilized soil may be considerably higher than previously thought. Emissions of N2O were 2.6 to 3.0% of the fertilizer amounts applied. These higher emissions may, in part, explain some of the reason for the shortfall in the global N2O budget. ", "Processes leading to N2O and NO emissions from two different Chinese soils under different soil moisture contents. Processes leading to N2O and NO emissions from two different Chinese soils under different soil moisture contents. Great attention has been paid to N2O emissions from paddy soils under summer rice-winter wheat double-crop rotation, while less focus was given to the NO emissions. Besides, neither mechanism is completely understood. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the relative importance of nitrification and denitrification to N2O and NO emissions from the two soils at different soil moisture contents N2O and NO emissions during one winter wheat season were simultaneously measured in situ in two rice-wheat based field plots at two different locations in Jiangsu Province, China. One soil was neutral in pH with silt loam texture (NSL), the other soil alkaline in pH with a clay texture (AC). A (15) N tracer incubation experiment was conducted in the laboratory to evaluate the relative importance of nitrification and denitrification for N2O and NO emissions at soil moisture contents of 40 % water holding capacity (WHC), 65 % WHC and 90 % WHC. Higher N2O emission rates in the AC soil than in the NSL soil were found both in the field and in the laboratory experiments; however, the differences in N2O emissions between AC soil and NSL soil were smaller in the field than in the laboratory. In the latter experiment, nitrification was observed to be the more important source of N2O emissions (> 70 %) than denitrification, regardless of the soils and moisture treatments, with the only exception of the AC soil at 90 % WHC, at which the contributions of nitrification and denitrification to N2O emissions were comparable. The ratios of NO/N2O also supported the evidence that the nitrification process was the dominant source of N2O and NO both in situ and in the laboratory. The proportion of nitrified N emitted as N2O (P (N2O) ) in NSL soil were around 0.02 % in all three moisture treatments, however, P (N2O) in the AC soil (0.04 % to 0.10 %) tended to decrease with increasing soil moisture content. Our results suggest that N2O emission rates obtained from laboratory incubation experiments are not suitable for the estimation of the true amount of N2O fluxes on a field scale. Besides, the variations of P (N2O) with soil property and soil moisture content should be taken into account in model simulations of N2O emission from soils.

THE FATE OF SPRING APPLIED FERTILIZER-N DURING THE AUTUMN-WINTER PERIOD - COMPARISON BETWEEN WINTER-FALLOW AND GREEN MANURE CROPPED SOIL. A field experiment was carried out at a pilot plot that was cropped with oilseed rape, and then left partly fallow and partly cropped with a green manure (mustard) during the autumn after harvest of the oilseed rape. The rape residues were incorporated in the soil. Methods used to quantify the N fluxes from harvest until sowing of the next crop were (1) N-15 balance method, (2) total mineral N analysis and (3) NO emission measurements. Losses of spring applied fertilizer N were negligible in cropped plots and minimal in fallow plots during the following autumn-winter period. Most of the plant-N residues was retained by the organic N pool of the upper 30-cm soil layer. The green manure contributed slightly to soil available N at sowing of the next crop. However, the incorporation of plant material resulted in a nitrate flux that was at risk of leaching on the fallow plots, and on the green manure plots after incorporation of the green manure. This nitrate was largely derived from soil organic N, not from unused fertilizer applied in spring or from immobilized fertilizer. The NO emissions from the green manure plots were significantly higher than emissions from the fallow plots. The plants had a stimulating effect on the NO emission. A relationship between the NO emission and the soil nitrate concentration could not be established. No emissions were measured after green manure incorporation due to the low temperatures at the pilot plot. However, a greenhouse experiment showed an increased emission after incorporation. The NO emissions seemed to be related with the soil ammonium concentration. C1 FED INST AGR RES CHANGINS,CH-1260 NYON,SWITZERLAND.

Nitric oxide emission from a Norway spruce forest floor. Although the available data on soil NO emission are increasing, only few measurements have been made in temperate forests. Emissions from these forests are generally low, but recent studies have shown that NO emission from N-affected forests can be much higher. In this study the emission of NO from the door of a moderately N-affected. Norway spruce forest in Denmark was measured using dynamic chambers during two seasons (April 1995 and September 1995). At the same time, fluxes of CO2 and NO2, soil water content inside and outside the chambers, soil temperature at 10 cm depth, soil surface temperature and air temperature were, recorded. The emission of NO in April was low (< 0.3 ng N m(-2) s(-1)), whereas it was significantly higher in September (21 ng N (-2) s(-1) with a range 0-82 ng N m(-2) s(-1)). In April the soil surface temperature was low (< 6\"C) and the soil moisture was high (26% vol/vol). In September the soil surface temperature was high (16 degrees C) and soil moisture was significantly lower (14% vol/vol) than in April. There was a high correlation between CO2 emission and NO emission. The fluxes of NO2 were very small and not related to NO emission. Generally, the variation within a single plot was small, whereas the variation between plots was large. About half of the total variation of NO emission in September could be explained by a combination of soil moisture, distance to tree trunks, and moss cover. No significant relationship could be found between NO emission and soil surface temperature or soil temperature. Other parameters such as the C/N dynamics in the soil must be taken into account to provide a better mechanistic understanding of the NO emission. An annual emission of 3.15 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1) was estimated by the amount of NH4+ in throughfall. Compared to most of the previous published measurements of NO emission from temperate forest soils, the values presented here are high and of the same magnitude as found in N-affected forests in Central Europe.

Reactive Nitrogen Hotspots Related to Microscale Heterogeneity in Biological Soil Crusts. Biocrusts covering drylands account for major fractions of terrestrial biological nitrogen fixation and release large amounts of gaseous reactive nitrogen (Nr) as nitrous acid (HONO) and nitric oxide (NO). Recent investigations suggested that aerobic and anaerobic microbial nitrogen transformations occur simultaneously upon desiccation of biocrusts, but the spatio-temporal distribution of seemingly contradictory processes remained unclear. Here, we explore small-scale gradients in chemical concentrations related to structural characteristics and organism distribution. X-ray microtomography and fluorescence microscopy revealed mixed pore size structures, where photo-autotrophs and cyanobacterial polysaccharides clustered irregularly in the uppermost millimeter. Microsensor measurements showed strong gradients of pH, oxygen, and nitrite, nitrate, and ammonium ion concentrations at micrometer scales in both vertical and lateral directions. Initial oxygen saturation was mostly low (& SIM;30%) at full water holding capacity, suggesting widely anoxic conditions, and increased rapidly upon desiccation. Nitrite concentrations (& SIM;6 to 800 mu M) and pH values (similar to 6.5 to 9.5) were highest around 70% WHC. During further desiccation they decreased, while emissions of HONO and NO increased, reaching maximum values around 20% WHC. Our results illustrate simultaneous, spatially separated aerobic and anaerobic nitrogen transformations, which are critical for Nr emissions, but might be impacted by future global change and land management.

Nitrogen trace gas emissions from a riparian ecosystem in southern Appalachia. In this paper, we present two years of seasonal nitric oxide (NO), ammonia (NH3), and nitrous oxide (N2O) trace gas fluxes measured in a recovering riparian zone with cattle excluded and adjacent riparian zone grazed by cattle. In the recovering riparian zone, average NO, NH3, and N2O fluxes were 5.8, 2.0, and 76.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) (1.83, 0.63, and 24.19 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), respectively. Fluxes in the grazed riparian zone were larger, especially for NO and NH3, measuring 9.1, 4.3, and 77.6 ngN m(-2) s(-1) (2.87, 1.35, and 24.50 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) for NO, NH3, and N2O, respectively. On average, N2O accounted for greater than 85% of total trace gas flux in both the recovering and grazed riparian zones, though N2O fluxes were highly variable temporally. In the recovering riparian zone, variability in seasonal average fluxes was explained by variability in soil nitrogen (N) concentrations. Nitric oxide flux was positively correlated with soil ammonium (NH4+) concentration, while N2O flux was positively correlated with soil nitrate (NO3-) concentration. Ammonia flux was positively correlated with the ratio of NH4+ to NO3-. In the grazed riparian zone, average NH3 and N2O fluxes were not correlated with soil temperature, N concentrations, or moisture. This was likely due to high variability in soil microsite conditions related to cattle effects such as compaction and N input. Nitric oxide flux in the grazed riparian zone was positively correlated with soil temperature and NO3- concentration. Restoration appeared to significantly affect NO flux, which increased approximate to600% during the first year following restoration and decreased during the second year to levels encountered at the onset of restoration. By comparing the ratio of total trace gas flux to soil N concentration, we show that the restored riparian zone is likely more efficient than the grazed riparian zone at diverting upper-soil N from the receiving stream to the atmosphere. This is likely due to the recovery of microbiological communities following changes in soil physical characteristics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sources and Sinks of Trace Gases in Amazonia and the Cerrado. Data for trace gas fluxes (NOx, N2O, and CH4) from the Amazon and cerrado region are presented with focus on the processes of production and consumption of these trace gases in soils and how they may be changed because of land use changes in both regions. Fluxes are controlled by seasonality, soil moisture, soil texture, topography, and fine-root dynamics. Compared to Amazonian forests where the rapid cycling of nitrogen supports large emissions of N2O, nitrification rates and soil emissions of N oxide gases in the cerrado region are very low. Several studies report CH4 consumption during both wet and dry seasons in forest soils, but there is occasionally net production of CH4 during the wet season. A few studies suggest an unknown source of CH4 from upland forests. As with N oxide emissions, there are few data on CH4 emissions from cerrado soils, but CH4 consumption occurs during both wet and dry seasons. Clearing natural vegetation, burning, fertilization of agricultural lands, intensive cattle ranching, and increasing dominance by legume species in areas under secondary succession after land conversion have all been identified as causes of increasing N2O and NO emissions from tropical regions. Large uncertainties remain for regional estimates of trace gas fluxes. Improvement of models for the N oxides and CH4 fluxes for Amazonia and the cerrado still depends upon gathering more data from sites more widely distributed across two vast biomes and more importantly on basic theory about the controls of emissions from the ecosystem to the atmosphere.

Effect of Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizers on Nitrous Oxide Emissions and Crop Yields: A Meta-analysis. Enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) have the potential to reduce N2O emissions and improve crop productivity, but the impact of soil and management conditions on their effectiveness is not clear. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of different EEF types in reducing N2O emissions in three cereal production systems: rice (Oryza sativa L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We also compared EEF efficacy across soil and management conditions for corn and wheat systems. Results showed that the effect of EEFs on N2O emissions and crop yields varied greatly with their modes of action, soil types, and management conditions. Nitrification inhibitors (NIs), double inhibitors (DIs: urease plus nitrification inhibitors), and controlled-release N fertilizers (CRFs) consistently reduced N2O emissions compared with conventional N fertilizers across soil and management conditions (grand mean decreases of 38, 30, and 19%, respectively). The Dls more effectively reduced N2O emissions in alkaline soils than did Nls, but the trend was reversed in acidic soils. Urease inhibitors also reduced N2O emissions compared with conventional N fertilizers in coarse-textured soils and irrigated systems. Overall crop yields increased by 7% with the addition of Nls alone. Compared with conventional N fertilizers, Dls also increased crop yields in alkaline soils, coarse-textured soils, and irrigated systems. However, CRFs had no effect on crop yields. Overall, this study suggests that Nls or Dls can reduce N2O emissions while improving crop yields. Growers should select EEFs based on their soil and management conditions to maximize their effectiveness.

N2O emissions during the freezing and thawing periods from six fields in a livestock farm, southern Hokkaido, Japan. In many countries, high nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions have been observed during soil freezing and thawing periods. Quantification of those emissions is crucial to evaluate annual N2O emissions. For this study, we measured N2O and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes along with soil N2O concentrations at a corn (Zea mays L.) field and five grasslands (Phalaris arundinacea L. and Phleum pratense L.) during a winter-spring period in southern Hokkaido, Japan. We also measured denitrification activities of the soils from those sites. During the observation period, the soils froze to a maximum depth of 370 mm under saturated conditions and the lowest soil temperature at a 50 mm depth was -4.5 degrees C. After 6 March 2005, daily air temperature rose above 0 degrees C, but the soil temperature remained approximately 0 degrees C for about two weeks. These two weeks were defined as the \"transition period,'' while the periods before and after the transition period were defined as the \"freezing'' and the \"thawing'' periods, respectively. During the freezing and transition periods, N2O concentration increased in the frozen soils relative to the unfrozen soils, and the highest values were observed in the frozen soils during the transition period. During the thawing period, the N2O concentration in the soils decreased. N2O emissions were much higher during the thawing period than during the freezing and transition periods, and remarkably higher N2O emissions were observed at the corn site compared to those at the grassland sites. NO emissions were also observed during the thawing period but at much lower levels than N2O emissions at all the sites. N2O-N/NO-N ratio exceeded one at all the sites during the entire period, indicating N2O production through denitrification. At the corn site, denitrification activity was much lower and N2O/(N2O+N-2) was much higher than at the grasslands. The result indicated that high N2O emissions at the corn site were caused by complementary processes: (1) high accumulated N2O through denitrification in the frozen soil during the freezing and transition periods, and (2) low N2O reduction rate during the thawing period.

Unexpected results of a pilot throughfall exclusion experiment on soil emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, and NO in eastern Amazonia. The eastern Amazon Basin may become drier as a result of less regional recirculation of water in a largely deforested landscape and because of increased frequency and intensity of El Nino events induced by global warming. Drier conditions may affect several plant and soil microbial processes, including soil emissions of CO2, CH4, NO, and N2O. We report here unanticipated results of a pilot study that was initiated to test the feasibility of a larger-scale throughfall exclusion experiment. In particular, soil drying caused a switch from net consumption of atmospheric CH4 by soils in the control plot to net CH4 emission from soils in the experimentally dried plot. This result is surprising because production of CH4 requires anaerobic microsites, which are uncommon in dry soil. A plausible explanation for increased CH4 emissions in the dried plot is that dry soil conditions favor termite activity and increased coarse root mortality provides them with a substrate. Another surprise was,that both NO and N2O fluxes were elevated several years after initiation of the drying experiment. Apparently, a pulse of N availability caused by experimental drying persisted for at least 3 years. As expected, CO2 emissions were lower in the dried plots, which is consistent with lower rates of root growth observed in root in-growth cores placed in the dried plots. More work is needed to test these explanations and to confirm these phenomena, but these results demonstrate that changes in climate could have unanticipated effects on biogeochemical processes in soils that we do not adequately understand.

EFFECTS OF SOIL VARIABLES AND SEASON ON THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF NITRIC-OXIDE IN OXIC SOILS. NO production rates, NO uptake rate constants, NO compensation points, and different soil variables were determined for various soil types and different soil horizons, and checked for mutual correlations. NO production was detected in all, and NO comsuption in most soils tested. Only soils in a very early state of soil genesis showed no NO consumption activity. NO consumption was positively correlated with soil water and NH4+ contents. NO production rates were not correlated with any soil variable. Both NO production and NO consumption tended to decrease from the upper organic to the deeper mineral horizons in different climax soils. The seasonal variation of NO production and NO consumption in a calcic cambisol and a luvisol showed highest rates in summer. The rates of NO production and NO consumption were correlated with a few of the soil variables, but showed no uniform, theoretically comprehensible pattern. However, NO production in samples of the calcic cambisol was stimulated by fertilization with NH4+, but not with NO3- and was inhibited by nitrapyrin, indicating that NO was produced by nitrification. NO production made up about 3% of the nitrification rates. In the luvisol, in contrast, NO production was not affected by the addition of NH4+ or NO3-. Nitrification was also undetectable in this acidic soil, except for a few patches where NO production was also detected. C1 MAX PLANCK INST MIKROBIOL,KARL VON FRISCH STR,W-3550 MARBURG,GERMANY.

Agriculture is a major source of NOx pollution in California. Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are a primary component of air pollution-a leading cause of premature death in humans and biodiversity declines worldwide. Although regulatory policies in California have successfully limited transportation sources of NOx pollution, several of the United States' worst-air quality districts remain in rural regions of the state. Site-based findings suggest that NOx emissions from California's agricultural soils could contribute to air quality issues; however, a statewide estimate is hitherto lacking. We show that agricultural soils are a dominant source of NOx pollution in California, with especially high soil NOx emissions from the state's Central Valley region. We base our conclusion on two independent approaches: (i) a bottom-up spatial model of soil NOx emissions and (ii) top-down airborne observations of atmospheric NOx concentrations over the San Joaquin Valley. These approaches point to a large, overlooked NOx source from cropland soil, which is estimated to increase the NOx budget by 20 to 51%. These estimates are consistent with previous studies of point-scale measurements of NOx emissions from the soil. Our results highlight opportunities to limit NOx emissions from agriculture by investing in management practices that will bring co-benefits to the economy, ecosystems, and human health in rural areas of California.

A review of chemical reactions of nitrification intermediates and their role in nitrogen cycling and nitrogen trace gas formation in soil. Soil is a major source of nitrogen trace gases (NTGs). Microbial denitrification has long been identified as a source of NTGs under reducing conditions, whereas the production of NTGs during nitrification is far from being completely understood. This review updates information about the role of abiotic processes in the formation of gaseous N products in soil and brings attention to the potential interplay of microbial and chemical soil processes that tend to be neglected in research on NTG emissions. Several reactions that involve the nitrification intermediates, nitrite (NO2-) and hydroxylamine (NH2OH), are known to produce the NTGs nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). These abiotic reactions are: the self-decomposition of NO2-, reactions of NO2- with reduced metal cations, nitrosation of soil organic matter (SOM) by NO2-, the reaction between NO2- and NH2OH, and the oxidation of NH2OH by Fe3+ or MnO2. These reactions can occur over a broad range of soil characteristics, but they are disregarded in most current research on NTG studies in favour of biological processes only. Relatively few studies have tried to quantify the contribution of abiotic processes to total NTG emissions, which results in uncertainty in emission models and mitigation strategies. It is difficult to discriminate between biological and abiotic sources because both processes can proceed at the same time in the same soil layer. The potential of stable isotope techniques to disentangle the different processes in soil and to constrain budgets of atmospheric NTGs better are highlighted. Recent advances in stable isotope technologies, such as infrared real-time laser spectroscopy, provide considerable potential for both natural abundance and tracer studies in this field.

Measuring the nitrogen isotope compositions (delta N-15) of nitric oxide (NO) from different sources helps to quantify the relative contributions of atmospheric NOx. Soil is one of the most important sources of atmospheric NOx, but only limited measurements on the delta N-15 of soil-emitted NO exist, hampering our ability to partition sources to air pollution. Here we conducted soil incubations to measure the delta N-15-NO under defined aerobic or anaerobic conditions, favoring either nitrification or denitrification. Soils were collected from seven sites spanning three ecosystems in northern China (two agricultural, two forest, and three grassland sites). We found that the delta N-15-NO and their associated N isotope fractionations were significantly different between anaerobic and aerobic conditions in seven soils. Under aerobic condition, the delta N-15-NO ranged from -62 parts per thousand to -50 parts per thousand (averaged -56 +/- 4 parts per thousand), being significantly more negative (by 23 parts per thousand) than those under anaerobic condition (-45 parts per thousand to -23 parts per thousand, averaged -33 +/- 7 parts per thousand). The apparent N isotope fractionation for NO production under aerobic condition ((15)epsilon(aerobic) = 61 +/- 3 parts per thousand) was significantly higher (by 26 parts per thousand) than under anaerobic condition ((15)epsilon(anaerobic) = 35 +/- 6 parts per thousand), with a small variability among ecosystem types. Our study demonstrates that the delta N-15-NO from different soils are very different from fuel combustions (mainly from 0 parts per thousand to +20 parts per thousand), supporting that measuring(15)N is a useful tool to partition the contributions of soil NO to atmospheric NOx. Our results also imply delta N-15-NO produced by nitrification and denitrification distinctly different, as these two processes are dominant processes producing NO under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively.

Temporal Patterns of N2O Fluxes From a Rainfed Maize Field in Northeast China. Rainfed agriculture is one of the most common farming practices in the world and is vulnerable to global climate change. However, only limited studies have been conducted on rainfed agriculture, mainly using low-frequency manual techniques, which caused large uncertainties in estimating annual N2O emissions. In this study, we used a fully automated system to continuously measure soil N2O emissions for two years (April 2017 to March 2019) in a typical rainfed maize field in Northeast China. The annual N2O emissions were 2.8 kg N ha(-1) in year 1 (April 2017 to March 2018) and 1.8 kg N ha(-1) in year 2 (April 2018 to March 2019), accounting for 1.9 and 1.2% of the nitrogen fertilizer applied, respectively. The inter-annual variability was mainly due to different weather conditions encountered in years 1 and 2. A severe drought in year 1 reduced plant N uptake, leaving high mineral N in the soil, and the following moderate rainfalls promoted a large amount of N2O emissions. The seasonal pattern of N2O fluxes was mainly controlled by soil temperature and soil nitrate concentration. Both soil moisture and the molar ratio of NO/N2O indicate that N2O and NO were mainly derived from nitrification, resulting in a significant positive correlation between N2O and NO flux in the intra-rows (where nitrogen fertilizer was applied). Moreover, we observed that the N2O emissions during the freeze-thaw periods were negligible in this region for rainfed agriculture. Our long-term and high-resolution measurements of soil N2O emissions suggest that sampling between LST 9:00 and 10:00 is the best empirical sampling time for the intermittent manual measurements.
