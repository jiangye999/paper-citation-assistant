AB Nitrous oxide emission (N2O) from applied fertilizer across the different agricultural landscapes especially those of rainfed area is extremely variable (both spatially and temporally), thus posing the greatest challenge to researchers, modelers, and policy makers to accurately predict N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions from a rainfed, maize-planted, black soil (Udic Mollisols) were monitored in the Harbin State Key Agroecological Experimental Station (Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China). The four treatments were: a bare soil amended with no N (C0) or with 225 kg N ha(-1) (CN), and maize (Zea mays L.)-planted soils fertilized with no N (P0) or with 225 kg N ha(-1) (PN). Nitrous oxide emissions significantly (P < 0.05) increased from 141 +/- 5 g N2O-N ha(-1) (C0) to 570 +/- 33 g N2O-N ha(-1) (CN) in unplanted soil, and from 209 +/- 29 g N2O-N ha(-1) (P0) to 884 +/- 45 g N2O-N ha(-1) (PN) in planted soil. Approximately 75 % of N2O emissions were from fertilizer N applied and the emission factor (EF) of applied fertilizer N as N2O in unplanted and planted soils was 0.19 and 0.30 %, respectively. The presence of maize crop significantly (P < 0.05) increased the N2O emission by 55 % in the N-fertilized soil but not in the N-unfertilized soil. There was a significant (P < 0.05) interaction effect of fertilization x maize on N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide fluxes were significantly affected by soil moisture and soil temperature (P < 0.05), with the temperature sensitivity of 1.73-2.24, which together explained 62-76 % of seasonal variation in N2O fluxes. Our results demonstrated that N2O emissions from rainfed arable black soils in Northeast China primarily depended on the application of fertilizer N; however, the EF of fertilizer N as N2O was low, probably due to low precipitation and soil moisture.

AB As maize requires a high input of fertilizer nitrogen, it is likely to be an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O). Detailed information on N2O emissions over long time periods, and management practices that aim to reduce N2O emissions from spring maize fields in China is lacking. Consequently we measured the emissions of N2O from a spring maize field continuously from 2007 to 2009 at Yuci, Shanxi Province, China using newly developed automated chambers and explored strategies to reduce N2O emissions. The results showed that the Optimal fertilizer treatment (120 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) produced the same yield of grain as the Traditional fertilizer treatment (330 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), and significantly reduced N2O emissions by 48%. Topdressing with urea was the main source of N2O, which on average accounted for 58% of the total N2O emissions each year. Uptake of N2O occurred during the late stage of maize growth when soil mineral N content was less than 46.4 mg N kg(-1) soil. The N2O emission factors were lower than the IPCC default value. Nitrous oxide emissions could also be reduced if farmers did not apply fertilizer N during periods of heavy rainfall and did not irrigate immediately after fertilization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Crop growth is a key factor that effects nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in farmland soil. Clarification and quantification of the impact of maize growth on N2O emission are important to guide maize planting and patterns, which is also useful for building model to simulate N2O emission in an agroecosystem. In this study, we carried out a three-year (2013-2015) field experiment to evaluate the contribution of maize growth on N2O emission using a split-plot design. The factors included planting versus not planting maize, and four rates of nitrogen (N) application (0, 150, 300, 450 kg N/ha). Our results showed the impacts of maize growth on N2O emission decreased linearly with the growth of maize from the 43rd day after sowing (y = -1.07x + 26.85, R-2 = 0.95). Nitrogen fertilizer application can reduce the impacts of maize growth on N2O emission. The impact of maize growth on soil NH4+- N and NO3-- N are similar to N2O emission, and they have a strong correlation. We concluded that maize growth reduces soil N2O emission but N application can exert an antagonistic effect, and the impact of maize growth on soil NH4+-N and NO3-- N largely determines the impacts of maize growth on N2O emission.

AB Many studies have focused on various agricultural management measures to reduce agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. However, few studies have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems in the North China Plain. Thus, we conducted a field experiment to compare N2O emissions under monoculture and maize-legume intercropping systems. In 2010, five treatments, including monocultured maize (M), maize-peanut (MP), maize-alfalfa (MA), maize-soybean (MS), and maize-sweet clover (MSC) intercropping were designed to investigate this issue using the static chamber technique. In 2011, M, MP, and MS remained, and monocultured peanuts (P) and soybean (S) were added to the trial. The results showed that total production of N2O from different treatments ranged from (0.87 +/- 0.12) to (1.17 +/- 0.11) kg ha(-1) in 2010, while those ranged from (3.35 +/- 0.30) to (9.10 +/- 2.09) kg ha(-1) in 2011. MA and MSC had no significant effect on soil N2O production compared to that of M (P<0.05). Cumulative N2O emissions from MP in 2010 were significantly lower than those from M, but the result was the opposite in 2011 (P<0.05). MS significantly reduced soil N2O emissions by 25.55 and 48.84% in 2010 and 2011, respectively (P<0.05). Soil N2O emissions were significantly correlated with soil water content, soil temperature, nitrification potential, soil NH4+, and soil NO3- content (R-2=0.160-0.764, P<0.01). A stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that soil N2O release was mainly controlled by the interaction between soil moisture and soil NO3- content (R-2=0.828, P<0.001). These results indicate that MS had a coincident effect on soil N2O flux and significantly reduced soil N2O production compared to that of M over two growing seasons.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were measured from an irrigated sandy-clay loam cropped to maize and wheat, each receiving urea at 100 kg N ha(-1) During the maize season (24 August-26 October), N2O emissions ranged between -0.94 and 1.53 g N ha(-1) h(-1) with peaks during different irrigation cycles (four) ranging between 0.08 and 1.53 g N ha(-1) h(-1). N2O sink activity during the maize season was recorded on 10 of the 29 sampling occasions and ranged between 0.18 and 0.94 g N ha(-1) h(-1). N2O emissions during the wheat season (22 November-20 April) Varied between -0.85 and 3.27 g N ha(-1) h(-1), whereas peaks during different irrigation cycles (six) were in the range of 0.05 - 3.27 g N ha(-1) h(-1). N2O sink activity was recorded on 14 of the 41 samplings during the wheat season and ranged between 0.01 and 0.87 g N ha(-1) h(-1). Total N2O emissions were 0.16 and 0.49 kg N ha(-1), whereas the total N2O sink activity was 0.04 and 0.06 kg N ha(-1) during the maize and wheat seasons, respectively. N2O emissions under maize were significantly correlated with denitrification rate and soil NO3--N but not with soil NH4+- or soil temperature. Under wheat, however, N2O emissions showed a strong correlation with soil NH4+-N, soil NO3--N and soil temperature but not with the denitrification rate. Under either crop, N2O emissions did not shaw a significant relationship with water-filled pore space or soil respiration.

AB Crop straw returning has become a prevailing cultivation practice in the vast area of the North China Plain (NCP), while few investigations about its influence on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission have been conducted, In this study, N2O emissions from an agricultural field in the NCP with and without straw returning were comparably investigated by using static chambers in two consecutive maize-wheat growing seasons from June 2010 to June 2012. Compared with the NP treatment (compound nitrogen fertilizer only), the cumulative N2O emission from the SP treatment (compound nitrogen fertilizer plus straw) increased about 150% during the maize season in 2010, but decreased by about 35% during the maize season in 2011. The inconsistent influence of straw returning on N2O emission from the maize field was ascribed to the evidently different soil moisture between the two years, which was further confirmed by laboratory simulation experiments. About 40% reduction of N2O emission from the SP treatment during the two winter wheat seasons, which was mainly attributed to anoxic condition induced by rotting the maize straw.

AB Maize (Zea mays L.), a staple crop in the North China Plain, contributing substantially to agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in this region. Many studies have focused on various agricultural management measures to reduce N2O emissions. However, few have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems. In the current study, we investigate whether maize-soybean intercropping treatments could reduce N2O emission rates. Two differently configured maize-soybean intercropping treatments, 2:2 intercropping (two rows of maize and two rows of soybean, 2M2S) and 2:1 intercropping (two rows of maize and one row of soybean, 2M1S), and monocultured maize (M) and soybean (S) treatments were performed using a static chamber method. The results showed no distinct yield advantage for the intercropping systems. The total N2O production from the various treatments was 0.15 +/- 0.04-113.85 +/- 12.75 mu g m(-2) min(-1). The cumulative N2O emission from the M treatment was 16.9 +/- 2.3 kg ha(-1) over the entire growing season (three and a half months), which was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the 2M2S and 2M1S treatments by 36.6% and 32.2%, respectively. Two applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (as urea) at 240 kg N ha(-1) each induced considerable soil N2O fluxes. Short-term N2O emissions (within one week after each of the two N applications) accounted for 74.4%-83.3% of the total emissions. Soil moisture, temperature, and inorganic N were significantly correlated with soil N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.246-0.365, n = 192, P < 0.001). Soil nitrate (NO3-) and moisture decreased in the intercropping treatments during the growing season. These results indicate that maize-soybean intercropping can reduce soil N-2O emissions relative to monocultured maize.

AB In the face of climate change, quantification of the emission of nitrous oxide from soils in relation to sufficient N availability for crop uptake has assumed much significance. This study used the N-15 stable isotope technique, under controlled laboratory conditions, to quantify the interactive effect on and relative contributions of the component species to N2O emission and mineral N dynamics in a tropical luvisol incorporated with different rates of cowpea-maize residue mixtures. The results show that increasing the maize residue proportion in the mixture significantly decreases N2O emission compared to the sole cowpea incorporation but increases mineral N concentration compared to sole maize residue incorporation. It is concluded that mixing low C:N ratio cowpea residue with high C:N ratio maize residue has potential for N management in tropical legume-cereal intercropping systems with the view to minimizing N2O emission while making N available for crop uptake.

AB Little information is available on the effects of urease inhibitor, N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), and nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from fluvo-aquic soil in the North China Plain. A field experiment was conducted at the Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station, Henan Province, China, to study the influence of urea added with NBPT, DCD, and combination of both NBPT and DCD on N2O emissions during the maize growing season in 2009. Two peaks of N2O fluxes occurred during the maize growing season: the small one following irrigation and the big one after nitrogen (N) fertilizer application. There was a significant positive relationship between In [N2O flux] and soil moisture during the maize growing season excluding the 11-day datasets after N fertilizer application, indicating that N2O flux was affected by soil moisture. Mean N2O flux was the highest in the control with urea alone, while the application of urea together with NBPT, DCD, and NBPT + DCD significantly lowered the mean N2O flux. Total N2O emission in the NBPT + DCD, DCD, NBPT, and urea alone treatments during the experimental period was 0.41, 0.47, 0.48, and 0.77 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively. Application of urea with NBPT, DCD, and NBPT + DCD reduced N2O emission by 37.7%, 39.0%, and 46.8%, respectively, over urea alone. Based on our findings, the combination of DCD and NBPT together with urea may reduce N2O emission and improve the maize yield from fluvo-aquic soil in the North China Plain.

AB Here, we report on a two-years field experiment aimed at the quantification of the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) from the dominant wheat maize double cropping system in North China Plain. The experiment had 6 different fertilization strategies, including a control treatment, recommended fertilization, with and without straw and manure applications, and nitrification inhibitor and slow release urea. Application of N fertilizer slightly decreased CH4 uptake by soil. Direct N2O emissions derived from recommended urea application was 0.39% of the annual urea-N input. Both straw and manure had relatively low N2O emissions factors. Slow release urea had a relatively high emission factor. Addition of nitrification inhibitor reduced N2O emission by 55%. We conclude that use of nitrification inhibitors is a promising strategy for N2O mitigation for the intensive wheat maize double cropping systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Crop management and soil properties affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cropping systems. Irrigation is one of the agronomical management practices that deeply affects soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Careful management of irrigation, also concerning to soil type, might mitigate the emissions of this powerful GHG from agricultural soils. In the Mediterranean area, despite the relevance of the agricultural sector to the overall economy and sustainable development, the topic of N2O emissions does not have the same importance as N2O fluxes in temperate agricultural areas. Only some research has discussed N2O emissions from Mediterranean cropping systems. Therefore, in this study, N2O emissions from different soil types (sandy-loam and clay soils) were analyzed in relation to the irrigation of a maize crop grown in two contrasting seasons (2009-2010). The irrigation was done using a center pivot irrigation system about twice a week. The N2O emissions were monitored throughout the two-years of maize crop growth. The emissions were measured with the accumulation technique using eight static chambers (four chambers per site). Nitrogen fertilizer was applied in the form of ammonium sulphate and urea with 3,4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) nitrification inhibitors. In 2009, the N2O emissions and crop biomass measured in both soil types were lower than those measured in 2010. This situation was a lower amount of water and nitrogen (N) available to the crop. In 2010, the N2O fluxes were higher in the clay site than those in the sandy-loam site after the first fertilization, whereas an opposite trend was found after the second fertilization. The soil temperature, N content, and soil humidity were the main drivers for N2O emission during 2009, whereas during 2010, only the N content and soil humidity affected the nitrous oxide emissions. The research has demonstrated that crop water management deeply affects soil N2O emissions, acting differently for denitrification and nitrification. The soil properties affect N2O emission by influencing the microclimate conditions in the root zone, conditioning the N2O production.

AB Soil nitrate (NO3) can be especially susceptible to leaching and denitrification in late spring under maize (Zea mays L.) production. This study examined the effects of tillage (untilled; tilled), fertilizer application (full season rate or starter-only at planting), rotation (maize after orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L); continuous maize), and soil type (clay loam; loamy fine sand) on short-term nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions after a 50-mm late-spring simulated precipitation event. N2O emissions were measured daily for a week following the event. Soil NO3, temperature, physical properties and total N were also measured. N2O emissions peaked on the second day after a simulated rainfall event for all treatments. N2O losses were significantly higher on the clay loam compared to the loamy sand. Full season fertilizer application at planting on untilled soil resulted in 4.7 and 2.3 kg N ha(-1) greater cumulative N2O losses than starter-only fertilizer application on maize-after-grass and continuous maize, respectively. Under tilled conditions, cumulative N2O losses over a week averaged 0.88 kg N ha(-1) greater for the full fertilizer application compared to the starter-only application. Higher N2O losses from untilled soil were related to lower soil porosity and higher bulk density, and higher emissions under maize-after-grass were correlated with higher soil C levels. In conclusion, untilled soil and sod-based crop rotations increase late-spring N2O losses under maize production, especially with early fertilization. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Maize is a major irrigated crop in Mediterranean areas and its typical intensive management may impact soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. In these irrigated continuous maize systems, the legumes incorporation as well as adjusted nitrogen (N) fertilization might be interesting strategies to reduce soil N2O emissions. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of cropping diversification and different N rates on soil N2O emissions in flooded irrigated maize under Mediterranean conditions. To achieve this, two cropping systems (maize monoculture system, MC; and pea -maize rotation, MP) and 3N rates (unfertilized, 0N; medium rate, MN; and high rate, HN) were evaluated in a field experiment established in NE Spain during 2 years (2019; 2020). During the studied period, the N rate had a significant effect on soil N2O emissions, with a non-linear positive response of cumulative soil N2O emissions to N rates. In both systems, quick and high increases of soil N2O fluxes were observed immediately after the N application reaching 55 and 100 mg N2O-N m(-2) day(-1) in MC and MP, respectively. Both years, the pea phase of the MP rotation showed greater cumulative N2O emissions than the fallow of MC. However, N2O losses in the maize phase were similar (2019) or even higher (2020) in MC than in MP. Moreover, in both seasons, the MN treatments showed lower yield-scaled N2O emissions and N emission factor than the HN treatments, being this last lower than 1% in all cases. The results obtained showed that in irrigated Mediterranean conditions the replacement of a fallow by a legume, together with an adjusted N fertilization are favourable strategies to mitigate soil N2O emissions in high-yielding maize systems.

AB Metals, including copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn), are associated with nitrous oxide (N2O) production processes, such as nitrification and denitrification. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of Cu, Fe, and Zn on N2O emissions and to determine cumulative N2O emission and crop yields from upland soils. Metals were applied at a rate of 20 kg ha(-1) in upland soil supporting maize (Zea mays L.) growth in 2018 and 2019. While the mean value of cumulative N2O emissions across both years was 5.19 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1) for the control soil, those of soil treated with Cu, Fe, and Zn were 3.37, 2.48, and 4.82 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Ammonium (NH4+) concentration in soil was highest after Fe application, and nitrate (NO3-) concentration was lowest. The copy number of the amoA gene related to NH4+ oxidation was lowest after Fe enhancement, implying that nitrification was inhibited. Furthermore, N2O emission decreased with Cu addition because the copy number of the nosZ gene associated with N2O reduction to N-2 was the highest. Because Cu and Fe decreased yield-scaled N2O emission, the application of either metal could reduce N2O emission per unit area of maize production, suggesting that both metals are beneficial soil amendments for reducing N2O emissions while maintaining maize yield.

AB Static chamber method has been used to monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from agricultural soils. When monitoring GHG emission in rice or wheat systems, all the plant stems can be covered in the top chamber. Under this situation, both nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from the root free soils and the root area soils can be estimated. However, in maize field, most of the studies placed the chamber within the maize row due to the difficulty to cover the whole maize stalk. N2O emission from the root area was not estimated since the majority of maize roots were excluded in the chamber. This may lead to a under estimation of global N2O emission from maize cultivation. To evaluate the spatial variability of N2O emission from maize field, a two-year field experiment was conducted. N2O emissions from three sampling sites including inter-rows, within-rows and root area were monitored under five different fertilization regimes. Results showed that chamber placement site had a significant effect on the N2O emission during the maize growing season. Placing the chamber in inter-rows either overestimated or underestimated N2O emission. In 2018, N2O emission rate in the inter-rows was 69 % higher than the root area on average of the five treatments; whereas, in 2020, N2O emission rate in the inter-rows was 2.5 times lower than the root area. N fertilization regimes had a significant effect on N2O emission. On average of chamber sites, N2O emission under N fertilizer broadcasting was around 2 times lower compared to nest-applied. The highest N2O emission rate was observed when both basal and dressing N fertilizer were applied in a nest, which was 1.1-3.2 times higher than the other N fertilizer placement regimes. The N2O emission rate from the within-rows was close to the average value of the three sampling sites. Our results suggested that placing chamber in the center of two neighboring maize plants could represent the average area-scaled N2O emission in maize field.

AB To investigate the impact of different forms of plant-derived organic matter on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, an incubation experiment with the same rate of total nitrogen (N) application was carried out at 25 degrees C for 250 days. Soils were incorporated with maize-derived organic matter (i. e., maize residuederived dissolved organic matter and maize residues with different C/N ratios) and an inorganic N fertilizer (urea). The pattern and magnitude of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were affected by the form of N applied. Single application of maize-derived organic matter resulted in a higher N2O emission than single application of the inorganic N fertilizer or combined application of the inorganic N fertilizer and maize-derived organic matter. The positive effect of maize residue-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) addition on N2O emissions was relatively short-lived and mainly occurred at the early stage following DOM addition. In contrast, the positive effect induced by maize residue addition was more pronounced and lasted for a longer period. Single application of maize residues resulted in a substantial decrease in soil nitric nitrogen (NO3- -N), but it did not affect the production of N2O. No significant relationship between N2O emission and NO3--N and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) suggested that the availability of soil N was not limiting the production of N2O in our study. The key factors affecting soil N2O emission were the soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and metabolism quotient (qCO(2)). Both of them could explain 87% of the variation in cumulative N2O emission. The C/N ratio of maizederived organic matter was a poor predictor of N2O emission when the soil was not limited by easily available C and the available N content met the microbial N demands for nitrification and denitrification. The results suggested that the magnitude of N2O emission was determined by the impact of organic amendments on soil C availability and microbial activity rather than on soil N availability. In agricultural management practices, if the N inputs from organic and inorganic N fertilizers are equivalent, addition of organic N fertilizers that contain high amounts of available C will result in a higher N2O emission.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) emissions from an agricultural field in the North China Plain were compared for three treatments during a whole maize growing period from 26 June to 11 October, 2012. Compared with the control treatment (without fertilization, designated as CK), remarkable pulse emissions of N2O, NO and NH3 were observed from the normal fertilization treatment (designated as NP) just after fertilization, whereas only N2O and NH3 pulse emissions were evident from the nitrification inhibitor treatment (designated as ND). The reduction proportions of N2O and NO emissions from the ND treatment compared to those from the NP treatment during the whole maize growing period were 31% and 100%, respectively. A measurable increase of NH3 emission from the ND treatment was found with a cumulative NH3 emission of 3.8 +/- 1.2 kg N/ha, which was 1.4 times greater than that from the NP treatment (2.7 +/- 0.7 kg N/ha).

AB Biochar application is a promising approach to decrease nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils, yet little is known about how biochar affects N2O-producing and consuming microbial processes under changing field conditions. We conducted a field study to assess if growing season patterns in soil N2O emissions were correlated with the underlying microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification. We measured soil N2O emissions, potential nitrification and denitrification rates, and the abundance of key soil nitrogen (N)-cycling functional genes in an intensive maize production field trial in Illinois, USA that included the following four treatments: Control (unamended), Biochar (100 Mg ha(-1)), Nitrogen (269 kg N ha(-1) as Urea Ammonium Nitrate fertilizer), and Biochar + Nitrogen (100 Mg ha(-1) and 269 kg N ha(-1), respectively). Biochar increased potential nitrification rates when soil ammonium concentrations were high following fertilizer application, thus enhancing N2O emissions in the Biochar + Nitrogen treatment early in the season which were likely nitrification associated. However, over the full growing season, biochar application reduced cumulative N2O emissions in Biochar + Nitrogen plots to levels similar to the unamended Control. This could be attributed to biochar suppression of potential denitrification throughout the growing season. The treatments amended with biochar avoided large pulses of N2O emissions following intense rain events in the mid-season, while also sustaining lower N2O emissions in the late-season. Our study demonstrates that biochar can have dynamic effects on soil N2O emissions and the underlying microbial processes that depend on changing edaphic conditions, such as soil inorganic nitrogen availability and moisture, over the growing season.

AB The agricultural sector is responsible for substantial amounts of greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate climate change. Such greenhouse gas emissions from upland crops are difficult to abate because they are dominated by nitrous oxide (N2O) production from soil processes. Strategies to reduce these emissions focus on N fertilizer management, and there is a widespread assumption that legume crops, which do not receive N fertilizer, emit little N2O. Here we show that this assumption is incorrect; approximately 40% of N2O emissions from the most extensive cropping system in North America-the maize-soybean rotation-occur during the soybean phase. Yet, due to the lack of N fertilizer input, opportunities for emissions abatement from the soybean phase are unclear. Using models of cropping systems, we developed a strategy that combines cover-crop management and earlier planting of extended growth soybean varieties to reduce emissions from soybean production by 33%. These practices, which complement N fertilizer management in maize, are widely accessible and represent an immediate, climate-smart strategy to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from soybean production, thus not only contributing to climate-change mitigation but also maintaining productivity while adapting to changing weather patterns.
   Soil processes involved in agricultural practices emit considerable levels of nitrous oxide, which detrimentally contribute to climate change. This study explores strategies to reduce nitrous oxide emissions while maintaining crop productivity in the US maize-soybean rotational cropping system.

AB In this study, we investigated N2O emissions from two fields under minimum tillage, cropped with maize (MT maize) and summer oats (MT oats), and a conventionally tilled field cropped with maize (CT maize). Nitrous oxide losses from the MT maize and MT oats fields (5.27 and 3.64 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively) were significantly higher than those from the CT maize field (0.27 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) over a period of 1 year. The lower moisture content in CT maize (43% water-filled pore space [WFPS] compared to 60 -65%) probably caused the difference in total N2O emissions. Denitrification was found to be the major source of N2O loss. Emission factors calculated from the MT field data were high (0.04) compared to the CT field (0.001). All data were simulated with the denitrification decomposition model (DNDC). For the CT field, N2O and N2O+N-2 emissions were largely overestimated. For the MT fields, there was a better agreement with the total N2O and N2O+N-2 emissions, although the N2O emissions from the MT maize field were underestimated. The simulated N2O emissions were particularly influenced by fertilization, but several other measured N2O emission peaks associated with other management practices at higher WFPS were not captured by the model. Several mismatches between simulated and measured NH4+, NO3-and WFPS for all fields were observed. These mismatches together with the insensitivity of the DNDC model for increased N2O emissions at the management practices different from fertilizer application explain the limited similarity between the simulated and measured N2O emissions pattern from the MT fields.

AB Irrigation and soil management can impact soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Flood and sprinkler irrigation systems together with conventional tillage are the main practices used in the high yielding maize systems in Mediterranean Spain. The objective of this field work was to quantify the effect of the irrigation system (i.e., flood, F; and sprinkler, S) and the soil tillage system (i.e., conventional tillage, CT; no-tillage maintaining the maize stover, NTr; and no-tillage removing the maize stover, NT) on the N2O emissions from the soil during 3 yr (2015, 2016, and 2017). S irrigation, with mean values of 1.35 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) throughout the 3 yr, obtained 42% lower N2O emissions than F irrigation. On average of the three growing seasons, yield-scaled N2O emissions by grain yield and by grain N uptake in F irrigation were two-fold higher than in S irrigation. Moreover, in one out of three growing seasons (2017), no-tillage systems (i.e., NTr and NT) showed greater yield-scaled N2O emissions compared with CT. The higher maize grain yield with the S irrigation compared to F irrigation, as well as the lower N2O emissions reported under S irrigation resulted in the reduction of the yield-scaled N2O emissions. Our findings highlight the role of sprinkler irrigation decreasing N2O emissions in comparison to flood irrigation in Mediterranean agroecosystems.

AB To study the effects of maize plants on nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from a dryland experimental farm, in situ soil profiles of N2O concentrations and surface emissions were investigated in a field experiment from 2014 to 2015 in the semiarid areas of northwestern China. The experiment included four treatments: unplanted and N-unfertilized soil (C0), unplanted soil fertilized with 225 kg N ha(-1) (CN), maize-planted and N-unfertilized soil (P0), and maize-planted soil fertilized with 225 kg N ha(-1) (PN). Surface N2O emissions and soil N2O concentrations at depths of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cm were measured weekly. Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased the soil N2O concentrations and surface emissions. Compared to the unplanted soil, the presence of maize plants significantly decreased the N2O concentrations at depths of 10-40 cm during the maize growing season. The modeled N2O fluxes at a depth of 10 cm presented a similar pattern to the chamber measurements. However, there was a discrepancy between the concentration gradient and chamber methods when the fluxes were high, mainly because the gradient method could not detect N2O production and consumption process above the uppermost gas sampler (0-10 cm). Soil moisture and temperature were critical factors affecting the N2O concentrations and surface emissions. The respective cumulative surface emissions and effluxes at a depth of 10 cm during the maize growing season (PN treatment) were decreased by 8.9 and 17.9% in 2014 and by 14.7 and 17.5% in 2015 compared to values of the CN treatment. This was mainly due to the decrease in soil moisture caused by the growth of the maize plants, which resulted in a soil condition less suitable for N2O production.

AB In order to explore the effects of nitrapyrin (N-Serve) application on greenhouse gas emission and nitrogen (N) leaching of a waterlogged maize (Zea mays L.) field, we investigated the effects of applying nitrapyrin on soil ammonium (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) content, nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and the warming potential (GWP(N2O)) in a waterlogged maize field. The design included three treatments: waterlogging treatment with only urea application (V-3WL), waterlogging treatment with urea and nitrapyrin application (V-3WL+N), and no waterlogging treatment applying only urea (CK). Our results revealed that waterlogging led to the increase of nitrate concentrations across the soil profile, thus potentially increasing N leaching and decreasing N use efficiency. The accumulated N2O emissions increased significantly in waterlogged plots compared to control plots, and maximum N2O emission fluxes occurred during the process of soil drying after waterlogging; this resulted in an increase in GWP(N2O) and N2O greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI(N2O)) by 299% and 504%, respectively, compared to those of CK. However, nitrapyrin application was able to reduce N2O emissions. Nitrapyrin application was also good for decreasing GWP(N2O) and GHGI(N2O) by 34% and 50%, respectively, compared to V-3WL. In addition, nitrapyrin application was conducive to reduce N leaching and improve N use efficiency, resulting in a yield increase by 34%, compared to that of V-3WL. The application of nitrapyrin helped to mitigate agriculture-source greenhouse effects and N leaching induced by waterlogging, and was a high N-efficient fertilizer method for a waterlogged field.

AB A challenge for agriculture is to individuate strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from soil while preserving crop yield. Agricultural practices are reported to affect carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from soil due to their effects on nutrient cycling and soil conditions (e.g. soil water content, soil temperature etc.). A field campaign was carried out to measure the effect of reducing irrigation level (drip irrigation, rainfed) and N fertilizer rate (170 kg N ha(-1), 130 kg N ha(-1), 0 kg N ha(-1)) on GHG emissions from soil and on crop yield on maize cultivated in Tuscany region (Italy). Main result highlighted that decreasing N fertilization of about 20% reduced cumulative N2O emissions (on average -42%) without decreasing the crop productivity, indicating that improving the N use efficiency could be the best strategy to reduce GHG emissions from soil cultivated with maize in our environment.

AB About half of the applied nitrogen (N) is not consumed by crops, causing environmental and economic costs. This N can be lost as ammonia (NH3) volatilization, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission or leaching, among others. This work aimed to compare the amount of gaseous N losses using three different fertilizers on two consecutive experiments: one summer crop (maize) and one winter crop (wheat) in the Rolling Pampa, Argentina. The fertilizers used were urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and AN+DMPP (ammonium nitrate-based NPK fertilizer with DMPP nitrification inhibitor). NH3 emissions were estimated using a semi open-static absorption system during the first month after fertilization for each experiment. N2O emissions were estimated using vented static chambers during the growing season of each crop. Results show that CAN or AN+DMPP fertilizers used instead of UAN helped to reduce NH3 volatilization by 45-50% and 62-63% on maize and wheat experiments respectively, but failed to reduce N2O emissions. In addition, contrary to the expected, AN+DMPP increased N2O emissions during the maize experiment. The majority of the gaseous N losses occurred at specific moments of the crop cycle (after N fertilization and around leaf senescence). Losses as NH3 volatilization were higher than N2O emissions in the maize experiment, as expected because of the warmer temperature during this summer crop. However, N2O emissions were higher during the wheat crop, emphasizing the importance of factors such as meteorological conditions, previous land-use, residual soil nitrate and stubble quality on the soil.

AB We quantified the soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes of five soil fertility management practices (inorganic fertilizer (Mf), maize residue + inorganic fertilizer (RMf), maize residue + inorganic fertilizer + goat manure (RMfM), maize residue + tithonia diversifolia + goat manure (RTiM), and a control (CtC)) in Kenya's central highlands using a static chamber method from March 2019 to March 2020. The cumulative annual soil CH4 uptake ranged from -1.07 to -0.64 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1), CO2 emissions from 4.59 to 9.01 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1), and N2O fluxes from 104 to 279 g N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1). The RTiM produced the highest CO2 emissions (9.01 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)), carbon sequestration (3.99 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1)), yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSE) (0.043 g N2O-N kg(-1) grain yield), the lowest net global warming potential (net GWP) (-14.7 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1)) and greenhouse gas intensities (GHGI) (-2.81 Kg CO2-eq kg(-1) grain yield). We observed average maize grain yields of 7.98 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) under RMfM treatment. Integrating inorganic fertilizer and maize residue retention resulted in low emissions, increased soil organic carbon sequestration, and high maize yields.

AB Crop residues incorporated in soil are a potentially important source of nitrous oxide (N2O), though poorly quantified. Here, we report on the N2O emission from 10 crop residues added to a sandy and a clay soil, both with and without additional nitrate (NO3). In the sandy soil, total N2O emission from wheat, maize, and barley residues was not significantly different from the control. The total N2O emission from white cabbage, Brussels sprouts, mustard, sugar beet residues and broccoli ranged from 0.13 to 14.6% of the amount of N added as residue and were higher with additional NO than without additional NO. In the clay soil, similar effects of crop residues were found, but the magnitude of the N2O emission was much smaller than that in the sandy soil: less than 1 % of the residue N evolved as N2O. The C-to-N ratio of the residue accounted for only 22-34% and the mineralizable N content of the residue for 18-74% of the variance in N2O emission. We suggest that the current IPCC methodology for estimating N2O emission from crop residues may be considerably improved by defining crop specific emission factors instead of one emission factor for all crop residues.

AB Biochar applied to soil can reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions produced by freeze-thaw processes. Nonetheless, how biochar modification affects N2O emissions during freeze-thaw cycles is not completely clear. In our research, during freeze-thaw cycles, microcosm experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of maize straw biochar (MB) or rice straw biochar (RB) addition on soil N2O emissions under different water conditions. The N2O emissions peaked at the initial stage of thawing in all the soils, and the total N2O emissions were considerably greater in the flooded soils than in the nonflooded soils. Compared with the soils without biochar addition, RB and MB amendments inhibited N2O emissions by 69 and 67%, respectively. Moreover, after biochar addition, the abundance of AOB amoA genes decreased by 9-13%. Biochar addition significantly decreased the content of microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) in flooded soil during thawing, which was significantly correlated with N2O emissions and nitrification and denitrification communities. The PLS-PM further revealed that biochar can inhibit the production and emission of soil N2O by reducing soil MBN during soil thawing. In addition, soil moisture directly significantly affects N2O emissions and indirectly affects N2O emissions through its influence on soil physicochemical properties. Our results revealed the important function of biochar in decreasing the emission of N2O in flooded soil during freeze-thaw cycles.

AB Solar greenhouse vegetable fields have been found to be hotspots of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in China, mainly due to excessive manure application and irrigation. Pulses of N2O emissions have been commonly reported by field monitoring works conducted in greenhouse fields, though their significance regarding total N2O emissions and the driving mechanism behind them remain poorly understood. N2O fluxes were monitored in situ using a static opaque chamber method in a typical greenhouse vegetable field. Then, laboratory incubations were conducted under different soil moisture and manure application gradients to monitor nitrous oxide emissions and related soil properties, using a robotized incubation system. Field monitoring showed that the occurrence of clear N2O emission bursts closely followed fertilization and irrigation events, accounting for 76.7% of the annual N2O efflux. The soil N2O flux increased exponentially with the water-filled pore space (WFPS), causing extremely high N2O emissions when the WFPS was higher than 60%. During the lab incubation, emission bursts led to N2O peaks within 40 h, synchronously changing with the transit soil NO2-. An integrated analysis of the variations in the gas emission and soil properties indicated that the denitrification of transit NO2- accumulation was the major explanation for N2O emission bursts in the greenhouse filed. Nitrous oxide emission bursts constituted the major portion of the N2O emissions in the Chinese greenhouse soils. Nitrite (NO2-) denitrification triggered by fertilization and irrigation was responsible for these N2O emission pulses. Our results clarified the significance and biogeochemical mechanisms of N2O burst emissions; this knowledge could help us to devise and enact sounder N2O mitigation measures, which would be conducive to sustainable development in vegetable greenhouse fields.

AB Many studies show that N2O can be produced in the soil (nitrification and denitrification) and then easily emitted from the soil surface. There are indications that plants are able to release water dissolved N2O (CHANG et al. 1997). Therefore, the transport of N2O via the transpiration flow was investigated in sunflower and maize. For this purpose, the nutrient solution in the root compartment of a hydroponical system was enriched with a definite amount of N2O. The separate shoot compartment was aerated with a constant flow of ambient air. Changes in N2O concentrations between inlet and outlet of the shoot compartment were continuously measured. During the light period a release of N2O with the transpired water was measured in sunflower plants, but no N2O emissions were found in maize.

AB Maize production requires a large amount of nitrogen (N). However, a greater part of the N used gets lost to the environment as reactive forms including nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O emissions and associated soil-related factors were measured in a maize (Zea mays L.) field in the 5(th) crop after initiation of the experiment in an annual maize-rice sequence. The treatments comprised two levels of crop residues (no residue, NR vs. 30 cm residue, CR) with four levels of N fertilizers (control; farmers' practice, FP; national recommended dose, RD, and 125% of RD, 1.25 RD). Mean and cumulative N2O emissions increased with N rate coupled with either residue level. The CR coupled with 1.25 RD had 10% higher N2O emissions than the same rate as NR. In contrast, yield-scaled N2O emissions were equal in 1.25 RD coupled with either residue level. However, higher N2O emissions in CR than in NR can be offset by the corresponding improvement in soil elemental quality, e.g. soil organic carbon, total N, P, K and S. The N2O emission factor, ranged from 0.99 to 1.34, and was higher in CR coupled with 1.25 RD than in any other combination suggesting that optimization of N rate is one of the best options to reduce N2O emissions. Maize grain yield was higher in RD and 1.25 RD than in the farmers' practice where the former two were similar to each other. Step-wise multiple regression showed that N application rate, soil organic carbon, total N and pH are the dominant factors controlling N2O emissions. Our results suggest that maize production can benefit from residue retention with the current N rate (RD) for better yield, soil quality and N2O mitigation.

AB Nitrogen amendment followed by flooding irrigation is a general management practice fora wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain, which may favor nitrification and denitrification. Consequently, high emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are hypothesized to occur. To test this hypothesis, we performed year-round field measurements of N2O and NO fluxes from irrigated wheat-maize fields on a calcareous soil applied with all crop residues using a static, opaque chamber measuring system. To interpret the field data, laboratory experiments using intact soil cores with added carbon (glucose) and nitrogen (nitrate, ammonium) substrates were performed. Our field measurements showed that pulse emissions after fertilization and irrigation/rainfall contributed to 73% and 88% of the annual N2O and NO emissions, respectively. Soil moisture and mineral nitrogen contents significantly affected the emissions of both gases. Annual emissions from fields fertilized at the conventional rate (600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) totaled 4.0 +/- 0.2 and 3.0 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively, while those from unfertilized fields were much lower (0.5 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.4 +/- 0.05 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Direct emission factors (EF(d)s) of N2O and NO for the fertilizer nitrogen were estimated to be 0.59 +/- 0.04% and 0.44 +/- 0.04%, respectively. By summarizing the results of our study and others, we recommended specific EF(d)s (N2O: 0.54 +/- 0.09%; NO: 0.45 +/- 0.04%) for estimating emissions from irrigated croplands on calcareous soils with organic carbon ranging from 5 to 16 g kg(-1). Nitrification dominated the processes driving the emissions of both gases following fertilization. It was evident that insufficient available carbon limited microbial denitrification and thus N2O emission. This implicates that efforts to enhance carbon sink in calcareous soils likely increase their N2O emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a high spatial variation in N2O emission from agricultural fields and N2O emissions from fields cultivated with stalk-crops was generally measured in the interrow area. The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in seasonal N2O emissions between interrow soil and interrow + row soil, and to understand the effect of different fertilizers on N2O emissions in a maize-cultivated sandy loam soil in the North China Plain. The experiment included five treatments: organic manure (OM), half-organic manure N plus half fertilizer N (HOM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NK (NK) and control (CK). Cumulative N2O emission from interrow + row soil during the maize growth season was 0.84-122 kg N ha(-1) with an average of 0.98 kg N ha(-1) in the N-fertilized treatments, significantly higher than the 0.30-0.49 kg N ha(-1) from interrow soil. However, no significant difference was observed in the CK treatment. The measurement in interrow soil underestimated N2O emissions by 44-67%. This difference mainly occurred at the two peak emission periods following fertilizer application probably due to discrepancy in soil denitrification potential. Manure application more efficiently increased difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil than inorganic N fertilizer application. The higher NO concentration did not induce larger N2O emission from interrow soil in the NK treatment than in the NPK treatment, but did from interrow + row soil, resulting in greater difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil. It is suggested that measuring N2O emission solely from interrow soil could underestimate seasonal N2O emissions, and partly mask the effect of N fertilizer application rates on N2O emission in a maize-cultivated soil in the North China Plain.

AB Biogeochemical processes regulating cropland soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are complex, and the controlling factors need to be better understood, especially for seasonal variation after fertilization. Seasonal patterns of N2O emissions and abundances of archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), bacterial amoA, nitrate reductase (narG), nitrite reductase (nirS/nirK), and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) genes in long-term fertilized wheat-maize soils have been studied to understand the roles of microbes in N2O emissions. The results showed that fertilization greatly stimulated N2O emission with higher values in pig manure-treated soil (OM, 2.88kgNha(-1)year(-1)) than in straw-returned (CRNPK, 0.79kgNha(-1)year(-1)) and mineral fertilizer-treated (NPK, 0.90kgNha(-1)year(-1)) soils. Most (52.2-88.9%) cumulative N2O emissions occurred within 3weeks after fertilization. Meanwhile, N2O emissions within 3weeks after fertilization showed a positive correlation with narG gene copy number and a negative correlation with soil NO3- contents. The abundances of narG and nosZ genes had larger direct effects (1.06) than ammonium oxidizers (0.42) on N2O emissions according to partial least squares path modeling. Stepwise multiple regression also showed that log narG was a predictor variable for N2O emissions. This study suggested that denitrification was the major process responsible for N2O emissions within 3weeks after fertilization. During the remaining period of crop growth, insufficient N substrate and low temperature became the primary limiting factors for N2O emission according to the results of the regression models.

AB The winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain is a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to high nitrogen (N) fertilizer and irrigation water inputs. However, a detailed understanding of the contribution of N2O production sources is still limited because of the complexity of N2O generation in soils and a lack of relevant field studies. Moreover, the efficiency and mechanisms of N2O mitigation approaches in this area, i.e. the use of nitrification inhibitors, remains poorly understood. To elucidate the N2O production pathways from this rotation system and to evaluate the effect of a widely used nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on mitigating N2O emissions, we monitored N2O fluxes and analyzed isotopomer ratios of soil-emitted N2O during one rotation year. Results indicate that the application of DMPP significantly reduced N2O emissions by 67% in the winter wheat season and 47% in the summer maize season. Isotopomer analysis revealed that in the N-fertilized treatment, nitrification and/or fungal denitrification accounted for up to 36% of the N2O emission peaks observed after fertilization and irrigation events, whereas the nitrifier denitrification pathway was likely to be the major source, accounting for the remaining N2O emissions. The high effectiveness of the nitrification inhibitor on mitigating N2O emissions at high soil moisture may be attributed to the dual inhibitory effect on nitrifier denitrification, i.e. reducing the supply of nitrite, which is the substrate of nitrifier denitrification and inhibiting ammonia-oxidizing bacteria activities, which carry nitrifier denitrification.

AB Animal manure application is widely recognized for its agronomic benefits in enhancing soil fertility and crop productivity through organic matter enrichment and nutrient supply, but the critical application time governing its greenhouse gas emission trade-offs remains unresolved. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of pig manure compost application timing on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and maize yields in Northeast China through a four-year field experiment. The treatments included: (1) inorganic fertilizers (NPK); (2) NPK plus pig manure compost applied in spring (NPK-MS); and (3) NPK plus pig manure compost applied in autumn (NPK-MA). The N2O fluxes, NH4+-N contents, NO3--N contents, and maize yields were analyzed. The results showed that compared with NPK, NPK-MA increased N2O emissions by 44.4%. Applying pig manure compost in autumn promotes N2O emissions during the freeze-thaw period. However, there was no significant effect of NPK-MS on N2O emissions compared with NPK (p > 0.05). Spring-applied manure compost (NPK-MS) resulted in an 11.9% increase in maize yield compared to NPK. In contrast, autumn-applied manure compost (NPK-MA) did not significantly affect maize yield (p > 0.05). Furthermore, yield-scaled N2O emissions were significantly increased in NPK-MA (p < 0.05). Overall, spring application of pig manure compost is recommended for increasing maize yield without significantly increasing N2O emissions while in Northeast China.

AB Soil N2O emissions were monitored throughout a 3-year crop rotation including maize, fennel and a ryegrass-clover sward, at Borgo Cioffi NitroEurope site. N2O emission rates were highly variable in time and space and controlled by soil nitrogen and soil water content. The N2O effluxes were low for most of the monitored period. The highest N2O emissions were recorded throughout the 2007 maize cropping season, ranged form 15.2 to 196.2 mu g m(-2) h(-1) whereas the lowest ones ranged form -5 to 10 mu g m(-2) h(-1) during the 2007-2008 ryegrass-clover winter crop. For the maize crops, N2O peaks were detected after fertilization but with a delay of some weeks from applications, probably due to the presence of DMPP nitrification inhibitor in the applied fertilizer. A properly designed ANOVA model was developed to explain the influence of the main chemical-physical factors. This model also allowed the quantification of the delay time in peak emissions following fertilization, which resulted variable over the years and ranged between 2 and 21 days. A dependence of emissions from soil temperature and moisture was found, with significant interactions in some instances. Calculated Emission Factors (maize 2007: 0.48%; ryegrass-clover sward 2007-2008: 0.05%; maize 2008: 0.14%; fennel: 0.28% 2008-2009; maize 2009: 0.015%) resulted well below the values reported in the literature and the 1% reference value indicated by IPCC, probably due to a sub-optimal water regime inducing low Water Filled Pore Space (WFPS) values.

AB Contemporary crop production faces dual challenges of increasing crop yield while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emission. An integrated evaluation of the mitigation potential of yield-scaled nitrous oxide ( N2O) emission by adjusting cropping practices can benefit the innovation of climate smart cropping. This study conducted a meta-analysis to assess the impact of cropping systems and soil management practices on area-and yield-scaled N2O emissions during wheat and maize growing seasons in China. Results showed that the yield-scaled N2O emissions of winter wheat-upland crops rotation and single spring maize systems were respectively 64.6% and 40.2% lower than that of winter wheat-rice and summer maize-upland crops rotation systems. Compared to conventional N fertilizer, application of nitrification inhibitors and controlled-release fertilizers significantly decreased yield-scaled N2O emission by 41.7% and 22.0%, respectively. Crop straw returning showed no significant impacts on area-and yield-scaled N2O emissions. The effect of manure on yield-scaled N2O emission highly depended on its application mode. No tillage significantly increased the yield-scaled N2O emission as compared to conventional tillage. The above findings demonstrate that there is great potential to increase wheat and maize yields with lower N2O emissions through innovative cropping technique in China.

AB In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the most important staple crop is maize; the production of which is dominated by smallholder farming systems using low external inputs (<10 kg N ha(-1)) resulting in low crop yields and large yield gaps (difference between actual and potential yields). To assess increases in soil N2O emissions when closing maize yield gaps by increased fertilizer use, we reviewed the literature, developed a relationship between yield gaps and soil N2O emissions, and used it to scale across SSA. According to our analysis, N2O emissions from maize production will increase from currently 255 to 1755 1226 Gg N2O-N year(-1) (+589%) if existing maize yield gaps are closed by 75%, increasing total anthropogenic N2O emissions for SSA by c. 50%.

AB A 2-year field study was conducted to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) in a rain-fed spring maize cropland in the Loess Plateau, P. R. China, and to determine the effects of optimized nitrogen (N) fertilization practices on urea-derived N2O emission factor (EF), grain yield, net greenhouse gas (NGHG) emission, and net greenhouse gas intensity (NGHGI). Five treatments were considered, including control (CK), conventional N fertilization (Con), optimal N fertilization (Opt), optimal N fertilization plus nitrification inhibitor (Opt+DCD), and optimal N fertilization with slow release urea (Opt+SR). Soil acted as a small sink for atmospheric CH4. Nitrogen fertilization and heavy rainfall events (>40mm) were the main factors controlling N2O emissions. The annual mean EF ranged from 0.12 to 0.55%. Compared to conventional N fertilizer, nitrification inhibitor decreased the annual cumulative N2O, NGHG, and NGHGI emissions by 45, 52, and 48%, respectively, without decreasing grain yield. In conclusion, nitrification inhibitor addition was the most effective practice to reduce N2O emissions in the rain-fed regions of Loess Plateau.

AB The Centre for Agriculture and environment (CLM) has developed 'enviromental performance indicators' (EPIs) for the nitrogen surplus and the emission of nitrous oxide. The EPI for the nitrogen surplus is an element of the yardstick for mineral accounting while the other is used int he yardstick for energy accounting. the nitrogen surplus is calculated using farm figures for inputs and outputs of nitrogen. For the emission of nitrous oxide from soils, two calculation methods have been developed, i.e. a simple and a complex method. Calculation of both EPIs has been carried out for energy cropping and for dairy farming. For energy crops, nitrogen surplus ranges from 58 kg nitrogen per ha for hemp to 196 kg nitrogen per ha for silage maize (reference crop: 40 kg nitrogen per ha). For the emission of nitrous oxide, both methods lead to similar results, ranging form 0.7 kg N2O-N per ha for miscanthus to 4.0 kg N2O-N per ha for silage maize (reference: 0.9 kg N2O-N per ha). For dairy farming, nitrous oxide is emitted directly from fertilisation of soils, including artificial fertiliser and manure, from grazing and indirectly from the purchase of cattle feed cultivated elsewhere. Total emission of nitrous oxide from dairy farms ranges from 3.5 kg N2O-N per ha to 18.9 kg N2O-N per ha. The major contribution comes from fertilisation, while emissions from using deposition and purchase of cattle feed only add relatively small amounts. It was concluded that the complex method is more suitable to calculate the emission of nitrous oxide from soils. Mineral and energy accounting show that nitrogen surplus and emissions of nitrous oxide may be substantially reduced by improvements in nitrogen management. More research is needed to assess emission factors for nitrous oxide, and to develop management practices to reduce the emissions.

AB Aims Process-based biogeochemical models can be used to simulate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and maize yields and draw insights on yields improvement and climate change mitigation options. We compared both observed and DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) simulated soil N2O fluxes and maize yields. Methods We used DNDC model to simulate soil N2O fluxes and maize yields under four soil fertility treatments (inorganic fertiliser, animal manure, animal manure + inorganic fertiliser and control,) replicated thrice for 1 year in Central Highlands of Kenya. We sampled soil N2O fluxes using static chambers installed in each plot. We analysed soil N2O using gas chromatography and calculated cumulative fluxes using trapezoidal rule linear interpolation between sampling dates. Results DNDC showed poor results in simulating daily N2O fluxes (157.16% <= normalised root mean square error (nRMSE) <= 324.01% and 0.90 <= modelling efficiency (NSE) <= 0.96), good to excellent performance in simulating cumulative annual soil N2O fluxes (6.16 <= nRMSE <= 12.86 and 0.63 <= NSE <= 0.86) and good to excellent performance in simulating maize yields (1.15% <= nRMSE <= 13.86% and 0.51 <= NSE <= 0.88) across all soil fertility treatments. Conclusion The DNDC model had good to excellent performance in simulating cumulative soil N2O fluxes and crop yields across treatments. Though the model captured yield-scaled N2O fluxes and N2O emission factors across treatments, they were underestimated under manure treatment. There is a need to continue calibrating the DNDC model for improved capture of daily N2O fluxes and uptakes on Kenyan soils.

AB Adoption of crop residue amendments has been increasingly recommended as an effective management practice for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing soil fertility, thereby increasing crop production. However, the effect of biochar and straw on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions in soils of differing pH remains poorly understood. Three treatments (control (i.e., no amendment), maize straw, and biochar derived from maize straw) were therefore established separately in soils with different pH levels, classified as follows: acidic, neutral, and alkaline. N2O and CH4 were investigated using a static chamber-gas chromatography system during 57 days of a mesocosm study. The results showed that cumulative N2O emissions were significantly higher in acidic soils than in other experimental soils, with the values ranging from 7.48 to 11.3 kg N ha(-1), while CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.060 to 0.089 kg C ha(-1), with inconclusive results. However, a weak negative correlation was observed between log N2O and log NO3-N in acidic soil with either biochar or straw, while the same parameters with CH4 showed a moderate negative correlation, suggesting a likelihood that these amendments could mitigate GHGs as a result of the NO3-N increase in acidic soils. It is also possible, given the alkaline nature of the biochar, that incorporation had a significant buffer effect on soil acidity, effectively increasing soil pH by >0.5 pH units. Our findings suggest that for the rates of application for biochar and straw used in this study, the magnitude of reductions in the emissions of N2O and CH4 are dependent in part on initial soil pH.

AB Direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from fertilized soils are generally estimated using emission factors. However, the emission factors for N2O emission of applied slurry are not well quantified. The effect of slurry application technique on N2O emission was quantified in field experiments in the Netherlands in order to derive N2O emission factors for (shallow) injected and surface-applied cattle and pig slurries. Fluxes of N2O were measured using a closed flux chamber technique and a photo-acoustic infra-red gasmonitor. Fluxes of N2O were measured 64-83 times on grassland on sandy and clay soils and maize land on sandy soil, in the period 2007-2009. There were large differences in total N2O emission between the years, and differences between treatments were not consistent over the years and sites. The average emission factor of all treatments and years (n = 35) was 0.9% of the N applied, which is close to the default IPCC emission factor of 1%. However, the range in emission was large, i.e. from -0.2% to 7.0%. The average emission factor for grassland was 1.7% of the N applied for calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN), 0.4% for shallow injected cattle slurry, and 0.1% for surface-applied cattle slurry. For maize land, the average emission factor for CAN was 0.1% of the N applied, for injected cattle slurry 0.9% and for surface-applied cattle slurry 0.4%. The emission factors for pig slurry applied to maize land were higher than for cattle slurry; 3.6% for injected pig slurry and 0.9% for surface-applied pig slurry. Increasing the N application rate on maize land resulted in higher emission factors for CAN, injected cattle slurry, and injected pig slurry. Concluding, on both grassland and maize land (shallow) injection of slurry increased the average emission factor of N2O in comparison to surface application. Differentiation of N2O emission factors which takes specific factors into account, such as N type and rate and application technique, can improve the quantification of N2O emission from agricultural soils and is needed to derive most efficient options for mitigation.

AB Dynamic biogeochemical models are crucial tools for simulating the complex interaction between soils, climate and plants; thus the need for improving understanding of nutrient cycling and reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the environment. This study aimed to calibrate and validate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model for soil moisture, temperature, respiration, nitrous oxide and maize crop growth simulation in drier sub-humid parts of the central highlands of Kenya. We measured soil GHG fluxes from a maize field under four different soil fertility management practices for one year using static chambers and gas chromatography. Using experimental data collected from four management practices during GHG sampling period, we parameterized the DNDC model. The results indicate that the DNDC model simulates daily and annual soil moisture, soil temperature, soil respiration (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), N2O yield-scaled emissions (YSE), N2O emission factors (EFs) and maize crop growth with a high degree of fitness. However, the DNDC simulations slightly underestimated soil temperature (2-6%), crop growth (2-45%) and N2O emissions (5-23%). The simulation over-estimated soil moisture (9-17%) and CO2 emissions (3-10%). It however, perfectly simulated YSE and EFs. Compared to the observed/measured annual GHG trends, the simulation results were relatively good, with an almost perfect fitting of emission peaks during soil rewetting at the onset of rains, coinciding with soil fertilisation. These findings provide reliable information in selecting best farm management practice, which simultaneously improves agricultural productivity and reduces GHG emissions, thus permitting climate-smart agriculture. The good DNDC simulated YSE and EFs values (Tier III) provide cheaper and reliable ways of filling the huge GHG data gap, reducing uncertainties in national GHG inventories and result to efficient targeting of mitigation measures in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Traditional irrigated double-rice cropping systems have to cope with reduced water availability due to changes of climate and economic conditions. To quantify the shift in CH4 and N2O emissions when changing from traditional to diversified double cropping-systems, an experiment including flooded rice, non-flooded "aerobic" rice and maize was conducted during the dry season (February-June 2012) in the Philippines. Two automated static chamber-GC systems were used to continuously measure CH4 and N2O emissions in the three cropping systems of which each included three different nitrogen fertilization regimes. Turning away from flooded cropping systems leads to shifts in greenhouse gas emissions from CH4 under wet soil to N2O emissions under drier soil conditions. The global warming potential (GWP) of the non-flooded crops was lower compared to flooded rice, whereas high CH4 emissions under flooded conditions still override enhanced N2O emissions in the upland systems. The yield-scaled GWP favored maize over aerobic rice, due to lower yields of aerobic rice. However, the lower GHG emissions of upland systems are only beneficial if they are not overwhelmed by enhanced losses of soil organic carbon.

AB Intercrop systems can exhibit unique soil properties compared to monocultures, which influences the microbially-mediated processes leading to greenhouse gas emissions. Fertilized intercrops and monocultures produce different amounts of N2O, CO2 and CH4 depending on their nutrient and water use efficiencies. The objective of this study was to compare the fluxes and seasonal emissions of N2O, CO2, and CH4 from a maize-soybean intercrop compared to maize and soybean monocultures, in relation to crop effects on soil properties. The experiment was conducted during 2012, 2013 and 2014 at the WuQiao Experimental Station in the North China Plain. All cropping systems received urea-N fertilizer (240 kg N ha(-1) applied in two split applications). The cropping systems were a net source of CO2 and a net sink of CH4, with significantly (P < 0.05 in 2012) and numerically (2013 and 2014) lower N2O flux and smaller seasonal N2O emissions from the maize-soybean intercrop than the maize monoculture. The proportion of urea-N lost as N2O was lower in the maize-soybean intercrop (1.6% during the 3-year study) and soybean monoculture (1.7%), compared to maize monoculture (2.3%). Soybean reduced the soil NO3 (-)-N concentration and created a cooler, drier environment that was less favorable for denitrification, although we cannot rule out the possibility of N2O reduction to N-2 and other N compounds by soybean and its associated N-2-fixing prokaryotes. We conclude that maize-soybean intercrop has potential to reduce N2O emissions in fertilized agroecosystems and should be considered in developing climate-smart cropping systems in the North China Plain.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils represent a major environmental concern and require sustainable nitrogen (N) management strategies. The timing of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) termination was investigated to improve N synchronization and to assess its potential to replace fallow as an alternative N source for maize (Zea mays L.) without increasing N2O emissions compared to urea, while maintaining productivity. An experiment was conducted over two seasons to assess N2O emissions (43 measurements per season) and soil N dynamics in fallow/maize and vetch/maize sequences with two termination timings. Cumulative N2O emissions in vetch/maize sequence ranged from 0.59 to 1.77 kg N2O-N ha(-1) , while in fallow/maize ranged from 0.55 to 1.18 kg N2O-N ha(-1) . Nitrogen fertilization increased emissions by 4.5-17.6 %, while the use of vetch before maize increased them by 9.6-48.5 % compared to fallow/maize sequence. Reducing the interval between vetch termination and maize sowing from similar to 31 days (early termination) to similar to 10 days (late termination) improved N synchronization by 13 %. Late vetch termination and N-fertilized fallow showed similar N2O emissions, with improved synchronization reducing emissions by 13-21 % compared to early termination. Regression trees identified soil temperature, ammonium, and water-filled pore space (WFPS) as key drivers of N2O emissions during the fallow or vetch period, whereas nitrate and WFPS became the dominant factors during the maize season. Furthermore, the first emission factors for hairy vetch (< 0.17 %) were reported, which were significantly lower than the IPCC default (1 %). These findings offer critical insights into refining greenhouse gas inventories and optimizing vetch management to reduce emissions while maintaining or enhancing maize productivity.

AB To examine the reduction of ammonia (NH3) volatilisation, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and production of grain yield in maize from urea fertiliser with the addition of chemical and natural urease inhibitors, a field experiment was conducted for one growing season of maize on sandy soil at Jabatan Pertanian Perak, Malaysia. Four replicates of three treatments: Urea (control), urea coated with thiosulfinate (UThiol) and urea coated with triamida N-(n-butil) tiofosforica, known as NBPT (UNBPT). After fertiliser application, NH3 volatilisation, N2O emission and grain yield were monitored at different timing. The NH3 volatilisation was determined using the Draeger tube method while N2O emission was discovered using the closed chamber technique. UNBPT showed the lowest NH3 volatilisation as compared with urea, followed by UThiol. For N2O emission, there is no significant difference between UNBPT and UThiol but both treatments recorded significant difference with Urea (control). The maize production exhibited a positive significant result by increasing the maize yield in UNBPT and UThiol than Urea (control) treatment. These results suggest that using natural inhibitor may have the most potential to reduce N losses and improve yield nearly as efficiently as chemical inhibitor.

AB There is a growing concern that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during agricultural energy crop production might negate GHG emission savings which was not intended when promoting the use of renewable energy. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a major GHG, and in addition, it is the most powerful ozone-depleting compound that is emitted by human activity. The use of N fertilizers and animal manures is the main anthropogenic source of N2O emissions. In spite of their high relevance, we still have limited understanding of the complex underlying microbial processes that consume or produce N2O and their interactions with soil types, fertilizers (rate and types), plants, and other environmental variables. In a 2-year field experiment, we compared two important biogas crops in two different agro-ecological regions of northern Germany for their productivity and GHG emissions, using the closed-chamber technique and high time-resolution sampling. Silage maize, which is currently the most widespread crop grown for biogas fermentation purposes in Germany, was compared with an alternative bioenergy crop at each site. The three forms of nitrogen fertilizers/manures were given: calcium ammonium nitrate, cattle/pig slurry, and biogas residue. The greatest N2O flux activity occurred in the period of May-July in all crops and at both sites. Flux patterns indicated pronounced effects of soil moisture-soil mineral-N interactions which were also seen as causation of the higher N2O fluxes in the bioenergy crop maize compared to the other tested energy crops. However, the N2O emission per unit methane production (specific N2O emission) was clearly lower in soils planted with maize due to significantly higher methane hectare yield of maize. Our data suggest a linear relationship between increasing N input and increases in N2O emission in both years at site with sandy loam texture where highest N2O fluxes were measured. At sandy loam site, the percentage of applied N being emitted as N2O was 1.9 and 1.1 % in soils cropped with maize and 0.9 and 0.8 % in soils cropped with wheat during the investigation period 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, respectively. In contrast, at site with sandy soil texture, the percentage of applied N emitted as N2O was only 0.6 and 0.7 % in maize soils and 0.4 and 0.3 % in grassland during 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 period, respectively. Higher daily and annual N2O emissions at the sandy loam site were attributed to the finer soil texture and higher denitrification activity. The present study provides a very good basis for the assessment of direct emissions of greenhouse gases from relevant biogas crops in North-West Europe.

AB Plastic film and gravel mulching have long been used to improve crop production, but few studies have focused on the effects of these mulching practices on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Understanding the response of N2O emission to soil surface mulching is beneficial for improving management practices. We performed two field experiments over two years in northwestern China to measure the annual N2O emissions using the static chamber technique: first, we compared the N2O emissions from non-mulched (BP), gravel-mulched (GM) and plastic film-mulched (FM) maize (Zea mays L.) fields that received an equivalent nitrogen (N) application rate; second, we monitored the N2O emissions from film-mulched maize fields that received different N application rates [N applied at 0 (NO), 250 (N250) and 380 (N380) kg N ha(-1)]. Compared to the BP treatment, both the GM and FM treatments markedly improved the soil temperature and moisture, Which significantly increased the maize yields and N uptake but did not increase the N(2)Oemissions, most likely because the decreased soil mineral N content limited the N2O production. As a result, the yield-scaled N2O emissions were markedly reduced in the GM and FM treatments, and a greater reduction was observed in the FM treatment due to the higher grain yield. The N(2)Oemissions persistently increased with an increasing N rate, but the grain yield peaked in the N250 treatment in which the N input was nearly equivalent to the maize N uptake. Consequently, low yield-scaled N2O emissions were obtained in the N250 treatment (125 and 155 g N2O-N Mg-1 grain in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, respectively). Thus, we conclude that film mulching combined with an appropriate N input is a preferable management practice to improve the grain yield and to simultaneously minimize the direct N2O emission intensity in agriculture.

AB Intensive dairy farming systems are a large source of emission of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), because of high nitrogen (N) application rates to grasslands and silage maize fields. The objective of this study was to compare measured N2O emissions from two different soils to default N2O emission factors, and to look at alternative emission factors based on (i) the N uptake in the crop and (ii) the N surplus of the system, i.e., N applied minus N uptake by the crop. Twelve N fertilization regimes were implemented on a sandy soil (typic endoaquoll) and a clay soil (typic endoaquept) in the Netherlands, and N2O emissions were measured throughout the growing season. Highest cumulative fluxes of 1.92 and 6.81 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the sandy soil and clay soil were measured at the highest slurry application rate of 250 kg N ha(-1). Background emissions from unfertilized soils were 0.14 and 1.52 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the sandy soil and the clay soil, respectively. Emission factors for the sandy soil averaged 0.08, 0.51 and 0.26% of the N applied via fertilizer, slurry, and combinations of both. For the clay soil, these numbers were 1.18, 1.21 and 1.69%, respectively. Surplus N was linearly related to N2O emission for both the sandy soil (R-2 = 0.60) and the clay soil (R-2 = 0.40), indicating a possible alternative emission factor. We concluded that, in our study, N2O emission was not linearly related to N application rates, and varied with type and application rate of fertilizer. Finally, the relatively high emission from the clay soil indicates that background emissions might have to be taken into account in N2O budgets.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most important non-CO2 greenhouse gas and soil management systems should be evaluated for their N2O mitigation potential. This research evaluated a long-term (22 years) experiment testing the effect of soil management systems on N2O emissions in the postharvest period (autumn) from a subtropical Rhodic Hapludox at the research center FUNDACEP, in Cruz Alta, state of Rio Grande do Sul. Three treatments were evaluated, one under conventional tillage with soybean residues (CTsoybean) and two under no-tillage with soybean (NTsoybean) and maize residues (NTmaize). N2O emissions were measured eight times within 24 days (May 2007) using closed static chambers. Gas flows were obtained based on the relations between gas concentrations in the chamber at regular intervals (0, 15, 30,45 min) analyzed by gas chromatography. After soybean harvest, accumulated N2O emissions in the period were approximately three times higher in the untilled soil (164 mg m(-2) N) than under CT (51 mg m(-2) N), with a short-lived N2O peak of 670 mg m(-2) h(-1) N. In contrast, soil N2O emissions in NT were lower after maize than after soybean, with a N2O peak of 127 g m(-2) h(-1) N. The multivariate analysis of N2O fluxes and soil variables, which were determined simultaneously with air sampling, demonstrated that the main driving variables of soil N2O emissions were soil microbial activity, temperature, water-filled pore space, and NO3- content. To replace soybean monoculture, crop rotation including maize must be considered as a strategy to decrease soil N2O emissions from NT soils in Southern Brazil in a Autumn.

AB The incorporation of animal manure (AM) in soil plays an essential role in soil carbon sequestration but might induce higher soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The use of nitrification inhibitors (NI) is an effective strategy to abate N2O emission in agro-ecosystems. However, very few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of applying NI under the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers for increasing soil carbon sequestration and reducing N2O emissions simultaneously in Northeast China. Here, a four-year field experiment was conducted with three treatments [inorganic fertilizer (NPK), inorganic fertilizer + manure (NPKM), and inorganic fertilizer with NI + manure (NPKI + M)], in a rainfed maize cropping system in Northeast China. Plots of different treatments were kept in the same locations for 4 years. Gas samples were collected using the static closed chamber technique, and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentration in gas samples was quantified using a gas chromatograph. Soil organic carbon sequestration rate (SOCSR) was calculated based on the changes in SOC from April 2012 to October 2015. Averaged over the four years, AM incorporation significantly increased soil N2O emissions by 25.8% (p < 0.05), compared to NPK treatment. DMPP (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate) significantly decreased N2O emissions by 32.5% (p < 0.05) relative to NPKM treatment. SOC content was significantly elevated by 24.1% in the NPKI + M treatment than the NPK treatment after four years of manure application (p < 0.05). The annual topsoil SOCSR for the NPKM and NPKI + M treatments was 0.57 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 1.02 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, which were significantly higher than that of NPK treatment (- 0.61 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), p < 0.05). AM addition significantly increased the aboveground biomass and crop yields of maize in the fourth year. Overall, combined application of DMPP, inorganic fertilizer and AM is strongly recommended in this rainfed maize cropping system, which can increase maize yield and SOC sequestration rate, and mitigate N2O emission.

AB Nitrogen (N) fertilizer use is rapidly intensifying on tropical croplands and has the potential to increase emissions of the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O). Since about 2005 Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil has shifted from single-cropped soybeans to double-cropping soybeans with maize, and now produces 1.5% of the world's maize. This production shift required an increase in N fertilization, but the effects on N2O emissions are poorly known. We calibrated the process-oriented biogeochemical DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model to simulate N2O emissions and crop production from soybean and soybean-maize cropping systems in MT. After model validation with field measurements and adjustments for hydrological properties of tropical soils, regional simulations suggested N2O emissions from soybean-maize cropland increased almost fourfold during 2001-2010, from 1.1 +/- 1.1 to 4.1 +/- 3.2 Gg 1014 N-N2O. Model sensitivity tests showed that emissions were spatially and seasonably variable and especially sensitive to soil bulk density and carbon content. Meeting future demand for maize using current soybean area in MT might require either (a) intensifying 3.0 million ha of existing single soybean to soybean-maize or (b) increasing N fertilization to ~180 kg N ha(-1) on existing 2.3 million ha of soybean-maize area. The latter strategy would release ~35% more N2O than the first. Our modifications of the DNDC model will improve estimates of N2O emissions from agricultural production in MT and other tropical areas, but narrowing model uncertainty will depend on more detailed field measurements and spatial data on soil and cropping management.

AB Soil emissions of nitrous oxide contribute substantially to global warming from agriculture. Spatiotemporal variation in nitrous oxide emissions within agricultural fields leads to uncertainty in the benefits of climate-smart agricultural practices. Here, we present a conceptual model explaining spatial variation in temporal patterns of soil nitrous oxide emissions developed from high spatial resolution measurements of soil nitrous oxide emissions, gross nitrous oxide fluxes, and soil physicochemical properties in two maize fields in Illinois, USA. In sub-field locations with consistently low nitrous oxide emissions, soil nitrate and dissolved organic carbon constrained nitrous oxide production irrespective of changes in soil moisture. In sub-field locations where high emissions occurred episodically, soil nitrate and dissolved organic carbon availability were higher, and increases in soil moisture stimulated nitrous oxide production. These findings form the 'cannon model' which conceptualizes how sub-field scale variation in soil nitrate and dissolved organic carbon determines where increases in soil moisture can trigger high soil nitrous oxide emissions within agricultural fields.
   Only in areas of agricultural fields where nitrate and dissolved organic carbon availability were high could soil moisture stimulate high nitrous oxide emissions, according to a conceptual model based on spatial measurements of emissions and soil properties.

AB High spatiotemporal variability in soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes challenges quantification and prediction of emissions to evaluate the climate change mitigation outcomes of sustainable agricultural practices. Triggers for large, short-lived N2O emission pulses, such as rainfall and fertilization, alter soil oxygen (O-2) and nitrate (NO3-) availability to favor N2O production via denitrification. However, the organic C (OC) needed to fuel denitrification may exhibit subfield variation that constrains the potential for high denitrification rates to occur, leading to spatial variation in N2O hot moments. We tested the hypothesis that the particulate organic matter (POM) fraction of soil organic matter (SOM) controls subfield variation in denitrification potential by regulating availability of dissolved organic C (DOC), the form of OC used by denitrifiers. Among 38 soil samples collected across a maize field in central Illinois, USA, we found that potential denitrification rate was best predicted by POM C concentration (R-2 = 0.35). Using multiple linear regression analysis that included other soil properties as explanatory variables, we found that POM C fraction of bulk soil (mg POM C/g SOC) was the most important predictor based on regression coefficient size (P < 0.01). Our results, which provide support for our hypothesis, suggest that consideration of the link between C and N cycling may be a key to predicting spatiotemporal variation in soil N2O emissions when denitrification is the dominant N2O source process.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas primarily released by fertilizers used in crop cultivation. In Thailand, cropland occupies the majority of the arable land but studies on N2O emissions from cropland remain scarce. The present study aimed to evaluate the N2O emissions, soil characteristics, and crop productivity resulting from different long-term fertilizer applications in a crop rotation of maize and mung bean. A long-term experimental field managed through crop residue incorporation combined with different fertilizer applications over 45 years was utilized in this study. It consisted of four distinct treatments: no fertilizer (CON), 134 kg N ha(-1) from organic fertilizer (ORG), 188 kg N ha(-1) from chemical fertilizer (CHE), and 322 kg N ha(-1) from a combination of organic and chemical fertilizers (OAC). Long-term application of chemical fertilizer induced soil acidification, whereas the use of organic fertilizer maintained soil pH and enhanced soil carbon accumulation. Results showed that the OAC, CHE, and ORG practices significantly (p < 0.05) increased direct N2O emissions from the soil, particularly during the maize cultivation period. Annual cumulative N2O emissions were enhanced on average by 204 % (3.22 kg N2O ha(-1)) in OAC, (1)81 % (2.98 kg N2O ha(-1)) in CHE, and 79.4 % (1.90 kg N2O ha(-1)) in ORG compared with CON (1.06 kg N2O ha(-1)), indicating that larger N input rates induced larger N2O emissions. Chemical fertilizer induced significantly (p < 0.05) larger and faster N2O emissions than organic fertilizer. When considering N2O emissions per N application rate in all treatments as the emission factor, the use of N fertilizers combined with crop residues in the soil over two years averaged 0.61 % (+/- 0.13 %). This value was approximately 39 % lower than the default value recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is currently used in Thailand. The consecutive addition of fertilizers significantly (p < 0.05) increased maize grain yield compared with the CON. However, no significant differences were observed among the various fertilizer treatments. Despite all fertilizer applications induced larger N2O emissions, they also produced greater crop yields. Consequently, this study recommended the practice of ORG as a means to mitigate emissions without compromising crop yield and soil quality.

AB The objectives of this 2-year field study were to assess the effects of irrigation and nitrogen (N) application on nitrous oxide (N2O). Soil N2O flux was determined using open-bottomed chambers. Nitrous oxide concentrations were determined with gas chromatography. The results showed that in 2008, N2O emission rates ranged from 2.0 to 50.0 g N ha(-1) d(-1) in the alternating furrow irrigation and N application treatments (AFINA) and from 2.4 to 68.4 g N ha(-1) d(-1) in the conventional every-furrow irrigation and fertilization treatment (CIF). In 2009, cumulative N2O-N loss in the optimal combination with greater yields and lower N2O emission in AFINA was 1277 g N ha(-1) compared to 1695 g N ha(-1) with CIF. The study indicated that AFINA practices combined with optimum N fertilizer and irrigation rates could reduce soil N2O emission and water input compared to CIF practices without causing a decline in corn yield.

AB An accurate estimation of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from 110 million ha of upland in China is essential for the adoption of effective mitigation strategies. In this study, the effects of different tillage practices combined with nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications on N2O emission in soils were considered for a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - summer maize (Zea mays L.) double cropping system. Treatments included conventional tillage plus urea in split application (CTF1), conventional tillage with urea in a single application (CTF2), no-tillage with straw retained plus reduced urea in a split application (NTSF1) and no-tillage with manure plus reduced urea in a split application (NTMF1). The amounts of N input in each treatment were 285 and 225kg N/ha for wheat and maize, respectively. Both NTSF1 and NTMF1 were found to reduce chemical N fertilizer rates by 33.3% (wheat) and 20% (maize), respectively, compared to CTF1 and CTF2. N2O emissions varied between 3.2 (NTSF1) and 9.9 (CTF2) kg N2O-N/ha during the wheat season and between 7.6 (NTFS1) and 14.0 (NTMF1) kg N2O-N/ha during the maize season. The yield-based emission factors ranged from 21.9 (NTSF1) to 60.9 (CTF2) g N2O-N/kgN for wheat and 92.5 (NTSF1) to 157.4 (NTMF1) g N2O-N/kgN for maize. No significant effect of the treatments on crop yield was found. In addition to reducing production costs involved in land preparation, NTSF1 was shown to decrease chemical fertilizer input and mitigate N2O emissions while sustaining crop yield.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from denitrification in agricultural soils often increases with N fertilizer and soil nitrate (NO3) concentrations. Overwintering cover crops in cereal rotations can decrease soil NO3 concentrations and may decrease N2O emissions. However, mineralizable C availability can be a more important control on N2O emission than NO3 concentration in fertilized soils, and cover crop residue provides mineralizable C input. We measured the effect of a winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop on soil N2O emissions from a maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system treated with banded N fertilizer at three rates (0, 135, and 225 kg N ha(-1)) in Iowa. In addition, we conducted laboratory incubations to determine if potential N2O emissions were limited by mineralizable C or NO3 at these N rates. The rye cover crop decreased soil NO3 concentrations at all N rates. Although the cover crop decreased N2O emissions when no N fertilizer was applied, it increased N2O emissions at an N rate near the economic optimum. In laboratory incubations, N2O emissions from soils from fertilizer bands did not increase with added NO3, but did increase with added glucose. These results show that mineralizable C availability can control N2O emissions, indicating that C from cover crop residue increased N2O emissions from fertilizer band soils in the field. Mineralizable C availability should be considered in future evaluations of cover crop effects on N2O emissions, especially as cover crops are evaluated as a strategy to mitigate agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

AB The effect of dairy manure amendments to agricultural soil on the yield-scaled nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remains unclear. We hypothesize that an optimum ratio of dairy manure to synthetic fertilizers leads to large nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and small yield-scaled N2O emissions. The aims of this study were to (1) quantify the variations in the crop yields and N2O emissions from winter wheat-summer maize cropping systems in Northwest China, (2) determine the responses of the NUE and yield-scaled N2O emission to the ratio of organic materials to synthetic fertilizers, and (3) evaluate the relationship between the NUE and yield-scaled N2O emissions. Field measurements were conducted within long- and short-term fertilization experiments between the years of 2014 and 2016. Treatments included synthetic fertilizers, synthetic fertilizers plus crop residues, and synthetic fertilizers plus dairy manure at both sites. The annual grain yields and N2O emissions varied from 13.3 to 18.0 Mg ha(-1) and from 1.3 to 3.6 kg N ha(-1), respectively, across the treatments. The yield-scaled N2O emissions related negatively to the NUE, suggesting that agronomic aims of improving NUE are an effective approach to mitigate N2O emissions. The ratio of organic materials to synthetic fertilizers was not a significant limit on the NUE and yield-scaled N2O emissions. We conclude that organic amendments appeared to play a minor influence on the promotion of the NUE and N2O mitigation.

AB The study concerned the determination of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under conventional and reduced tillage conditions. In the reduced cultivation, a soil cultivating seed drill was used for simultaneous sowing of seeds and subsurface application of fertilizer. The emission levels of the gas tested were dependent on the year of the study and the method of soil tillage, and were subject to considerable changes during the growing season. The use of reduced soil tillage significantly limited emissions of the analysed gas into the atmosphere. Depending on the year of the study, N2O emission in the reduced tillage system was from 15% to 40% lower than in the conventional system. Low levels of easily mineralized components in soil could have been the cause of the reduction in N2O emissions to the atmosphere.

AB Despite the ever-increasing measurements of denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions globally, boundary line analyses of these important processes have only been applied to a limited number of agroecosystems. The primary aims of this study were to determine the responses of denitrification and N2O emissions from a subtropical cropland to several soil parameters through boundary line analyses, and to evaluate the ability of site-specific boundary line models for simulating gaseous nitrogen (N) losses using available soil parameters. We performed 403 measurements of denitrification and N2O emissions from two fields cropped with a winter wheat-summer maize rotation in the Sichuan Basin, Southwest China, from October 2004 to September 2005. Boundary lines were fitted for denitrification and N2O emission data against soil temperature, water content, ammonium and/or nitrate substrates, and heterotrophic respiration rates. The boundary lines were largely in agreement with existing theoretical concepts. By incorporating the regulatory effects of soil temperature, water content, N substrates, and an unknown factor that could be related to ammoniumcontent, the boundary linemodels reasonably simulated the seasonal variations in denitrification and N2O emissions thatwere collected froma field trial in the same region during the maize season in 2012. The models overestimated the denitrification and N2O emissions on the sampling dates by 8% and 22% on average, respectively. We conclude that boundary linemodels are useful tools for estimating gaseous N losses from a given cropland. However, the application of the models is limited by the availability of input data.

AB Optimizing nitrogen fertilizers use can improve maize yields, soil fertility, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions, but it remains uncertain as to what impact it will continue to have in the context of ongoing climatic changes. In this research, we use long-term field experimental data and the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model to evaluate the impact of combining manure with chemical fertilizers on spring maize yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Using four future climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) based on Global Climate Models (GCMs), the APSIM model showed climate change will reduce the maize yield and SOC content compared to the preceding decade. Increasing manure use could mitigate the decrease in maize yield and SOC content under future climate scenarios in contrast to current practices, however, this would in all climate scenarios promote nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Evaluating crop productivity, soil health, environmental impact, and economic considerations, this study recommends replacing 50 % of the nitrogen in farmers' conventional chemical fertilization practices with manure (RFP0.5) as the optimal approach. This approach is a perfect balance which effectively mitigates maize yields and SOC loss in response to future climate change, while also addressing greenhouse gas emissions.

AB N stabilizers such as urease and nitrification inhibitors are potential tools for mitigating N2O emissions and improving maize yield. However, the efficacy of N stabilizers is inconsistent across a broad range of agro-ecosystems. To enable the large-scale use of N stabilizers for sustainable agricultural development, it is necessary to identify the benefits of N stabilizers and the driving factors that regulate their efficiency. Here, we evaluated the efficiencies of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) and N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) in four typical ecological sites with contrasting climatic and soil conditions in the maize production area of China (Gongzhuling, Wuqiao, Xinxiang, and Wenzhou). Disparate ecological sites significantly influenced the N2O emissions (0.2-19.0 kg N2O-N ha -1) and maize yields (7.5-13.9 Mt ha -1). Also, N stabilizers reduced N2O emissions by 1.3-93.9 % across the four sites. Compared to NBPT, DMPP showed higher efficiency, but the joint inhibitor (NBPT+DMPP) had non-significant effects compared to DMPP. Although N stabilizers did not signifi-cantly increase maize yield, they reduced yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSNEs) by 3.1-83.4 % (p < 0.05) across study sites. Hotspots of N2O emission occurred within two weeks after N fertilization, and the mitigation of N stabilizers on N2O emissions was strongly reduced over time. This implies the degradation velocity of N stabi-lizers was critical for emissions mitigation efficiency. Meanwhile, environmental factors obviously influenced N stabilizers efficiency. Random forest and correlation analyses indicated that soil pH and sand content showed positive correlations and high importance for the N2O mitigation efficiencies of N stabilizers, whereas water -filled pore space and salt content showed negative correlations and high importance. In addition, N2O mitiga-tion efficiencies of different N stabilizers showed a different response to environmental changes, wherein higher environmental sensitivity and easy invalidation under unsuitable conditions were observed in NBPT than in DMPP. In conclusion, DMPP effectively mitigated YSNEs in all study sites, and its efficiency was closely regulated by soil pH, water-filled pore space, and soil texture. Therefore, amending soil quality may enhance the benefits of DMPP and might decrease future N2O emissions in the maize fields of China.

AB Residue return in combination with synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer is increasingly being considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield. In most studies, however, attention has mainly been paid to the way that significant changes in the soil N mineralization process affect the soil N cycle, while the effect of different residue return amounts on ammonia (NH3) volatilization and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, potentially the most important components of N losses and environmental effects has, to a certain extent, been neglected, notably in north-eastern China. Therefore, a trial was set up in an Alfisol/arable soil during 2015-2016 to monitor annual NH3 volatilization and N2O emission dynamics from a fertilized maize field with residue return at different rates. Treatments included N fertilizer alone and N fertilizer in combination with either half or the full yield of the maize residue (5.8 x 10(3) or 11.6 x 10(3) kg ha(-1), respectively) returned to the soil surface after harvest.
   Over a growing season of maize, the NH3 volatilization loss rate from the full residue return treatment was 4.6%, which was significantly lower than that in the N fertilizer application only and half residue return plots (6.1%). Meanwhile, residue return rates showed a significant effect on annual N2O emissions from the maize system. Half residue return increased N2O emission (921.1 g N.ha(-1)), while full residue return marginally decreased N2O emissions (862.6 g N.ha(-1)) during the maize growing season, compared to the fertilizer-only treatment (881.2 g N.ha(-1)) (P < 0.05). In spite of the fact that N2O emissions in the non-growing season increased with the quantity of maize residue applied, the return of the full yield of maize residue to the soil could reduce both annual NH3 and annual N2O losses and increase soil total N and C storage after long-term use. It is suggested that residue application rate is a key factor when assessing residue benefits but the influence is in a nonlinear pattern. The combined application of full maize residue and synthetic N fertilizer is a promising N management strategy for mitigating gaseous N emissions.

AB Previous studies simply focused on determining nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the soil under different tillage operations and nitrogen (N) fertilizations without considering crop yield. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of different tillage operations and N fertilizations on N2O emissions and crop yield from upland soil. Two different tillage operations [conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT)] and N fertilizations [without urea (WOU) and with 186 kg N ha(-1) of urea (WU)] were established in a randomized block design with three replications on upland soil. Maize (Zea mays) was cultivated from 6th July to 4th October, 2018 (year 1), and from 15th April to 26th July, 2019 (year 2). The daily N2O flux did not peak soon after tillage operation and N fertilization, but it was more related to the change in water-filled pore space (WFPS). The mean value of WFPS across N fertilizations and seasons (years) was higher in CT than in NT. The changes of nitrification and denitrification rates could be attributed to the differences in WFPS between CT and NT. Nitrification was the predominant process producing N2O with CT, but denitrification was with NT. The application of urea increased cumulative N2O emissions, while CT also increased it compared with NT. The order of the mean values of cumulative N2O emissions across seasons from the highest to the lowest was as follows: CT + WU (7.12 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1)) > NT + WU (5.69 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1)) >= CT + WOU (5.02 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1)) > NT + WOU (4.24 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1)). Tillage operation did not affect the grain yield of maize or yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSNE). However, the application of urea increased the grain yield of maize and decreased YSNE, implying it could reduce N2O emission per unit of maize grain production. No-tillage management did not decrease YSNE value compared to CT operation, but N fertilization significantly decreased YSNE in the current study.

AB While tropical grasses were shown to inhibit the activity of soil nitrifiers, their role in greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia (NH3) emissions in N fertilized maize-based rotations are poorly understood. A 3-year (2014-2017) field experiment was conducted in southeastern Brazil to assess the influence of forage grass and N fertilization on nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and NH3 emissions from maize (Zea mays L.)-grass rotations. Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv. Tanzania), palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu), and ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis cv. Comum) were grown in the main plots, while an unfertilized control and 140 kg N ha(-1) were applied annually to maize in sub-plots. No apparent nitrification suppression by the grasses was detected. N2O fluxes increased following N fertilizer addition in maize, particularly in the second season, where slightly higher cumulative N2O emission was observed with N fertilization in comparison with the control. CH4 fluxes showed high variation in the first forage and maize growing seasons. Residual N fertilizer decreased soil CH4 uptake of palisade grass and ruzigrass compared with unfertilized palisade grass in the second forage season. Cumulative NH3 emissions were unaffected by forage species and N fertilization. However, in both maize seasons, yield-scaled NH3 emission was the lowest following N addition. Throughout the seasons, the differences between the three grasses in N2O, CH4, and NH3 emissions were minimal. We conclude that the tropical perennial grasses rotated with maize were similar regarding GHG and NH3 emissions, while N fertilization slightly increased N2O emission and decreased soil CH4 uptake.

AB Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured in agricultural lands used for farming wheat and maize during 1998 in the states of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala in Mexico. In an irrigated wheat field (El Tenhe, Hidalgo), an average flux of -10.85 mug N2O-N m(-2)h(-1) was obtained for the total cycle (155 days between December and May). There, high negative values were observed with Water Fill Porous Space (WFPS) close to 70%. The average flux of the complete cycle (269 days between March and December) in an irrigated maize field (El Progreso, Hidalgo) was 37.43 mug N2O-N m(-2)h(-1). In this case, more significant negative fluxes were found with WFPS close to 45% or less. These last results may have been influenced by the strong "El Nino", which occurred in the middle of 1998. Twenty one percent of the measurements in the state of Hidalgo showed soil acting as a nitrous oxide sink. The samples from Tlaxcala showed that these fields acted as emitters. In the rain fed fields in the state of Tlaxcala, an average flux of 121 mug N2O-Nm(-2)h(-1) was obtained for the wheat field. The farming season lasted 142 days, from July to December. In addition, for the maize field the averaged flux was 285.61 mug N2O-Nm(-2)h(-1). The fanning season lasted 246 days, from April to December.

AB This research investigated the N2O fluxes and community compositions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system on the North China Plain. The experiment included three treatments: 1) a control treatment (CK); 2) biochar at 10.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (C); and 3) organic fertilizer at 7.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (M). The application of biochar reduced the cumulative N2O emissions by 47.7% and 62.2% in the maize and wheat seasons, respectively, compared with those of the CK treatment. Organic fertilizer increased the cumulative N2O emissions by 311.1% in the maize season and had no significant effects on them in the wheat season. Organic fertilizer reduced the cumulative N2O emissions by 39.8% in the nonfertilizer period of the maize season. The cumulative N2O emissions in the maize season accounted for 75.2-90.0% of the annual emissions among all the treatments. Biochar and organic fertilizer affected soil N2O emissions mainly by changing soil denitrifiers. In the maize season, the lower abundances of Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum (AOA-amoA), Nitrosomonas (AOB-amoA), Mesorhizobium (nirK), Magnetospirillum (nirS) and Halomonas (nirS) may result in lower N2O emissions in the biochar treatment, and organic fertilizer had a similar influencing mechanism on N2O emissions during the nonbasic fertilizer and nontopdressing periods of the maize season. In the wheat season, the dominant genus Alicycliphilus (nosZ) was the major contributor to decreasing N2O emissions in the biochar treatment, while there was no biomarker related to N2O emissions in the M treatment. The soil pH, NO3--N content and water-filled pore space (WFPS) were the key factors shifting the community compositions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in this study. The application of biochar could be a better practice to improve saline-alkali soil with lower N2O emissions. These findings will improve our understanding of the nitrifiers and denitrifiers response to biochar and organic fertilizer.

AB Conventional nitrogen fertilization in a maize cropping system enhances the soil's methane (CH4) sink but exacerbates emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). This study demonstrates that conventional nitrogen application (UN) increased CH4 uptake by 154%, while elevating N2O and NO emissions by 190% and 301%, respectively, compared to zero nitrogen plots (N0). Fertilization fundamentally reconfigured the regulatory mechanisms governing gas fluxes: under UN, fluxes were controlled by a complex interplay of nitrogen substrates, carbon availability, moisture, and temperature, whereas under N0, CH4 uptake exhibited significantly enhanced temperature sensitivity (with Q10 increasing from 1.06 to 7.54) and nitrogen oxide emissions became more dependent on native ammonium and extractable organic carbon. Crucially, nitrogen withdrawal reduced soil ammonium by 37.1% without altering non-nitrogen soil properties, including temperature, moisture, and labile carbon pools. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the concept of nitrogen saturation under conventional fertilization rates. Optimizing these rates presents a significant opportunity to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution while improving nitrogen use efficiency, thereby aligning agricultural production with climate goals and public health objectives without destabilizing short-term soil function.

AB The nitrification inhibitors (NIs) effects on soil nitrogen (N) fates and maize yields were investigated in a loamy-sand soil in Thailand. The treatments were chemical fertilizer (CF) and CF with dicyandiamide (DCD) or neem oil at two rates of 5% and 10%. Compared to the CF plot, DCD and neem oil reduced the cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) emission by the equivalent of 26% and 10%, respectively (P < 0.05). DCD and neem oil had a positive effect in slowing ammonium (NH4+)-conversion and prolonging NH4+-N in the soil with a maximum efficiency of 45% and 30%, respectively. NO3-N was higher in the NI plots (P < 0.05), but the effect was less pronounced later in the growing season. Adding the NIs increased maize yields and N uptake, but was only significant (P < 0.10) for neem oil. Results indicate that applying NIs is an effective method to mitigate soil N losses and enhancing N use efficiency in a tropical, agricultural field.

AB Significant greenhouse gas emissions during substrate cultivation reduces the potential environmental benefits of biogas production. This study investigates the productivity of different cropping systems and their environmental impact in terms of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under the environmental conditions of the coastal marsh regions (Northern Germany) with heavy clay soils, in a 2-year field trial (April 2009-March 2011). Treatments included four cropping systems (perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne, PR) ley, continuous maize (Zea mays), a rotation (CR1) of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum, IR) and maize, and a rotation (CR2) of maize, winter wheat and IR; two sources of N (nitrogen) fertilizers (calcium ammonium nitrate, and biogas residue (BR)), and three levels of N fertilizer applications (control, moderate, high). Nitrous oxide emissions were determined for the unfertilized and highly fertilized cropping systems comprising PR ley, CR1 and CR2. Cumulative annual N2O emissions varied across the treatments, ranging from 0.82 to 3.4 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1). Under high N fertilizer applications, PR ley incurred higher N2O-N losses compared to other tested cropping systems, and IR cover crop caused relatively high N2O-N emissions in a short vegetation period. The study observed wide range of yield-scaled emissions (0.00-5.60 kg N2O-N (Mg DM)(-1)) for different crops, emphasizing the variability in N2O emissions linked to cropping systems. The N2O-N emission factors for the three cropping systems were found to be low to moderate for all treatments, ranging from 0.03% to 0.53% compared to IPCC default Tier 1 N2O-N EFs. The lower emissions in the study were associated with prolonged high soil moisture conditions (water filled pore space >70%.), indicated by its negative correlation with N2O-N fluxes. Low dry matter and N yield of PR and of the wheat-IR sequence after BR application compared to other crops indicated a low N use efficiency. The estimation of N2O-N emissions based on N surplus was not promising specifically for the coastal study site where high groundwater level and organic matter in the soils were the predominant drivers for N2O-N emissions.

AB We assessed nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions at shoulder and foot-slope positions along three sloping sites (1.6-2.1%) to identify the factors controlling the spatial variations in emissions. The three sites received same amounts of total nitrogen (N) input at 170 kg N ha(-1). Results showed that landscape positions had a significant, but not consistent effect on N2O fluxes with larger emission in the foot-slope at only one of the three sites. The effect of soil inorganic N (NH4+ NO3-) contents on N2O fluxes (r(2) = 0.55, p < 0.001) was influenced by water-filled pore space (WFPS). Soil N2O fluxes were related to inorganic N at WFPS > 60% (r(2) = 0.81, p < 0.001), and NH4+ contents at WFPS < 60% (r(2) = 0.40, p < 0.01), respectively. Differences in WFPS between shoulder and foot-slope correlated linearly with differences in N2O fluxes (r(2) = 0.45, p < 0.001). We conclude that spatial variations in N2O emission were regulated by the influence of hydrological processes on soil aeration intensity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stabilised nitrogen (N) fertilisers with nitrification and urease inhibitors have been proposed to abate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agrosystems. Nevertheless, differences in their application and in the management of water and nitrogen rates make it difficult to evaluate their actual utility. The aim of this study was to analyse the possibility for GHG emissions reduction in a 3-year rotation (maize-maize-wheat) by substituting the traditional split-urea application to maize by a single side-dress application of stabilised urea fertiliser. The experiment was performed in 24 drainage lysimeters in two contrasting soil types (Shallow and Deep) under efficient irrigation practices and adjusted N rates under Mediterranean conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were measured using static closed unvented chambers, and the soil mineral N was monitored through periodic soil samplings. CH4 emissions were generally negligible with occasional tendency the soil acting as a sink more than as a net source. Direct N2O emissions during the whole rotation showed lower values when a nitrification inhibitor (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate) was added than with conventional urea (Deep soil: 73% lower, p < 0.05; Shallow soil: 60% lower, ns). Urease inhibitors (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide and monocarbamide dihydrogen sulphate) could not abate direct N2O emissions, and their effect depended on the soil type. However, all stabilised fertilisers mitigated N2O emissions in Deep soil when scaled by grain yield (average 54%). Indirect N2O emissions associated with nitrate leaching were not affected by the treatments but contributed more to total N2O emissions in Shallow soil (12%) than in Deep soil (6%). These results suggest that adequate use of nitrification inhibitors could have environmental benefits without lessening agronomic production.

AB Agricultural practices contribute considerably to emissions of greenhouse gases. So far, knowledge on the impact of organic compared to non-organic farming on soil-derived nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions is limited. We investigated N2O and CH4 fluxes with manual chambers during 571 days in a grass-clover-silage maize - green manure cropping sequence in the long-term field trial "DOK" in Switzerland. We compared two organic farming systems - biodynamic (BIODYN) and bioorganic (BIOORG) - with two non-organic systems - solely mineral fertilisation (CONMIN) and mixed farming including farmyard manure (CONFYM) - all reflecting Swiss farming practices-together with an unfertilised control (NOFERT). We observed a 40.2% reduction of N2O emissions per hectare for organic compared to non-organic systems. In contrast to current knowledge, yield-scaled cumulated N2O emissions under silage maize were similar between organic and non-organic systems. Cumulated on area scale we recorded under silage maize a modest CH4 uptake for BIODYN and CONMIN and high CH4 emissions for CONFYM. We found that, in addition to N input, quality properties such as pH, soil organic carbon and microbial biomass significantly affected N2O emissions. This study showed that organic farming systems can be a viable measure contributing to greenhouse gas mitigation in the agricultural sector.

AB Emission of the greenhouse gas (GHG) nitrous oxide (N2O) are strongly affected by nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rates. However, the role of other nutrients through stoichiometric relations with N has hardly been studied. We tested whether phosphorus (P) availability affects N2O emission. We hypothesized that alleviation of plant P-limitation reduces N2O emission through lowering soil mineral N concentrations.
   We tested our hypothesis in a pot experiment with maize (Zea mays L.) growing on a P-limiting soil/sand mixture. Treatment factors included P and N fertilization and inoculation with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF; which can increase P uptake).
   Both N and P fertilization, as well as their interaction significantly (P < 0.01) affected N2O emission. Highest N2O emissions (2.38 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) were measured at highest N application rates without P fertilization or AMF. At the highest N application rate, N2O fluxes were lowest (0.71 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) with both P fertilization and AMF. The N2O emission factors decreased with 50 % when P fertilization was applied.
   Our results illustrate the importance of the judicious use of all nutrients to minimize N2O emission, and thereby further underline the intimate link between sound agronomic practice and prudent soil GHG management.

AB Ammonia (NH3) volatilization, denitrification loss, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission were investigated from an irrigated wheat-maize rotation field on the North China Plain, and the magnitude of gaseous N loss from denitrification and NH3 volatilization was assessed. The micrometeorological gradient diffusion method in conjunction with a Bowen Ratio system was utilized to measure actual NH3 fluxes over a large area, while the acetylene inhibition technique (intact soil cores) was employed for measurement of denitrification losses and N2O emissions. Ammonia volatilization loss was 26.62% of the applied fertilizer nitrogen (N) under maize, while 0.90% and 15.55% were lost from the wheat field at sowing and topdressing, respectively. The differences in NH3 volatilization between different measurement events may be due to differences between the fertilization methods, and to differences in climatic conditions such as soil temperature. Denitrification losses in the fertilized plots were 0.67%-2.87% and 0.31%-0.49% of the applied fertilizer N under maize and wheat after subtracting those of the controls, respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions in the fertilized plots were approximately 0.08%-0.41% and 0.26%-0.34% of the applied fertilizer N over the maize and wheat seasons after subtracting those of the controls, correspondingly. The fertilizer N losses due to NH3 volatilization were markedly higher than those through denitrification and nitrous oxide emissions. These results indicated that NH3 volatilization was an important N transformation in the, crop-soil system and was likely to be the major cause of low efficiencies with N fertilizer in the study area. Denitrification was not a very important pathway of N fertilizer loss, but did result in important evolution of the greenhouse gas N2O and the effect of N2O emitted from agricultural fields on environment should not be overlooked.

AB Management of agricultural production systems interferes with greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, thereby altering physical, chemical, and biological attributes of soil; therefore, it is important to understand the relationship between soil attributes and GHG emissions. This study evaluated GHG emissions and their relationship with soil attributes in offseason soybean, maize, brachiaria and eucalyptus production systems. The experiment was carried out in Brejo, Maranhao, Brazil, with soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays), brachiaria (Urochloa ruzizienses), and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis). Fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were evaluated using air samples analyzed by gas chromatography. Soil attributes were ammonium and nitrate contents, total organic carbon, moisture, pH, density, total porosity, and water-filled pore space. N2O flux was 287.1 & mu;g m-2 h -1 for eucalyptus cultivation, while areas cultivated with soybeans, maize and brachiaria had influxes of 46.7, 7.2, and 13.17 & mu;g m-2 h-1, respectively. In the off-season, the highest emissions of N2O and CO2 were measured in eucalyptus areas due to soil moisture and porosity conditions provided by accumulation of litter on the soil surface.

AB Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with nitrous oxide (N2O) playing a critical role. In dairy farming, grass-clover (GC) is widely used in crop rotations and often preceding maize, but the period between GC incorporation and maize N uptake has a high risk for environmental losses, including N2O emissions. This study investigated if a nitrification inhibitor, DMPP, can reduce spring N2O emissions from maize after GC on sandy soil with or without cattle slurry (CS) as supplementary N. The inhibitor was applied to GC before incorporation, together with CS, or both. Emissions of N2O and concentrations of N2O at 5, 10, 20 and 30 cm depth were monitored during spring in two years. The highest cumulative emissions were observed in the unamended GC+CS treatment (5.1 and 4.2 kg N ha(-)(1) in 2022 and 2023, respectively). N2O emissions often occurred at < 60 % WFPS, showing that GC residues and liquid manure created anaerobic conditions sustaining emissions. DMPP application to GC did not significantly reduce N2O emissions, possibly due to NO3- derived from roots. Also, N2O accumulation at 20-30 cm was enhanced by CS despite injection to 8 cm depth, suggesting downward transport of NO3-. When applied with cattle slurry, DMPP effectively reduced emissions by an average 71 %, with some treatments even exhibiting net negative emissions. These findings highlight the complexity of soil N dynamics after termination of GC pastures and the importance of management strategies to mitigate this source of N2O emissions in dairy farming systems.

AB The effect of biochar application on nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from an arable soil amended with maize leaves was studied in a laboratory experiment using soil samples collected from plots with three different fertiliser treatments: no fertilisation (CONT), mineral fertiliser (NPKMg) and farmyard manure (FYM), of a well characterized agricultural experiment established in 1949. Two biochars (BC) used in the experiment were produced in low temperature slow (BCslow) and in high temperature fast (BCfast) pyrolysis, and applied at a rate of 10 t ha(-1). Different fertilisation strategies induced significant differences in the soil total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents (CONT < NPKMg < FYM), but at the time of the soil sample collection the soil contained low levels of plant-available nitrogen (<10 mg kg(-1) N soil) independent of the fertilisation treatment. A stable suppressive effect of BCslow but not BCfast application on N2O emissions was found for maize leaves-amended soil. The short-term effect of residue application on N2O emission was much stronger than the 60-year difference in the soil fertilisation strategy. Mixing of biochar with maize leaves and the soil was in general more efficient in reducing N2O emissions than biochar application in layers. Neither of the studied ways of biochar application to the soils systematically reduced CO2 emissions. Compared to BCslow application of thermally more labile BCfast. with wider oxygen and carbon (O:C) and hydrogen and carbon (H:C) ratios did not systematically reduce N2O emissions and increased CO2 fluxes from the soils, underpinning the role of biochar stability and composition for controlling plant residue-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

AB Agricultural soils are a significant anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. Despite likely having large emissions of N2O, there are no continuous multi-year studies of emissions from poorly drained floodplain soil. In the present study, the micrometeorological flux of N2O (E-N) was measured over three years (2006-2008) in a maize (Zea mays L.)/faba (Vicia faba minor L.)/spring-wheat (Triticum aestivum L) rotation in the Red River Valley, Manitoba, Canada on a gleyed humic verticol soil. Comparison of newly established reduced and intensive tillage treatments showed no difference in F-N within the constraints of the high variability between duplicate plots. The annual gap-filled Sigma F-N across tillage treatments was 5.5, 1.4, and 4.3 kg N ha(-1) in the maize, faba, and spring-wheat crop years, respectively. Emissions from fertilizer N addition and soil thaw the following spring was responsible for the greater Sigma F-N in the maize and spring-wheat years. Using four approaches to approximate background Sigma F-N resulted in estimates of 3.5-3.8% and 1.4-1.8% of applied fertilizer N emitted as N2O for the maize and spring-wheat crops, respectively. The CO2 global warming potential equivalent of Sigma F-N over the three study years was an emission of 5.4 Mg CO2-equiv. ha(-1) which adds to the previously determined C balance emission of 11.6 Mg CO2-equiv. ha(-1).

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a long-lived greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Emissions of N2O mainly stem from agricultural soils. This review highlights the principal factors from peer-reviewed literature affecting N2O emissions from agricultural soils, by grouping the factors into three categories: environmental, management and measurement. Within these categories, each impact factor is explained in detail and its influence on N2O emissions from the soil is summarized. It is also shown how each impact factor influences other impact factors. Process-based simulation models used for estimating N2O emissions are reviewed regarding their ability to consider the impact factors in simulating N2O. The model strengths and weaknesses in simulating N2O emissions from managed soils are summarized. Finally, three selected process-based simulation models (Daily Century (DAYCENT), DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)) are discussed that are widely used to simulate N2O emissions from cropping systems. Their ability to simulate N2O emissions is evaluated by describing the model components that are relevant to N2O processes and their representation in the model.

AB Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and carbon (C) sequestration are important processes for determining net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maize fields. Farming management practices (FMPs) substantially affect crop productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), and N2O emissions. However, relative knowledge is not sufficient, and further research is required for sustainable agriculture development. A multiyear experiment was performed on a spring maize field in the North China Plain (NCP) to quantify changes in SOC stocks, N2O emissions, and maize yields. Seven treatments were involved in the experiment, including no N fertilization (CK), farmers' conventional N fertilization (FP), sole application of manure N (M), a combination of M and FP (MFP), FP combined with returned maize straw (SFP), fertilization with reduced synthetic N amount (RN), and fertilization with both reduced synthetic and manure N (RMN). The field measurements demonstrated that urea applications and returned maize straw increased N2O emission. The seasonal total N2O emissions under FP were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those under CK by 176% to 222% and lower than those under SFP by 20% to 61% throughout the three maize growing seasons. The application of organic manure or maize straw enhanced SOC storage for the studied cropping system. The SOC stocks were relatively high in the plots that received applications of organic manure or maize straw, with the SOC stock of the M plot being significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the CK, FP, SFP, RN, and RMN plots in 2016 after eight years of manure amendments. The average net GHG emission from 2012 to 2014 was 203 kg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) year(-1) (i.e., a net GHG source) under FP. The other treatments converted the maize fields from net GHG sources to GHG sinks. By considering both the maize yields and net GHG emissions, RMN would be an optimal management option, although MFP, SFP, and RN also mitigated the GHG emissions and maintained the yields. Large variations were observed in the contributions of the SOC changes and N2O emissions to net GHG emissions among the treatments. The large variations demonstrate the need to consider both SOC changes and N2O emissions when evaluating the impacts of alternative FMPs on net GHG emissions.

AB It is increasingly recognized that the addition of biochar to soil has potential to mitigate climate change and increase soil fertility by enhancing carbon (C) storage. However, the effect of biochar on yield and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from upland fields remains unclear. In this study, a one-year field experiment was conducted in an area of calcareous fluvo-aquic soil to assess and quantify the effect of maize straw biochar in reducing N2O loss during 2014-2015 in the North China Plain. Eight treatments were designed as follows: no nitrogen (N) fertilizer (control, CK); biochar application at rates of 3 (B3), 6 (B6) and 12 (B12) t ha(-1); chemical fertilizer (NPK) application at 200 kg N ha(-1) (F); and fertilizer plus biochar application at rates of 3 (FB3), 6 (FB6) and 12 (FB12) t ha(-1). Crop yield, N2O fluxes, soil mineral N concentrations, and soil auxiliary parameters were measured following the application of treatments during each season. During the maize growing season, N2O emission was 0.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1) under CK treatment, and increased to 0.88, 0.93 and 1.10 kg N2O-N ha(-1) under B3, B6 and B12, respectively. In contrast, N2O emissions were significantly reduced by 31.4-39.9% (P < 0.05) under FB treatments compared with F, and the N2O emission factor of the applied N was reduced from 1.36% under F to 0.71 -0.85% under FB. There was also a significant interaction effect of fertilizer and biochar on N2O emissions (P < 0.01). During the wheat growing season, biochar had no effect on N2O emissions regardless of the fertilizer regime. Biochar application did not affect maize yield; however, a significant increase in wheat yield of 16.6-25.9% (P < 0.05) was observed without N fertilization. Nevertheless, a reduction in wheat yield was measured at a biochar rate of 12 t ha(-1) with fertilization. Overall, under maize cropping, N2O emissions per unit yield of grain, biomass, grain N and biomass N (yield-scaled N2O emissions) were significantly reduced by 32.4-39.9% under FB compared with F treatment, regardless of the biochar application rate. Biochar did not affect yield-scaled N2O emissions in wheat. Decreased soil bulk density with biochar is suggested to reduce the denitrification potential and N2O emissions; while increased retention capacity of fertilizer N in biochar-added soil decreased wheat growth and yield. These findings suggest that N fertilization plus biochar application at 3 t ha(-1) is a practical strategy for reducing yield scaled N2O emissions from maize fields in the North China Plain.

AB Biogas slurry (BS) produced from anaerobic digestion of livestock manure can be benefit for crop yields and soil fertility in cropping systems as compared to sole synthetic fertilization, but its impact on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is inconsistent in the literatures. The North China Plain (NCP) serves as a vital agricultural region in China, contributing approximately 40 % of the nation's total wheat and maize production. However, owing to the lack of relevant field studies, the understanding of how BS affects crop yield and N2O emissions in NCP remains unclear. Here, we assessed the effects of BS substitution (0 % substitution, CF; 50 % substitution, 50%BS; 100 % substitution, 100%BS) on the amount and sources of N2O emissions by monitoring N2O fluxes combined with the isotopomer ratios of soil-derived N2O in the NCP. The results showed that, compared with the control, CF, 50 % BS, and 100 % BS significantly increased wheat grain yield by 66.1 %-67.9 % and silage maize yield by 46.3 %-53.3 %, respectively. Compared with CF, 50%BS reduced N2O emissions by 40.1 % in the wheat season and by 35.5 % maize season, while 100%BS reduced N2O emissions by 31.9 % in the wheat season and by 49.2 % in the maize season. Further site preference analysis revealed that nitrification and fungal denitrification together contributed to 40.3-44.9 % of the peak N2O emissions in CF, 50%BS, and 100%BS, with no significant differences in SP values among them. Compared with CF, 100%BS significantly reduced the copy numbers of AOBamoA, nirK, and nirS by 65 %, 41 %, and 35 %, respectively, which may be key factors in reducing N2O emissions. Our results showed that the partial substitution of chemical fertilizers with BS is an efficacious practice for maintaining crop yields while simultaneously reducing N2O emissions in the NCP.

AB The agricultural area in the Po Valley is prone to high nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions as it is characterized by irrigated maize-based cropping systems, high amounts of nitrogen supplied, and elevated air temperature in summer. Here, two monitoring campaigns were carried out in maize fertilized with raw digestate in a randomized block design in 2016 and 2017 to test the effectiveness of the 3, 4 DMPP inhibitor Vizura (R) on reducing N2O-N emissions. Digestate was injected into 0.15 m soil depth at side-dressing (2016) and before sowing (2017). Non-steady state chambers were used to collect N2O-N air samples under zero N fertilization (N0), digestate (D), and digestate + Vizura (R) (V). Overall, emissions were significantly higher in the D treatment than in the V treatment in both 2016 and 2017. The emission factor (EF, %) of V was two and four times lower than the EF in D in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Peaks of NO3-N generally resulted in N2O-N emissions peaks, especially during rainfall or irrigation events. The water-filled pore space (WFPS, %) did not differ between treatments and was generally below 60%, suggesting that N2O-N emissions were mainly due to nitrification rather than denitrification.

AB There is evidence that forage grasses such as Megathyrsus and Urochloa can suppress nitrification, with direct or indirect consequences on soil inorganic N dynamics and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the influence of soil chemical properties on the dynamics of functional N-genes and losses of N in maize (Zea mays L.) inter cropped with forage grasses under N fertilization is poorly understood. In this study, soil samples and N2O emissions were analyzed from a field experiment in which maize (fertilized or not with ammonium-based fertilizer) was intercropped with Guinea grass (M. maximus cv. Tanzania), palisade grass (U. brizantha cv. Marandu), and ruzigrass (U. ruziziensis cv. Comum). Soil N-cycle microorganisms [16S rRNA of bacteria and archaea, nifH (gene encoding N2-fixing bacteria), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), nirS (encoding nitrite reductase), and nosZ (encoding nitrous oxide reductase)] were influenced by forage grass, N fertilization, and sampling time, but no evidence of biological nitrification inhibition was found. Palisade grass was associated with a higher abundance of nifH (7.0 x 105 gene copies g-1 soil, on average) in the absence of N compared with the other grasses (4.3 x 105 gene copies g-1 soil, on average). Nitrogen fertilization increased the abundance of AOB but not AOA. Furthermore, N2O flux was influenced by AOB, water-filled pore space, and N fertilization, whereas the cumulative N2O emission and fertilizer-induced emission factor (0.36%, on average) were not affected by the grasses. In conclusion, this study reveals the strong dominance of AOB under ammonium supply, potentially stimulating N2O emissions in maize-forage grass intercropping systems.

AB The grain-economic cropping system combines grain production with economic benefits. Under this system, decreasing the N2O emissions from farmland soil will be more conducive to the development of green agriculture. Therefore, we determined the soil N2O emissions and ecological benefits of garlic-maize and wheat-maize cropping systems from 2019 to 2020. Compared with wheat-maize, garlic-maize significantly decreased the soil urease activity and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) content, which significantly decreased the N2O emission fluxes by 44.6% and 36.4% in the crop growing seasons during 2019-2020, respectively, thereby indicating that planting garlic could effectively inhibit the soil N2O emissions. Moreover, garlic enhanced the ecological benefits of the planting system by 2.1 times as an economic crop. Path analysis showed that the soil temperature, waterfilled pore spaces, and DIN significantly promoted soil N2O emissions in the wheat-maize system but weakened them in the garlic-maize system. However, the urease activity significantly affected the DIN content, which indicates that garlic could significantly decrease DIN production by inhibiting the urease activity to reduce N2O emissions. Our findings demonstrate that garlic can be used as an environmentally friendly economic crop to optimize planting systems.

AB Dairy effluents instead of mineral fertilizer can realize nutrients recycling while urease inhibitors have been proposed as fertilizer amendments to maximize nutrients utilization and reduce negative environmental effects. However, studies on the impacts of dairy effluent combined with urease inhibitors on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions remain limited. Here, a 2-year field trail with maize was conducted in a sandy soil with four treatments: no nitrogen (N) fertilizer (Control), mineral N fertilizer urea (NPK), fermented dairy effluent as liquid fertilizer (LF), and LF plus urease inhibitor hydroquinone (LFHQ). Cumulative N2O emission in the NPK treatment was 0.44 kg N ha-1 during the 2021 maize season while drastically increased to 5.21 kg N ha-1 during the 2022 maize season with extreme precipitation occurred, while NO emission reduced from 0.65 to 0.17 kg N ha-1. Compared with the NPK treatment, N2O and NO emissions in the LF treatment decreased by 38.6% and 29.2%, and by 38.8% and 6.4% during the 2021 and 2022 maize seasons, respectively. Compared with the LF treatment, the LFHQ treatment increased N2O emissions by 40.7% and 21.7% during the 2021 and 2022 maize seasons, respectively. The N2O emission factors (EF-N2O) of applied N was 0.90-1.71% during the 2022 maize season, which was ten times greater than the 2021 maize season. We further evaluated correlation between EF-N2O of mineral N fertilizer and annual precipitation in temperate sandy soils by compiling published literature, suggesting that there was a quadratic relationship between EF-N2O and precipitation, with the highest EF-N2O occurring at similar to 690 mm of precipitation. Accordingly, extreme precipitation would induce explosive N2O emissions at optimal scenario. Overall, our results suggest that replacing mineral fertilizers with dairy effluent mitigated N2O and NO emissions while heavy rainfall could cause N2O paroxysmal emission. Thus, rational water management in temperate farms is particularly required to avoid N2O surge emission after heavy rainfall events, and urease inhibitors co-application with nitrification inhibitors are recommended under dairy effluent application.

AB Global agriculture is the largest anthropogenic source for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. During crop rotations, periods with arable soils without crops, thereafter called "bare soils" are often impossible to avoid after the crop is harvested, prior to sowing of the next crop. However, such periods are underrepresented in studies focussing on N2O emissions. Here, we present continuous, high-temporal-resolution N2O fluxes during bare soil periods after four major crops, using the eddy-covariance technique at two sites in Switzerland. Overall, periods with bare soil were net sources for N2O as well as for carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Daily average sums of N2O emissions varied between 10 +/- 2 and 38 +/- 5 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) after the respective rapeseed, winter wheat, pea, and maize harvests. While CO2 emissions contributed 86-96% to the total GHG budgets, N2O fluxes accounted for 2% after pea, but for 10-12% after rapeseed, winter wheat, and maize. In contrast, CH4 fluxes were negligible (< 2%). N2O fluxes during bare soil periods increased for all cropland sites with increasing water-filled pore space, particularly at high soil temperatures. Thus, our study emphasizes the significance of avoiding bare soil periods to mitigate N2O emissions from croplands.

AB Irrigation management may influence soil greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Solid-set sprinkler irrigation systems allow to modify the irrigation time and frequency. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of two irrigation times (daytime, D; nighttime, N) and two irrigation frequencies (low, L; high, H) on soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a solid-set sprinkler-irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) field located in NE Spain during 2015 and 2016 growing seasons and the fallow period between growing seasons. Compared with D irrigation, N irrigation increased soil water content (0-5 cm) in both growing seasons. Irrigation management did not affect CH4 emissions and the soil acted as a sink of CH4. Cumulative CO2 emissions were affected by the measurement period (growing season vs fallow) with the greatest values in 2015 growing season, being 81 and 32% higher over the fallow period and over the 2016 growing season, respectively, due to the effect of the preceding crop, alfalfa, and a better soil moisture conditions for the microorganism activity. Similarly, cumulative N2O emissions showed the highest values in 2015, reporting values 90 and 51% greater than the fallow period and the 2016 growing season, respectively. Moreover, N irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions by 29% compared with D irrigation, but irrigation frequency did not affect cumulative N2O emissions. Irrigation time did not affect cumulative N2O emissions scaled per grain yield or per N uptake because N irrigation increased maize yield by 11% compared with D irrigation. Due to the lack of differences in the scaled N2O emissions, N irrigation should be consider as an appropriate strategy to optimize grain yield without compromising soil GHG emissions per unit of grain yield in Mediterranean agroecosystems.

AB Aims: To assess how biochar addition in rainfed conservation agriculture affects short-term transformation, plant uptake, retention of nitrogen (N) in soil, and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in a tropical Arenosol planted to maize. Methods: A ten-day in situ(15)N pool dilution and N cycling experiment, using tracer amounts (0.1 g m(-2)) of N-15 labeled ammonium ((NH4+)-N-15), nitrate ((NO3-)-N-15) or N-15-urea, was carried out seven weeks after planting of maize (Zea mays L.) under conservation agriculture in Zambia, using planting basins without (CA) and with pigeon-pea biochar (BC) addition (4 t ha(-1)). Results: Pigeon-pea biochar increased soil NO3- concentration, gross nitrification rate, N-15 recovery in extractable soil NO3-, and soil moisture. However, effects of biochar on soil N retention and plant N uptake were not significant. Likewise, biochar did not affect N2O fluxes. Conclusions: At low dosage, pigeon pea biochar has a positive effect on gross nitrification rate but does not affect short-term N retention in soil, N2O fluxes, nor does it help increasing the uptake of N by maize.

AB European policy recommends that biomass production occur on marginal land, such as poorly draining Stagnosols. Compared to annual cropping, perennial crops may better mitigate N2O emissions at such sites, through more complete denitrification. To test that hypothesis, we compared N-2 and N2O fluxes from the soils of a perennial crop (cup plant, Silphium perfoliatum L.) and an annual crop (silage maize, Zea mays L.). Intact soil columns (35 cm height, 14.4 cm diameter) were incubated for 37 days. The soils were fertilized with 60 or 120 kg N ha(-1) and exposed to successive phases of waterlogging: free drainage, waterlogging of 1/3-, and waterlogging of 2/3- of the column. Source-specific N2O and N-2 fluxes were measured using the (15) N gas flux method. Denitrification was higher in cup plant than maize soil and total N losses from denitrification were dominated by emissions from the third phase. Cup plant soil emitted 33.6 +/- 78.1 mg N m(-2) and 95.8 +/- 64.4 mg N m(-2) more N2O than maize soil in the low and high N treatments, respectively. The product ratio of denitrification (N(2)Oi = N2O/(N-2 + N2O)) increased with waterlogging in maize soil, while remaining stable in cup plant soil. Emissions from the top 10 cm dominated the N(2)Oi rather than N-2 fluxes from the saturated soil. This study did not show N2O mitigation in cup plant soil, instead highlighting the complexity of plant-soil effects on denitrification. We clearly showed that the application of a general N(2)Oi for agricultural soils across annual and perennial cropping is not recommended.

AB A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influences of long-term applications of organic amendments and chemical fertilizers on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from Mollisols in northeast China and to relate soil N2O fluxes to soil moisture and temperature. A closed-chamber method was used to determine soil N2O flux during the maize growing season in 2011. In the entire maize growing period, cumulative N2O emissions were significantly (all P < 0.05) increased by 66, 86 and 83% under the applications of 4.5 Mg ha(-1) maize straw combined with NPK, 7.5 and 22.5 Mg ha(-1) pig manure combined with NPK, respectively, compared with the control (0.64 +/- 0.01 kg N2O-N ha(-1)), whereas NPK fertilizer alone and 2.25 Mg ha(-1) maize straw combined with NPK had no remarkable influences (P > 0.05). Nonetheless, even increasing nitrogen inputs, the cumulative microbial N2O emission over 126 days had an upper threshold around 1.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Approximately 25-44% of N2O was emitted from the applied organic amendments, and the emission factor (EF) of applied organic amendments as N2O based on 126 days was between 0.07 and 1.52%, higher than NPK fertilizer-induced EF (0.03%). Soil temperature explained 38-96% of the seasonal variation in soil N2O fluxes using exponential models, with a Q(10) of 2.01-3.48. Our results suggest that the influences of organic amendments on soil N2O emissions from Mollisols primarily vary with the type of the applied organic amendments, whereas great nitrogen inputs at maximum asymptotically double baseline cumulative emissions.

AB With increasing attention being placed on mitigating global warming and achieving agricultural sustainable intensification, conservation agriculture practices have gradually been implemented in the North China Plain (NCP). However, there are still knowledge gaps on the effects of conservation practices on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this area. In this study, a four-year field experiment was conducted from 2014 to 2018 to assess the effects of tillage and crop residue management practices on the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Subsequently, crop yields, area-scaled and yield-scaled total non-carbon dioxide (CO2) GHG emissions were assessed. Our research found that no till (NT) decreased N2O emissions by 22.6% compared with conventional tillage (CT) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seasons, but there was no difference between tillage practices in summer maize (Zea mays L.) seasons. Crop residue retention practice (+R) increased N2O emissions by 28.1% and 26.7% compared with residue removal practice (-R) in winter wheat and summer maize seasons, respectively. The NT soils took up more CH4 compared with the CT soils in summer maize seasons. Area-scaled total non-CO2 GHG emissions showed trends similar to those of N2O emission. Since crop residue retention improved the maize yield compared with the residue removal treatments, yield scaled total non-CO2 GHGs emission did not differ between residue management practices in summer maize seasons. Our four-year field measurements indicated that no-till practice could be more useful as an option to mitigate non-CO2 GHG emissions in the wheat - maize cropping system.

AB The nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of maize is usually below 60%. Considering future food supply and climate change, selective breeding of maize with high nitrogen (N)-efficient varieties, covering genetic diversities, is an effective strategy for identifying specific elements for controlling NUE and productivity per arable farming unit while reducing environmental damage. This study evaluated the yield and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission of 30 maize varieties under two different N doses of 57.5 kg N ha-1 (N1, N-sufficient) and 173 kg N ha-1 (N3, N-high) applied in two equal splits on 2 and 4 weeks after germination (WAG). Then, the tested maize varieties were categorized into four groups based on the grain yield and cumulative N2O, that is, efficientefficient (EE) under both N1 and N3, high-N efficient (HNE) under N3 only, low-N efficient (LNE) under N1 only, and nonefficient-nonefficient (NN) under neither N1 nor N3. Maize yield was significantly positively correlated with shoot biomass, N-accumulation, and kernel-number under N1 and with N2O-flux at 5 WAG, NH4+, shoot biomass, and all of yield components under N3, whereas cumulative N2O showed a significant positive correlation with NO3- under N3 only and with N2O flux at 3 WAG under both N levels. The EE generally showed higher grain yield, yield components, N-accumulation, dry matter accumulation, root volume, and NH4+ in soil and lower cumulative N2O and NO3- in soil relative to NN maize varieties. The EE variety groups of maize can be a feasible strategy for increasing N fertilizer efficiency without reducing maize production as well as decrease the negative impact of N lost in agricultural system.

AB Fertilizer application often significantly affects soil quality and crop productivity, thus, can affect soil green-house gas (GHG) emissions and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) as well. However, the impacts have not been well documented under double maize cropping system in subtropical China. Based on a thirty-year field experiment with five fertilization treatments (i.e. no fertilizer (CK), organic manure (OM), N, NPK and NPK plus OM (NPKM)), maize cultivar (Yedan 13) was planted both at the early maize season and late maize season, we assessed the impacts of different fertilizer application on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions, grain yield and NUE. Compared to the NPK, manure application (i.e. OM and NPKM) significantly increased N2O emissions, and maize yield. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in yield-scaled global warming potential (GWP) among NPK, OM, and NPKM. Manure application increased soil pH, soil organic carbon, and soil total N, suggesting it can improve soil quality. The NPKM treatment had the highest N uptake, but in terms of NUE, it was lower than OM, due to double N application. Our results suggest that manure application can compensate its negative impacts on N2O emission through improving soil quality, maize yield and N use efficiency.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) derived from agricultural activity is a major contributor to Earth's greenhouse effect. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizer applied at high levels, particularly combined with heavy rainfall events, generates hot spots of N2O emissions in agricultural fields due to the process of microbial denitrification. Here, a key conserved fungal denitrification enzyme necessary for N2O emissions was identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that fungal NOR1-like genes, with rare exceptions, are highly conserved and confined to the phylum Ascomycota. Plant pathogenic Fusarium species that possess NOR1 exhibited drastic differences in N2O production based on denitrification potential. Functional characterization of the p450nor nitric oxide reductase encoding gene, NOR1, in the soil-borne denitrifying maize pathogen, Fusarium verticillioides, showed that this enzyme is critical for fungal N2O production. Deletion of the single copy NOR1 gene in F. verticillioides eliminated N2O emissions. Complementation of deletion mutants via the NOR1 gene add-back restored wild type N2O emission levels and segregation analysis further corroborated the pivotal role of NOR1 for N2O emissions. We suggest targeting of the NOR1 enzyme as an effective strategy to reduce fungal-based N2O emissions.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a maize field in the North China Plain (Wangdu County, Hebei Province, China) were investigated using static chambers during two consecutive maize growing seasons in the 2008 and 2009. The N2O pulse emissions occurred with duration of about 10 days after basal and additional fertilizer applications in the both years. The average N2O fluxes from the CK (control plot, without crop, fertilization and irrigation), NP (chemical N fertilizer), SN (wheat straw returning plus chemical N fertilizer), OM-1/2N (chicken manure plus half chemical N fertilizer) and OMN (chicken manure plus chemical N fertilizer) plots in 2008 were 8.51, 72.1, 76.6, 101, 107 ng N/(m(2).sec), respectively, and in 2009 were 33.7, 30.0 and 35.0 ng N/(m(2).sec) from CK, NP and SN plots, respectively. The emission factors of the applied fertilizer as N2O-N (EFs) were 3.8% (2008) and 1.1% (2009) for the NP plot, 3.2% (2008) and 1.2% (2009) for the SN plot, and 2.8% and 2.2% in 2008 for the OM-1/2N and OMN plots, respectively. Hydromorphic properties of the investigated soil (with gley) are in favor of denitrification. The large differences of the soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) between the two maize seasons were suspected to be responsible for the significant yearly variations. Compared with the treatments of NP and SN, chicken manure coupled with compound fertilizer application significantly reduced fertilizer loss rate as N2O-N.

DE cotton; foliage; greenhouse gas; maize; nitrous oxide; soybean
AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming. Most of the N2O emitted from cropping systems is derived from the soil and is closely related to the use of nitrogen (N) fertiliser. However, several reports have shown that small, yet significant, portions of the N2O flux from cropping systems are emitted from the crop foliage. This research aimed to quantify N2O emissions from the foliage of field-grown cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), and included maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) for comparison. We also aimed to identify differences in the timing of N2O emissions from foliage during the day and over an irrigation cycle. Individual plants were isolated from the soil, and the atmosphere surrounding the encapsulated plants was sampled over a 30-min period. Subplots that were previously fertilised with urea at 0, 80, 160, 240 and 320kg N ha(-1) and then sown to cotton were used to measure N2O flux from plants on three occasions. N2O flux from cotton foliage was also measured on five occasions during an 11-day irrigation cycle and at five times throughout one day. N2O flux from foliage accounted for a small but significant portion (13-17%) of the soil-crop N2O flux. N2O flux from foliage varied with plant species, and the time of day the flux was measured. N2O flux from cotton plants was closely related to soil water content. Importantly, the application of N fertiliser was not related to the N2O flux from cotton plants. The most plausible explanation of our results is that a proportion of the N2O that was evolved in the soil was transported through the plant via evapotranspiration, rather than being evolved within the plant. Studies that exclude N2O emissions from crop foliage will significantly underestimate the N2O flux from the system.

AB Changing precipitation has the potential to alter nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural regions. In this study, we applied the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 end-of-century RCP 8.5 (business as usual) precipitation projections for the U.S. Upper Midwest and examined the effects of mean precipitation changes, characterized by increased early-season rainfall and decreased mid- to late-season rainfall, on N2O emissions from a conventionally managed corn (Zea mays L.) cropping system grown in an indoor mesocosm facility over four growing seasons. We also assessed the response of N2O emissions to over 1,000 individual rain events. Nitrous oxide emissions were most strongly correlated with water-filled pore space (WFPS) and soil nitrogen (N) status. After rain events, the change in N2O emissions, relative to pre-rain emissions, was more likely to be positive when soil NO3- was >40 mg N kg(-1) soil and soil NH4+ was >10 mg N kg(-1) soil and was more likely to be negative when soil NO3- was >40 mg N kg(-1) soil and soil NH4+ was <10 mg N kg(-1) soil. Similarly, hourly N2O emissions remained (-)(2) s(-1) when combined NH4+ + NO3- was <20 mg N kg(-1) soil or NH4+ and NO3- were <5 and 20 mg N kg(-1) soil, respectively. Rain event magnitude did not substantially affect the change in N2O flux. Finally, growing-season N2O emissions, soil moisture, and inorganic N content were not affected by the future precipitation pattern. Near-optimal soil WFPS combined with soil N concentrations above the identified thresholds favor higher N2O emissions.

AB Substituting synthetic fertilizers with manures in agriculture enhances soil properties and crop yield. However, the impact on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, especially from the soil profile, remains poorly understood. This study examined emissions from 2017 to 2019 on a well-established (>10-year) maize field site in the North China Plain. Three treatments were compared: 100 % synthetic nitrogen (NPK), 50 % synthetic fertilizer N + 50 % manure N substitution (50%MNS), and 100 % manure N substitution (100%MNS). N2O emissions were monitored for three years, and in 2019, N2O concentrations at 20 cm and 40 cm soil depths were analyzed in relation to surface N2O fluxes and environmental factors. The results showed manure substitution resulted in about 13.8 %-25.2 % (50%MNS) and 40.3 %-72.2 % (100%MNS) reduction in N2O emissions over the 3-year period compared with the NPK treatment. Throughout the maize growing season, the top-dressing accompanied by rainfall was responsible for the N2O emissions. The difference in N2O concentrations between all the treatments at 20 cm depth was insignificant, but at 40 cm depth the N2O concentrations were significantly higher for the 50%MNS treatment than the other treatments. The N2O fluxes and N2O concentration were not synchronized especially in NPK. The decoupled relationship between the N2O fluxes and the N2O concentration in the soil profile depth suggested the contribution of N2O produced in the soil profile to the surface N2O fluxes is limited. This study highlights that manure substitution is an efficient measure to reduce N2O emissions.

AB The aim of the study was a comparison of nitrous oxide emissions (N2O) from cultivation of selected crops in Poland in the years 2005-2015. The analyses included maize, sugar beet, rape and potato. The cultivation areas of these plants in the analysed period have been changed, among other things as a result of the implementation of a regulation governing production of biofuel in the European Union (EU). The calculation of N2O emissions was performed according to the Tier 1 method of the IPCC using the BioGrace calculator based on the farm data of 2015 year. The total N2O emissions expressed in kg N2O per hectare were as follows: maize - 4, rape - 4.17, sugar beet - 4.3 and potato - 5.89. Direct N2O fluxes amounted to 3.09, 3.33, 3.23 and 4.3 kg N2O ha(-1), respectively for maize, sugar beet, rape and potato. It was found that growth of maize and rape cultivation area increased N2O emissions by 98 and 72 %, respectively. Whereas decline of sugar beet and potato area decreased N2O emissions by 37 and 49 %. The implementation regulations on environmental protection in Poland caused decreased N2O emissions from 4.7 to 4.4 kg N2O ha(-1), which means 10 % drop from analysed crops area.

AB Assessment of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission factor (EF) for N2O emission inventory from arable crops fertilized with different nitrogen sources are under increased scrutiny because of discrepancies between the default IPCC EFs and low EFs reported by many researchers. Mixing ratio of leguminous and non leguminous cover crop residues incorporation and plastic film mulching (PFM) in upland soil has been recommended as a vital agronomic practice to enhance yield and soil quality. However, how these practices together affect N2O emissions, yield-scaled emissions and the EFs remain uncertain. Field experiments spanning two consecutive years were conducted to evaluate the effects of PFM on N2O emissions, yield-scaled emissions and the seasonal EFs in cover crop residues amended soil during maize cultivation. The mixture of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) seeds with 75% recommended dose (RD 140 kg ha(-1)) and 25% recommended dose (RD 90 kg ha(-1)), respectively, were broadcasted during the fallow period and 0, 25, 50 and 100% of the total aboveground harvested biomass that correspond to 0, 76, 152 and 304 kg N ha(-1) were incorporated before maize transplanting. It was found that the mean seasonal EFs from cover crop residues amended soil under No-mulching (NM) and PFM were 1.13% (ranging from 0.81 to 1.23%) and 1.49% (ranging from 1.02 to 1.63%), respectively, which are comparable to the IPCC (2006) default EF (1%) for emission inventories of N2O from crop residues. The emission fluxes were greatly influenced by NH4+-N, NOT-N, DOC and DON contents of soil. The cumulative N2O emissions markedly increased with the increase in cover crop residues application rates and it was more prominent under PFM than under NM. However, the yield-scaled emissions markedly decreased under PFM compared to NM due to the improved yield. With relatively low yield-scaled N2O emissions, 25% biomass mixing ratio of barley and hairy vetch (76 kg N ha(-1)) under PFM could be recommended to enhance yield and to mitigate N2O emissions in an upland maize cropping system.

AB Fertilizer application and tillage practices play an important role in agricultural production, whereas excess N input could create considerable N2O emissions. However, it is unclear whether urea types under subsoiling or rotary tillage have effects on yield and N2O emissions in maize field. We investigated the effects on N2O emissions and maize (Zea mays L.) yield of tillage (rotary tillage [R] alone and rotary tillage following subsoiling [S]) and two types of urea (polymer-coated urea [P] and conventional urea [C]) applications, respectively, at the sowing [0] and V6 [6] stages in a clay loam soil. N2O emissions varied from 1 to 11 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Compared with S soil, the R soils produced greater N2O emissions. Compared with conventional urea, polymer-coated urea increased maize production and fertilizer-induced N2O emission, but had no significant effect on yield scaled N2O emission. The increase of N2O emission was mainly related to water-filled pore space affected by tillage and soil nitrate and ammonium N concentrations affected by urea types. Polymer-coated urea topdressing at the V6 stage in S soils was better for producing a higher yield with lower N2O emission. The results indicate that R soils had more significant N2O emission than S soils during a wet climate; and polymer-coated urea can increase grain yield with a slight higher N2O emissions, whereas changing the application stage can decrease the cumulative N2O emissions without reducing the yield.

AB Although it is known that crops can directly emit N2O, their contribution to the total N2O emission from crop-soil systems under field conditions is not well understood. This study was conducted to study the contribution of crops to total N2O emission from soybean-soil and maize-soil systems in northeastern China. The effects of N fertilization on N2O emission and NO3--N concentration in plants were also studied. The emission from crop-soil systems was measured with the closed chamber method, whereas the direct emission from crops was measured with the soil surface-sealed method. The addition of fertilizer N significantly increased the NO3--N concentration in crops and enhanced the N2O emission from crop-soil systems and from crops alone. The amount of N2O emitted directly from soybean plants accounted for 6 to 11% of the total soybean-soil emission. Similarly, the amount of N2O emitted directly from maize plants accounted for 8.5 to 16% of the total maize-soil emission. The proportion of the applied N lost through direct N2O emission from plants ranged from 0.19 to 0.34%, whereas the proportion of the applied N lost through N2O emission from the crop-soil system ranged from 1.1 to 1.9%. These results suggest that the use of chambers that do not include plants may lead to an underestimation of the total N2O emission from crop-soil systems.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of different crop sequences (soybean-corn and soybean-soybean) and tillage systems (no tillage and reduced tillage) on nitrous oxide (N2O) soil emissions under field conditions. The experiment was carried out in Manfredi, Crdoba province, Argentina on an Entic Haplustoll and N2O emissions were measured in the field during a year. N2O fluxes were low during winter, but in late spring it peaked. For fallow, N-NO3-content was the most important variable to explain N2O emissions. For growing period water-filled pores was the main variable explaining N2O emissions. Nitrogen fertilization of corn crop increased N2O-N emissions, whereas no significant differences were found due to the tillage system. Measured annual N2O-N emissions were generally lower than those calculated using the methodology proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

TI Mitigating nitrous oxide emissions from a maize-cropping black soil in
   northeast China by a combination of reducing chemical N fertilizer
   application and applying manure in autumn

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils, mainly caused by chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs, are major sources of N2O in Chinese terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, attempts to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils by optimizing N applications are receiving increasing attention. Further, organic fertilizers are being increasingly used in China to improve crop production/quality and prevent or reduce soil degradation. However, organic and chemical fertilizers are often both applied in spring in northeast China, which promotes N2O emissions and may be sub-optimal. Therefore, we hypothesized that reducing applications of chemical fertilizer N and applying manure in autumn could be an effective strategy for mitigating N2O emissions from cropped soils in the region. To test this hypothesis, we established a field trial to investigate the effects of different combinations of chemical N fertilizer applications and animal manure in autumn on both N2O emissions and maize (Zea mays L.) grain yields in northeast China. The treatments, expressed as NxMy (where Nx and My denote the total amounts of chemical fertilizer nitrogen (N) and manure (M) applied in kg N ha(-1) and m(3)Mha(-1), respectively), were N0M0, N230M0, N270M12, N230M15, N320M18 in 2010 and N0M0, N230M0, N200M12, N200M15, N280M18 in 2011. Measurements of the resulting N2O emissions showed that pulse fluxes occurred after each chemical N fertilizer application, but not after manure inputs in autumn or during soil-thawing periods in the following spring. Emission factors for the chemical fertilizer N were on average 1.07% (1.001.10%) and 1.14% (0.491.83%) in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Furthermore, by comparing the nine pairs of fertilization treatments, the relative increase in cumulative nitrous oxide-nitrogen (N2O-N) emissions was found to be proportional to the relative increase in urea application, but independent of the amount of autumn-applied manure. These findings imply that N2O emissions from fertilized agricultural soils in northeast China could be mitigated by supplying manure in the autumn and reducing the total amount of chemical N fertilizer applied in the following year. Although no significant difference in maize grain yield was found among the fertilization treatments, the grain yield-scaled N2O emissions for the treatments with a lower chemical N application (e.g., N230M15 and N200M15 treatments) were significantly lower than those with a higher chemical N application (e.g., N320M18 and N280M18 treatments). Meanwhile, under the condition of the same application amount of chemical fertilizer N, the grain yield-scaled N2O emission decreased with the increase of manure application rate. Thus, the results support the hypothesis that combining reductions in chemical N fertilizer and applying manure in autumn could be an effective strategy for mitigating N2O emissions from N-fertilized soils in northeast China.

AB The seasonal variation of nitrous oxide and methane fluxes and the relative soil indexes such as soil inorganic nitrogen, and soil humidity were studied under typical dryland fields of winter wheatcotton(WC), winter wheat-summer soybean (WS), and winter wheat-summer maize (WM) rotation patterns in central China. And the fluctuation of N2O and CH4 emission fluxes after topdressing nitrogen fertilizer were investigated too. The results showed that--i) The soil N2O emission flux was positively correlated with soil inorganic N content mostly due to application especially under higher temperature and proper soil humidity condition; ii) The typical cropland was a weak net CH4 sink with the average flux of -0.003 similar to -0.025 mg CH4/m(2)/h; and the methane consumption intensity of dryland soils decreased with the increase of soil humidity; iii) Soil N2O emission peak happened within nine days since topdressing and irrigation occurred. Therefore, the mitigation options for N2O should be adopted mainly after N fertilizer is used especially under warmer temperature.

AB Four soil samples from fields of different land use [US (paddy field), China (paddy field) and Belgium (maize and wheat fields)] were incubated as soil suspension (soil:water ratio 1:4) to study the N2O and CHS emission under different soil redox potential conditions. The results show that the N2O emission was regulated within a narrow redox potential range of +120 to +250 mV, due to the balance of N2O production and its further reduction to N-2. Methane emission occurred below a soil specific redox potential point, and the emission rates were inversely related to soil redox potentials. Both linear and exponential relationships between CH4 emission and the soil redox potential were significant. By extrapolating the linear relationship of CH4 emission against soil redox potential, the critical redox potentials for CH4 production were estimated at about -170 (US paddy soil), -150 (Chinese paddy soil), -215 (Belgian maize soil), and -195 mV (Belgian wheat soil), respectively. In addition, the results indicate that a soil with a lower critical redox potential for CH4 production had a higher CH4 production potential. In this study, N2O and CH4 emissions were found to occur at a distinctly different soil redox potential condition. The range of soil redox potential values where both N2O and CH4 emissions were low was different for different soils, but it was situated between +120 and -170 mV. This is a wide redox potential range enabling field management practices to minimize both N2O and CH4 emissions from wetland ecosystems.

AB Purpose Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are some of the most important greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of the 21st century. Vegetated riparian buffers are primarily implemented for their water quality functions in agroecosystems. Their location in agricultural landscapes allows them to intercept and process pollutants from adjacent agricultural land. They recycle organic matter, which increases soil carbon (C), intercept nitrogen (N)-rich runoff from adjacent croplands, and are seasonally anoxic. Thus processes producing environmentally harmful gases including N2O and CH4 are promoted. Against this context, the study quantified atmospheric losses between a cropland and vegetated riparian buffers that serve it. Methods Environmental variables and simultaneous N2O and CH4 emissions were measured for a 6-month period in a replicated plot-scale facility comprising maize (Zea mays L.). A static chamber was used to measure gas emissions. The cropping was served by three vegetated riparian buffers, namely: (i) grass riparian buffer; (ii) willow riparian buffer and; (iii) woodland riparian buffer, which were compared with a no-buffer control. Results The no-buffer control generated the largest cumulative N2O emissions of 18.9 kg ha(- 1) (95% confidence interval: 0.5-63.6) whilst the maize crop upslope generated the largest cumulative CH4 emissions (5.1 +/- 0.88 kg ha(- 1)). Soil N2O and CH4-based global warming potential (GWP) were lower in the willow (1223.5 +/- 362.0 and 134.7 +/- 74.0 kg CO2-eq. ha(- 1) year(- 1), respectively) and woodland (1771.3 +/- 800.5 and 3.4 +/- 35.9 kg CO2-eq. ha(- 1) year(- 1), respectively) riparian buffers. Conclusions Our results suggest that in maize production and where no riparian buffer vegetation is introduced for water quality purposes (no buffer control), atmospheric CH4 and N2O concerns may result.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and net global warming potential (GWP) are variable following crop residue retention in agroecosystems. We measured the SOC content (from 1990 to 2018) and N2O fluxes (from October 2014 to September 2018) in a long-term fertilizer experiment with winter wheat-summer maize rotation (since 1990) in the Guanzhong Plain. The primary aim was to quantify the effects of maize stalk incorporation on N2O emissions, SOC sequestration (SOCSR), and net GWP during the measurement period. We examined two fertilizer management practices, i.e., synthetic fertilizers in both crop seasons (NF) and synthetic fertilizers in both crop seasons with maize stalk incorporation in the winter wheat season (NFS), and an unfertilized control (CK). Annual N2O emissions ranged from 0.11 to 0.27 kg N ha(- 1 ) yr(-1) in CK. Fertilization significantly increased N2O emissions (p < 0.001), with values ranging from 1.65 to 5.65 and 3.08 to 7.85 kg N ha(- 1 ) yr(- 1 ) in NF and NFS, respectively. The emissions from NFS were 27-253% higher than those from NF, with significant differences (p < 0.05) during three out of four experimental years. The SOC contents linearly increased with the experimental year (p < 0.001), giving SOCSRs of 0.13, 0.45 and 0.60 t C ha(- 1 ) yr(- 1 ) in CK, NF and NFS, respectively. The net GWP averaged - 0.38, - 0.36, and 0.01 t CO2 equivalent ha(- 1 )yr(- 1 )in the three treatments, denoting that NFS was a minor greenhouse gas source during the measurement period. This study provided evidence that maize stalk incorporation increased both N2O emissions and SOC sequestration, while the N2O emissions offset the benefit of SOC sequestration. We conclude that maize stalk incorporation does not appear to be an effective approach to decrease net greenhouse gas emissions from the winter wheat-summer maize rotation in the Guanzhong Plain. This issue can probably be resolved by avoiding fertilizer application to wet soil in the winter wheat season and/or returning winter wheat straw in the summer maize season.

AB Globally, acquiring information on region- and crop-specific nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is vital for establishing effective N2O mitigation strategies. Soil cultivated with cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an important source of N2O in agricultural production. However, little is known about the magnitudes and main drivers of soil N2O emissions from cotton fields worldwide. In this meta-analysis, we were the first to synthesize 34 peer-reviewed papers (298 observational datasets) to quantify the magnitudes and controlling factors of area-scaled N2O emissions (N2Oarea), direct N2O emission factors (EFd), and yield-scaled N2O emissions (N2Oyield) from the soils of cotton fields and to explore associated potential mitigation strategies. On average, the N2Oarea from global cotton-planted soils was 2.10 kg N ha(-1), with a mean EFd of 0.92 %, which is comparable to those reported for cereal crops (e.g., maize, 1.02 %) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default value of 1 % for global croplands. The global mean N2Oyield estimated here was 622 g N Mg-1. At the global scale, the variations in all N2O-related indices in the soils of cotton fields were demonstrated to be primarily controlled by climatic conditions (e.g. climate type) and soil properties (e.g., bulk density, pH, C/N or soil texture) rather than by well-recognized management practices (e.g., N fertilization rate). Furthermore, our analysis showed that the application of urease and/or nitrification inhibitors significantly reduced soil N2O emissions while maintaining seed cotton yields. These findings emphasize that cotton production has an obvious climate footprint and provide potential N2O mitigation options for the sustainable intensification of cotton production.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soil were studied during 6 consecutive years on three plots of two real farms. We analyzed a total of 37 agricultural sequences: 20 sequences with crops including wheat, maize, and legumes and 17 fallow sequences with cover crops, volunteers or bare fallow soils. Controlling factors of N2O emissions were disentangled by using three approaches: (i) applying a random forest algorithm then extracting the most important predictors; (ii) analyzing all sequences separately as a function of the rain and soil mineral nitrate (SMN) content in soils; and (iii) experimentally, by watering soils with different SMN contents. The results showed that rainfall (and hence soil moisture) exerted the greatest control over N2O emissions, followed by daily maximum temperature and SMN. Regarding crop sequences, 6-year N2O cumulative emissions rates (g N2O-N ha(-1)) ranked as follows: legumes (967) < maize (1192) < cereals (1375). Lowest cumulative N2O emissions at the Derrier conventional, no-till, farming plot (similar to 6000 kg N ha(-1)) was observed compared to similar to 15000 kg N2O-N ha(-1) measured at the tilled organic farming Chantemerle and Barrie`re plots. Further, cumulative N2O emissions were rather important during fallow periods with or without cover crops. This study thus supports that N2O emissions need to be measured all year round, including both cropping and fallow periods to grasp the full rotation cycles. This long-term study of N2O emissions gathered a large number of data on N2O emissions over a variety of crops and fallow management and helped to initiate a typology of N2O emissions by crop.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increase the ability of plants to obtain nitrogen (N) from the soil, and thus can affect emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), 2 O), a long-lived potent greenhouse gas. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of AMF on N2O 2 O emissions are still poorly understood, particularly in agroecosystems with different forms of N fertilizer inputs. Utilizing a mesocosm experiment in field, we examined the effects of AMF on N2O 2 O emissions via their influence on maize root traits and denitrifying microorganisms under ammonia and nitrate fertilizer input using 15 N isotope tracer. Here we show that the presence of AMF alone or both maize roots and AMF increased maize biomass and their 15 N uptake, root length, root surface area, and root volume, but led to a reduction in N2O 2 O emissions under both N input forms. Random forest model showed that root length and surface area were the most important predictors of N2O 2 O emissions. Additionally, the presence of AMF reduced the (nirK nir K + nirS)/nosZ S)/ nos Z ratio by increasing the relative abundance of nirS-Bradyrhizobium S- Bradyrhizobium and Rubrivivax with ammonia input, but reducing nosZ-Azospirillum, Z- Azospirillum , Cupriavidus and Rhodopseudomonas under both fertilizer input. Further, N2O 2 O emissions were significantly and positively correlated with the nos Z-type Azospirillum, , Cupriavidus and Rhodopseudomonas, , but negatively correlated with the nir S-type Bradyrhizobium and Rubrivivax. . These results indicate that AMF reduce N2O 2 O emissions by increasing root length to explore N nutrients and altering the community composition of denitrifiers, suggesting that effective management of N fertilizer forms interacting with the rhizosphere microbiome may help mitigate N2O 2 O emissions under future N input scenarios.

AB To evaluate long-term effects of biochar addition and straw return (SR) on N2O fluxes in wheat-maize rotation system, a 2-year field experiment following a 7-year biochar addition and SR was investigated in an intensively managed agricultural soil in the North China Plain (NCP). Four treatments were included: 1) no biochar addition (CK); 2) biochar treatment with 4.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (C1); 3) biochar treatment with 9.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (C2); and 4) all the wheat/maize straw return (SR). The results showed the annual cumulative N2O emissions from C1 treatment were increased by 15.9-16.5%, while C2 treatment suppressed the annual cumulative N2O emissions by 22.8-26.3%. In comparison, straw return suppressed N2O emissions by 13.4-43.6% in the wheat season but increased N2O emissions remarkably by 45.3-53.9% in the maize season. Biochar addition enhanced the copies of AOA, AOB, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes, while straw return decreased the copies of AOB, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes at the high N2O emission period in the maize season. The production of N2O in the maize season was mainly driven by the AOB and nosZ genes, and by AOB gene in the wheat season. These results suggest that application of 9.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1) biochar is a more optimum agricultural strategy for reducing N2O emission in the wheat-maize system.

AB Balancing food security with fertilizer-driven climate impacts remains critical in intensive agriculture. While organic-inorganic substitution enhances soil fertility, its effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions remain uncertain. This study evaluated N2O/NO emissions, crop yields, and agronomic parameters in a subtropical wheat-maize rotation under four fertilization regimes: inorganic-only (NPK), manure-only (OM), and partial substitution with crop residues (CRNPK, 15%) or manure (OMNPK, 30%), all applied at 280 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Emissions aligned with the dual Arrhenius-Michaelis-Menten kinetics and revised "hole-in-the-pipe" model. Annual direct emission factors (EFd) for N2O and NO were 1.01% and 0.11%, respectively, with combined emissions (1.12%) exponentially correlated to soil nitrogen surplus (p < 0.01). CRNPK and OMNPK reduced annual N2O+NO emissions by 15-154% and enhanced NUE by 10-45% compared with OM, though OMNPK emitted 1.7-2.0 times more N2O/NO than CRNPK. Sole OM underperformed in yield, while partial substitution-particularly with crop residues-optimized productivity while minimizing environmental risks. By integrating emission modeling and agronomic performance, this study establishes CRNPK as a novel strategy for subtropical cereal systems, reconciling high yields with low greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Biochar application is considered an effective method of reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in soil. However, the mechanism and temporal effect of different doses of biochar on N2O emissions is still obscure. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment to test the effects of different input amounts and frequencies of biochar on soil N2O emissions in North China. Biochar was applied in six different treatments in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system: applications of 0 t/ha biochar (C0), 2.25 t/ha biochar (C1), 4.5 t/ha biochar (C2), 9 t/ha biochar (C3), and 13.5 t/ha biochar (C4) each year, and a single application of 13.5 t/ha biochar (CS) in the first year. The results showed that biochar could inhibit N2O emissions, reaching 20.6% to 60.1% in the wheat season and 18.1% to 39.4% in the maize season. The inhibitory effect of biochar on soil N2O emissions was dependent on amount and time. C3 had the best results in the wheat season, although its inhibitory effect in the maize season was not as good relative to C4 due to the lower biochar application. In addition, CS significantly reduced (27.7%) the cumulative N2O emissions in the first year, although the inhibitory effect disappeared in the second year. Biochar increased the nosZ gene copy numbers and promoted a reduction of N2O in the soil via the denitrification process. In conclusion, the inhibition of N2O emissions during denitrification is an important factor for reducing soil N2O emissions by biochar, and the inhibition of biochar is influenced by the input amount and time.

AB Agricultural efforts to end hunger in Africa are hampered by low fertilizer-use-efficiency exposing applied nutrients to losses. This constitutes economic losses and environmental concerns related to leaching and greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of NH4NO3 (0, 60 and 120 kg N ha(-1)) on N uptake, N-leaching and indirect N2O emissions were studied during three maize (Zea mays L.) cropping seasons on clay (Chromic luvisol) and sandy loam (Haplic lixisol) soils in Zimbabwe. Leaching was measured using lysimeters, while indirect N2O emissions were calculated from leached N using the emission factor methodology. Results showed accelerated N-leaching (3-26 kg ha(-1) season(-1)) and N-uptake (10-92 kg ha(-1)) with N input. Leached N in groundwater had potential to produce emission increments of 0-94 g N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1) on clay soil, and 5-133 g N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1) on sandy loam soil following the application of NH4NO3. In view of this short-term response intensive cropping using relatively high N rate may be more appropriate for maize in areas whose soils and climatic conditions are similar to those investigated in this study, compared with using lower N rates or no N over relatively larger areas to attain a targeted food security level.

AB Straw return enhances soil quality and cropland sustainability but increases risks of inducing larger nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to the simultaneous input of carbon and nitrogen (N). However, the response of N2O emissions to straw remains controversial, depending on the management-driven dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC), especially its availability. Here, two fields with the same SOC quantity but distinct availability (HCA and LCA, i.e., high vs. low lability) were established with a factorial design of fertilization and straw, to track the straw decomposition, N2O fluxes, available substrates, and N-cycling microbes. Furthermore, a meta-analysis was integrated with the field experiments to decipher how SOC availability regulates N2O emissions responding to straw returning. Meta-analysis revealed that SOC availability mediates the effect of straw return on N2O emissions from maize agroecosystems, with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) identified as the primary regulator of response direction and magnitude, and exhibits a negative correlation with N2O emission response. Consistently, our field experiments showed that straw incorporation combined with fertilization significantly reduced N2O emissions by 22 % in HCA soils but increased emissions by 55 % in LCA soils. Straw incorporation into HCA facilitated bacterial growth while reducing AOB abundance and ammonium supply, suggesting restricted nitrification due to promotion of N immobilization, which ultimately suppressed N2O emissions. Conversely, straw in LCA soils exhibited a faster decomposition rate and stimulated denitrifiers (nirS and nirK) metabolism by increasing DOC concentration and biodegradability, leading to increased N2O emissions. Consequently, the fertilizer-induced N2O emission factor decreased from 1.53 % to 1.11 % by straw for HCA, while increased from 0.67 % to 1.19 % for LCA. Overall, these findings highlight that SOC availability determines the direction and magnitude of straw's impact on N2O emissions, which should be fully considered into sustainable straw management strategies to balance SOC improvement against climate change.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most important greenhouse gas produced by agricultural soils and is a byproduct of microbial nitrification and denitrification processes. The N2O emission rates depend on soil, climatic and management factors. The objectives of this study were i) to evaluate N2O emissions during a barley crop period and its subsequent barley-maize interperiod, under two management systems, and ii) to relate the N2O flux rates with soil mineral N content, waterfilled pore space (WFPS) and soil temperature. These periods are part of three-year crop sequence (barley - maize - soybean) of a long-term experiment under two management systems, ecological intensification (EI) and farmer current practices (FP). For the analyzed period, the EI system included a cover crop after barley and higher N rates, with split application, compared to FP. N2O emissions were monitored weekly using a static chambers method. Simultaneously, the mineral N content (NO3-N and NH4+-N), WFPS and soil temperature at 10 cm depth were determined. The flux of N2O-N ranged from 6 to 61 mu g of N2O-N m2 h-1 during the barley crop and between 1.5 and 47 mu g of N2O-N m2 h-1 during the barley-maize interperiod, without significant differences between management systems. N2O emissions were controlled by soil temperature and %WFPS according to a multiple regression analysis. NH4+-N and NO3-N soil content did not enter into any model as a regulator of N2O flux. During the barley period there was a significant effect of the WFPS x soil temperature interaction since N2O emissions increased with soil temperature only at WFPS > 40 %. During the barley-maize interperiod, there were significant positive effects of WFPS and temperature on N2O emissions with no significant WFPS x temperature interaction. The cumulative emissions of N2O-N were not different between management systems during the barley crop (IE=646 and FP=757 g N2O-N ha-1) or during barley-maize interperiod (IE=816 and FP=754 g N2O-N ha-1). Throughout the study period, the combination of management practices in EI increased barley yield and did not increase N2O emissions with respect to FP, despite higher N rates and the inclusion of cover crop in EI. The intensification of crops does not necessarily increase N2O emissions from agricultural soils as long as the crops are conducted with appropriate management practices.

AB Pig slurry (PS) is a valuable nitrogen (N) source for agricultural crops but the simultaneous supply of readily decomposable carbon and mineral N can result in large soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Our objective was to determine the individual and combined effects of split PS application and addition of a nitrification inhibitor (dicyandiamide, DCD) on N2O emissions and soil mineral N concentration in southern Brazil. Soil N2O fluxes were measured from November 2010 to November 2011 from a maize (Zea maysL.)-wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) sequence under various fertilizer treatments: no-N control, PS applied in a single pre-plant dose with or without DCD, PS split-applied with or without DCD, and urea split-applied. Cumulative N2O emissions increased linearly (R-2=0.73) with increasing soil nitrate (NO3-) exposure, indicating that management practices aimed at reducing soil NO3- concentrations can decrease soil N2O emissions. In total for the two crops, splitting PS reduced N2O emission factors (EF) by 33%, whereas the addition of DCD reduced EF by 60 and 41% when PS was applied in single and split doses, respectively. However, splitting PS or adding DCD failed to reduce N2O losses more than a single pre-plant PS application in maize where background soil NO3- concentrations were large. The addition of DCD to PS applied as a single pre-plant dose resulted in the largest reduction in soil N2O emissions, whereas splitting PS with and without DCD resulted in significantly smaller abatements. Consequently, we concluded that adding DCD to PS in a single pre-plant application is a better option than splitting PS applications for reducing soil N2O emissions in no-till cereal cropping systems in southern Brazil.

AB Biochar, a carbon-rich, porous pyrolysis product of organic residues may positively affect plant yield and can, owing to its inherent stability, promote soil carbon sequestration when amended to agricultural soils. Another possible effect of biochar is the reduction in emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). A number of laboratory incubations have shown significantly reduced N2O emissions from soil when mixed with biochar. Emission measurements under field conditions however are more scarce and show weaker or no reductions, or even increases in N2O emissions. One of the hypothesised mechanisms for reduced N2O emissions from soil is owing to the increase in soil pH following the application of alkaline biochar. To test the effect of biochar on N2O emissions in a temperate maize cropping system, we set up a field trial with a 20 t ha(-1) biochar treatment, a limestone treatment adjusted to the same pH as the biochar treatment (pH 6.5), and a control treatment without any addition (pH 6.1). An automated static chamber system measured N2O emissions for each replicate plot (n = 3) every 3.6 h over the course of 8 months. The field was conventionally fertilised at a rate of 160 kgNha(-1) in three applications of 40, 80 and 40 kgNha(-1) as ammonium nitrate.
   Cumulative N2O emissions were 52% smaller in the biochar compared to the control treatment. However, the effect of the treatments overall was not statistically significant (p = 0.27) because of the large variability in the data set. Limed soils emitted similar mean cumulative amounts of N2O as the control. There is no evidence that reduced N2O emissions with biochar relative to the control is solely caused by a higher soil pH.

AB Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring crop productivity simultaneously is a major challenge that demands the balance of the amounts of nitrogen (N) and straw (S) applied to agricultural soil. This study seeks to determine whether higher grain yields and lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions could be realized concomitantly by optimizing synthetic N rates and straw returning. The effect of fertilizer N rates and straw application on the inter-annual yield-scaled N2O emission variations was measured over a three-year period (2011-2014) in a maize-wheat cropping system on the North China Plain (NCP). Yield scaled N2O emissions were expressed as g N2O-N per Mg grain. Six treatments with three synthetic N levels (zero N [N-0], optimized N [N-opt] and conventional N [N-con]) and two straw management practices (straw removal [i.e., N-0, N-opt and N-con] and straw return [i.e., N-0 +S,N-opt +S and N-con + S]) were used. Optimized N (N-opt, N-opt + S) refers to the use of approximately 50% of the fertilizer N that is used in conventional farming practices (N-con, N-con +S), with no significant decrease in grain yields (P>0.05). Optimized N reduced cumulative N2O emissions by 18-37%, which in turn significantly decreased yield scaled N2O emissions by 38-42% (P < 0.05). The effects of fertilizer N rates and grain yields on cumulative N2O emissions are described by linear and exponential models, respectively. Straw return had a positive effect on mean yield-scaled N2O emissions both in the maize season and annually. Yield-scaled N2O emissions are constructive considering the trade-off between grain yield and N2O emission mitigation from intensive crop production. Optimized fertilizer N rate combined with straw return reduced yield scaled N2O emissions significantly in maize-wheat rotations. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Although numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of no-tillage on carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural systems, there is still no consensus on the balance between the potential of C sequestration and nitrous oxide (N2O) or nitric oxide (NO) emissions. A no-tillage field experiment in the North China Plain was established in 2006 and the influence of no-tillage on N2O and NO emissions was monitored under an annual wheat-maize cropping system. The study included four treatments: no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) soils amended with N fertilizer at a rate of 225 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and 195 kg N ha(-1) for maize (NTN and CTN) and without N fertilizer (NT0 and CT0). Three years of no-tillage significantly (p < 0.05) increased soil organic C (SOC) content by 12.2% in the 0-5 cm soil layer, possibly due to the surface aggregation of organic C derived from crop roots and exudates, but did not alter SOC pool in the 0-30 an profile. Annual N2O emissions in the NT0 and CT0 treatments were 0.53 and 0.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively, and were significantly (p < 0.05) increased to 0.96 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in CTN and to 1.23 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in NTN. Remarkable differences in N20 emissions between CTN and NTN were observed during the maize growing season. In contrast, NO emissions were not affected by the tillage regimes regardless of N fertilization. The mean ratios of NO/N2O fluxes in N-unfertilized plots were 0.26-0.29 and 1.79-2.11 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, indicating that both NO and N2O were primarily derived from denitrification during the maize growing season and from nitrification under wheat cultivation. Under N-fertilized plots, the ratios increased to 1.44-2.02 and 5.00-6.03 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, with significantly (p < 0.05) lower values in NTN plots than in CTN plots. The N2O emission factors for N applied in the wheat-maize rotation system were 0.16% and 0.09% for NTN and CTN, respectively, which was far lower than the IPCC Tier 1 default value (1.0%), primarily due to the absence of irrigation after fertilization in maize season and low temperature in wheat season. The results suggest that the 3-year no-tillage regime with residue removal did not substantially increase C storage in the 0-30 cm profile, but stimulated N2O emissions primarily by increasing denitrification.

AB Optimizing management practices is essential to guarantee crop yield and reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the sustainable agricultural production under climate change. The objectives of this study were to i) calibrate and evaluate the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model using the measurements of maize yield, nitrogen (N) uptake, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil inorganic N and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a 5-year maize field experiment in Northeast China (NEC) and ii) simulate the impacts of climate change on maize yield and N2O emissions and explore adaptation strategies based on DNDC modelling. For N-fertilized treatments (farmers' practice, FP-N; current optimized management, OPT-N), the DNDC model overall showed "good" performance in simulating maize yield, aboveground biomass, N uptake and soil inorganic N based on the average statistical values. The model also performed well in simulating soil moisture, soil temperature and N2O emissions. For N-unfertilized treatments, however, the DNDC model overestimated crop yield and N uptake mainly due to the overestimation of crop growth under low-temperature stress conditions, and the underestimation of soil inor-ganic N resulted from the underestimated N mineralization and N availability from the dissolved inorganic N pools under continuous N deficiency. The DNDC model showed that compared to the baseline scenario, future climate change would improve the maize yield (1.4-8.8%) while increasing the N2O emissions (37.6-83.4%) without adaptation measures in NEC. Compared to OPT-N management, solely adjusting N fertilization rate (200-220 kg N ha-1) would concurrently increase maize yield (5.0-8.7%) and N2O emissions (0.9-18.6%), while the adoption of optimized planting dates (April 27th to May 18th), new cultivars (with thermal degree days ranging from 2550 to 2700 degrees C), and the implementation of no-tillage and maize-soybean rotation would increase the maize yield by 1.8-8.9% and reduce the N2O emissions by 0.7-26.5% under future climate change scenarios. This study provided insights into the adaptive management strategies for the sustainable maize production under climate change in NEC.

AB In a 1-year study, quantification of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was made from a flood-irrigated cotton field fertilized with urea at 100kg N ha(-1) a(-1). Measurements were made during the cotton-growing season (May-November) and the fallow period (December-April). Of the total 95 sampling dates, 77 showed positive N2O fluxes (range, 0.1 to 33.3g N ha(-1) d(-1)), whereas negative fluxes (i.e., N2O sink activity) were recorded on 18 occasions (range, -0.1 to -2.2g N ha(-1) stop d(-1)). Nitrous oxide sink activity was more frequently observed during the growing season (15 out of 57 sampling dates) as compared to the fallow period (3 out of 38 sampling dates). During the growing season, contribution of N2O to the denitrification gaseous N products was much less (average, 4%) as compared to that during the fallow period (average, 21%). Nitrous oxide emission integrated over the 6-month growing period amounted 324g N ha(-1), whereas the corresponding figure for the 6-month fallow period was 648g N ha(-1). Subtracting the N2O sink activity (30.3g N ha(-1) and 3.8g N ha(-1) during the growing season and fallow period, respectively), the net N2O emission amounted 938g N ha(-1) a(-1). Results suggested that high soil moisture and temperature prevailing under flood-irrigated cotton in the Central Punjab region of Pakistan though favor high denitrification rates, but are also conducive to N2O reduction thus leading to relatively low N2O emission.

AB The application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers to agricultural soils is a primary source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to the atmosphere. The default emission factor (EF) suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is 1.0% of fertilizers-N applied to agricultural soils. This EF has been found to vary significantly in time and space and country specific EF is needed to improve the reliability of greenhouse gas inventory. In this study, direct N2O emission factor in a silt loam soil cultivated with maize was investigated using the static chamber method. Daily N2O fluxes from three treatments: control (T1), and two N application rates of 97 (T2) and 155 (T3) kg N ha(-1) were studied in the field experiments. Results indicated that the average N2O fluxes (average +/- S.E.) in T1, T2 and T3 treatments for three cropping cycles were 0.54 +/- 0.26, 0.81 +/- 0.26 and 0.98 +/- 0.27 mg N2O m(-2) day(-1), respectively. N2O emissions increased sharply after 5-7 days of N fertilization application, with the highest value corresponding to 18-32% of total N2O emissions. The average EFs for three crops were 0.0082 +/- 0.0022 kg N2O-Nkg(-1) N for T2 (0.82% of N applied) and 0.0059 +/- 0.0014 kgN(2)O-Nkg(-1) N for T3 (0.59% of N applied). It was found that the total N2O emissions as well as maize yields varied between wet and dry seasons. It is thus recommended that atleast both wet and dry croppings are included when country specifics EFs are developed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the RZWQM2 (Root Zone Water Quality Model) was used to simulate the responses of N2O emissions to different Nitrogen application rates on an irrigated corn field from 2003 to 2006, in eastern Colorado, USA. Four different algorithms from the literature were coupled with RZWQM2 and compared for simulating N2O emissions during nitrification and denitrification processes. The RZWQM2 was first calibrated for corn yield, N uptake, soil water (0-10 cm) and soil Nitrate-N content (0-180 cm) and the simulated daily nitrification and denitrification rates were used to calculate N2O emission using the algorithms from DAYCENT, NOE (Nitrous Oxide Emissions), WNMM (Water and Nitrogen Management Model), and FASSET models. The best N2O emission was simulated when the fraction of N2O release from nitrification was modified by water filled pore space (WFPS) as in the NOE model and the fraction N2O release from denitrification was adopted from the DAYCENT model.

AB Farmers, food supply companies, and policymakers need practical yet scientifically robust methods to quantify how improved nitrogen (N) fertilizer management can reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. To meet this need, we developed an empirical model based on published field data for predicting N2O emission from rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) fields managed with inorganic N fertilizer in the United States and Canada. Nitrous oxide emissions ranged widely on an area basis (0.03-32.9 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and a yield-scaled basis (0.006-4.8 kg N Mg-1 grain yr-1). We evaluated multiple modeling approaches and variables using three metrics of model fit (Akaike information criteria corrected for small sample sizes [AICc], RMSE, and R-2). Ourmodel explains 32.8% of the total observed variation and 50% of observed site-level variation. Soil clay content was very important for predicting N2O emission and predicting the change in N2O emission due to a change in N balance, with the addition of a clay fixed effect explaining 37% of site-level variation. Sites with higher clay content showed greater reductions in N2O emission for a given reduction in N balance. Therefore, high-clay sites are particularly important targets for reducing N2O emissions. Our linear mixed model is more suitable for predicting the effect of improved N management on N2O emission in maize fields than other published models because it (a) requires only input data readily available on working farms, (b) is derived from field observations, (c) correctly represents differences among sites using a mixedmodeling approach, and (d) includes soil texture because it strongly influences N2O emissions.

AB In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), few studies have quantified greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions following application of soil amendments, for development of accurate national GHG inventories. Therefore, this study quantified soil GHG emissions using static chambers for two maize cropping seasons (one full year) of four different soil amendments in the central highlands of Kenya. The four treatments were (i) animal manure, (ii) inorganic fertilizer, (iii) combined animal manure and inorganic fertilizer, and (iv) a no-N control (no amendment) laid out in a randomized complete block design. Cumulative annual soil fluxes (February 2017 to February 2018) ranged from -1.03 +/- 0.19 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1)from the manure inorganic fertilizer treatment to -0.09 +/- 0.03 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1)from the manure treatment, 1,391 +/- 74 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)from the control treatment to 3,574 +/- 113 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)from the manure treatment, and 0.13 +/- 0.08 to 1.22 +/- 0.12 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)in the control and manure treatments, respectively. Animal manure amendment produced the highest cumulative CO(2)emissions (P < 0.001), N2O emissions (P < 0.001), and maize yields (P = 0.002) but the lowest N2O yield-scaled emission (YSE) (0.5 g N2O-N kg(-1)grain yield). Manure combined with inorganic fertilizer had the highest cumulative CH(4)uptake (P < 0.001) and N2O YSE (2.2 g N2O-N kg(-1)grain yield). Our results indicate that while the use of animal manure may increase total GHG emissions, the concurrent increase in maize yields results in reduced yield-scaled GHG emissions.

AB To evaluate the response of soil respiration and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission to soil moisture, temperature and nitrogen fertilization, and to estimate the contribution of soil and rhizosphere to total soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and N2O emissions, a field experiment was conducted in the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in the northeast of China. The experiment included four treatments: bare soil fertilized with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (CK), and maize-cropped soils amended with 0 (N0), 150 (N150), and 250 (N250) kg N ha-1 yr-1. The cumulative soil CO2 emission in the CK, N0, N150, and N250 treatments was estimated to be 698, 863, 962, and 854 g CO2 C m-2, respectively. The seasonal soil CO2 fluxes were significantly affected by soil temperature, with a Q10 value between 1.99 and 2.47. Analysis of the stepwise regression indicated that the CO2 flux can be quantitatively described by a linear combination of soil moisture content and soil temperature 5 cm below ground. Approximately 70, 58, 60, and 44% of the variability in CO2 flux can be explained by these two parameters, in CK, N0, N150, and N250, respectively. Nitrogen fertilization with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 increased CO2 fluxes by 14.5% compared with soils fertilized with 0 kg N ha-1 yr-1. However, in the soil fertilized with 250 kg N ha-1 yr-1, high N fertilization suppressed soil respiration. There was an exponential relationship between soil temperature 5 cm below ground and N2O flux, with a Q10 value of 1.30-2.91. Mean cumulative soil N2O emissions during the maize-growing season in the CK, N0, N150, and N250 treatments were estimated to be 86, 44, 200, and 484 mg N2O-N m-2, respectively. In contrast to the maize planting, soil fertilized with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and with 250 kg N ha-1 yr-1 increased N2O fluxes by 354 and 1000%, compared with soils fertilized with 0 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Soil respiration and N2O fluxes measurement using the root-exclusion technique indicated that the rhizosphere of the maize could be the dominant habitat of soil respiration and N2O formation.

AB Various strategies, particularly those that affect nitrogen (N)-related processes at the soil plant interface, have been investigated to enhance N-agronomic efficiency (AE) and reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils fertilized with urea, the main N source employed in Brazilian agriculture. This study aimed to evaluate the AE and the N2O emissions from soils cultivated with maize in soybean-maize succession following treatment with different mitigation approaches in Southern Amazon. An experiment of randomized block design was performed involving seven treatments in which maize was cultivated in soil: (T1) under control conditions; (T2) inoculated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB); (T3) fertilized with urea; (T4) inoculated with NFB and fertilized with urea; (T5) fertilized with urea containing the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD); (T6) fertilized with urea containing the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT); (T7) fertilized with urea containing a combination of DCD and NBPT. The highest N2O fluxes (300 mu g N2O-N m-2 h-1) were recorded for T3 and T4 around 12-14 days after top dressing fertilization with urea. Application of DCD-containing urea (T5 and, to a lesser extent, T7) was effective in reducing N2O emissions. Emission factors were below of 1% for all treatments, with the highest values (<= 0.42%) recorded for T3, T4 and T6. Fertilization with urea containing DCD alone or in combination with NBPT (T5 and T7) improved the grain yield, the AE, the yield-scaled N2O and reduced emission factors values by around 75% to the level registered for T3. Use of nitrification inhibitors represents an alternative for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions during the off-season maize cropping cycle in Southern Amazon.

AB Fertilization with biogas residues from the digestion of energy crops is of growing importance. Digestate from silage maize (Zea mays L.) is a new fertilizer with a high potential for ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different maize fertilization systems [180 kg N ha(-1) in form of calcium nitrate (MIN), biogas digestate from maize (DIG) and biogas digestate from maize mixed with the nitrification inhibitor Piadin (DIG + NI)] on the emission of NH3 and N2O from a sandy soil and to assess the total greenhouse gas emission of these fertilization systems. The study is based on a randomized field plot experiment in central Germany and an experimental period of a full year. Annual N2O-N emission was generally low [0.21 (MIN) to 0.37 (DIG) kg N ha(-1)] without differences between treatments. The application of Piadin reduced N2O emissions by 37 and 62 % during the weeks following digestate application but the annual N2O emission was not affected by the fertilization treatment. NH3 emission was only significant for treatments fertilized with digestate. It was not affected by Piadin and accounted for 27 % (+NI) and 29 % of the applied ammonium. Total greenhouse gas emission was dominated by NH3 losses (reducing the fertilizer value and inducing indirect N2O emissions) for the treatments fertilized with maize digestate. The most important greenhouse gas emission source of the MIN treatment were emissions from fertilizer production. Our results show the high potential of digestate from maize as a new source of NH3 emission. Mitigation measures are essential to save the value of this new fertilizer type and to reduce atmospheric and environmental pollution by direct emission of NH3 and indirect emission of greenhouse gases.

AB Few studies have quantified soil greenhouse gas (GHG) - CH4, CO2 N2O - annual fluxes directly from smallholder maize cropping systems under different soil fertility management technologies in Sub Saharan Africa. We quantified soil GHG annual fluxes from smallholder maize cropping systems under four different soil fertility management technologies in the Central Highlands of Kenya. We regularly sampled GHG from 2nd March 2018 to 1st March 2019 (1 year) in three maize farms using a static chamber technique. The fertility management technologies were: inorganic fertilizer, animal manure, animal manure combined with inorganic fertilizer, and a Control (No external input). The experimental design was a randomized complete block design replicated thrice. Cumulative annual soil fluxes ranged from -2.40 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the control treatment to -1.62 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the manure combined with inorganic fertilizer treatment, 4810 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the control treatment to 6576 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the inorganic fertilizer treatment, and 0.21 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) from the control treatment to 0.38 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) from the inorganic fertilizer treatment for CH4, CO2, and N2O fluxes, respectively. Fertilizer treatment produced the highest CO2 emissions (p < 0.001), N2O emissions (P < 0.001), and yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSE), (0.028 g N2O-N kg(-1) grain yield). A combination of manure and inorganic fertilizer produced the highest CH4 fluxes (p = 0.035) across treatments. We concluded that a judicious combination of organic resources (animal manure) and inorganic resources (fertilizer) has the potential to enhance food security while mitigating soil greenhouse gas emissions in SSA.

AB Sludge derived from cow manure anaerobically digested to produce biogas (methane; CH4) was applied to maize (Zea mays L.) cultivated in a nutrient-low, alkaline, saline soil with electrolytic conductivity 9.4 dS m(-1) and pH 9.3. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission increased 3.1 times when sludge was applied to soil, 1.6 times when cultivated with maize and 3.5 times in sludge-amended maize cultivated soil compared to the unamended uncultivated soil (1.51 mg C kg(-1) soil day(-1)). Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from unamended soil was -0.0004 mu g nitrogen (N) kg(-1) soil day(-1) and similar from soil cultivated with maize (0.27 mu g N kg(-1) soil day(-1)). Application of sludge increased the N2O emission to 4.59 mu g N kg(-1) soil day(-1), but cultivating this soil reduced it to 2.42 mu g N kg(-1) soil day(-1). It was found that application of anaerobic digested cow manure stimulated maize development in an alkaline saline soil and increased emissions of CO2 and N2O.

TI Nitrous oxide fluxes from manure-amended soil under maize

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by agricultural soils are influenced by farming practices. The application of manure to cultivated land modifies soil microbial activity by supplying additional quantities of C and N and changing soil physical and chemical properties. Nitrous oxide fluxes at the surface of a soil under maize (Zea mays L.) amended with dairy cattle manure were measured from April to October 1993 using closed chambers. The manure application rates were 0, 56, and 112 Mg ha(-1) corresponding to 0, 170, and 339 kg ha(-1) of total N, respectively. Nitrate and NH4+ were measured in soil samples obtained at the same time that gas flux measurements were made. Nitrous oxide concentrations in the soil profile were quantified by sampling soil air at depths of 5 and 15 cm using stationary air probes. On the manured plots 67% of the total N2O emitted during the growing season occurred during the first 7 wk following manure application. Fluxes of N2O occurred in episodes with maxims that ranged from 0.070 mg m(-2) h(-1) on the soil without manure amendment to 0.171 and 0.494 mg m(-2) h(-1) on sons that had received the low and high rates of manure, respectively. These high fluxes coincided with periods when NO3-N levels and soil water contents were relatively high. Fluxes were highest the first day after manure application and returned to near preapplication levels 7 d later. This episode was followed by short-lived peaks of N2O flux that usually followed periods of rain. The absence of a strong correlation between N2O concentration in the soil profile and N2O flux at the soil surface suggested that high soil water content restricted gaseous diffusion in the soil and/or that a variable part of the N2O produced via denitrification was reduced to N-2. The accumulated N2O-N emissions at the soil surface of the manured plots over the snow-free season amounted to 1% of the manure N that was potentially mineralizable during the experiment.

AB Nitrification inhibitors can effectively decrease nitrification rates and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission while increasing crop yield under certain conditions. However, there is no information available on the effects of nitrification inhibitors and tillage practices on N2O emissions from maize cropping in Iran. To study how tillage practices and nitrapyrin (a nitrification inhibitor) affect N2O emission, a split factorial experiment using a completely randomized block design with three replications was carried out in Northeast Iran, which has a cold semiarid climate. Two main plots were created with conventional tillage and minimum tillage levels, and two nitrogen (N) fertilizer (urea) management systems (with and without nitrapyrin application) were created as subplots. Tillage level did not have any significant effect on soil ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3) concentrations, cumulative amount and yield-scaled N2O emission, and aboveground biomass of maize, whereas nitrapyrin application showed significant effect. Nitrapyrin application significantly reduced the cumulative amount of N2O emission by 41% and 32% in conventional tillage and minimum tillage practices, respectively. A reduction in soil NO3 concentration by nitrapyrin was also observed. The average yield-scaled N2O emission was 13.6 g N2O-N kg(-1) N uptake in both tillage systems without nitrapyrin application and was significantly reduced to 7.9 and 8.2 g N2O-N kg(-1) N uptake upon the application of nitrapyrin in minimum tillage and conventional tillage practices, respectively. Additionally, nitrapyrin application increased maize biomass yield by 4% and 13% in the minimum tillage and conventional tillage systems, respectively. Our results indicate that nitrapyrin has a potential role in reducing N2O emission from agricultural systems where urea fertilizers are broadcasted, which is common in Iran due to the practice of traditional farming.

AB A systematic understanding of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and grain yield in winter wheat-summer maize rotation, one of the most important cereal cropping systems in China, is still lacking. The primary aim of this study was to quantify the N2O emissions and grain yield, as well as responses to mitigation strategies, in this intensively managed agroecosystem. We conducted a pairwise meta-analysis by compiling a comprehensive dataset of annual N2O emissions (n = 530) and grain yields (n = 352) from peer reviewed publications. The N2O emissions increased with nitrogen (N) fertilizer input rates following a linear model (r(2) = 0.295, p < 0.001), giving a specific emission coefficient and background emission of 0.71% and 0.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The grain yields responded to the N input rates following a linear-plateau model (r(2) = 0.478, p < 0.001), giving an optimal N input rate and maximum grain yield of 405 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 15.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The meta-analyses revealed that reducing N fertilizers (approximately 50% of the full N input), water-saving irrigation, reduced or no tillage, and applying enhanced efficiency fertilizers significantly decreased N2O emissions (range: -45% to -9%) and increased or did not impact grain yields (range: -1% to -3%). We recommend that reducing agricultural inputs (i.e., N fertilizers, irrigation, and tillage) is a feasible N2O mitigation strategy in the intensively managed winter wheat-summer maize rotation that can be employed without additional environmental risks.

AB This investigation examines nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from soil with simultaneous amendments of anaerobic digestates and biochar. The main source of anthropogenic emissions of N2O is agriculture and in particular, manure and slurry application to fields. Anaerobic digestates are increasingly used as a fertiliser and interest is growing in their potential as sources of N2O via nitrification and denitrification. Biochar is a stable product of pyrolysis and may affect soil properties such as cation exchange capacity and water holding capacity. Whilst work has been conducted on the effects of biochar amendment on N2O emissions in soils fertilised with mineral fertilisers and raw animal manures, little work to date has focused on the effects of biochar on nitrogen transformations within soil amended with anaerobic digestates. The aim of the current investigation was to quantify the effects of biochar application on ammonification, nitrification and N2O fluxes within soil amended with three anaerobic digestates derived from different feedstocks. A factorial experiment was undertaken in which a sandy loam soil (Dunnington Heath series) was either left untreated, or amended with three different anaerobic digestates and one of three biochar treatments; 0%, 1% or 3%. Nitrous oxide emissions were greatest from soil amended with anaerobic digestate originating from a maize feedstock. Biochar amendment reduced N2O emissions from all treatments, with the greatest effect observed in treatments with maximum emissions. The degree of N2O production and efficacy of biochar amelioration of gas emissions is discussed in context of soil microbial biomass and soil available carbon. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB To evaluate the effects of application of biochar and straw return for consecutive years on N2O emissions and crop yields in North China, a three-year field experiment of applying biochar and straw following a ten-year application was conducted in a wheat-maize rotation system. Four treatments were set up, including F (NPK fertilizer only); FB (NPK fertilizer + 9.0 t<middle dot>ha(-1) biochar); FS (NPK fertilizer + straw); and FSB ((NPK fertilizer + 9.0 t<middle dot>ha(-1) biochar combined with straw). The results showed that compared with the F treatment, the FB treatment significantly reduced soil N2O emissions by 20.2%, while the FS and FSB treatments increased it by 23.7% and 41.4%, respectively. The FB treatment reduced soil N2O emissions by 15.1% in the wheat season and 23.2% in the maize season, respectively. The FS and FSB treatments increased the N2O emissions by 20.7% and 36.7% in the wheat season, respectively, and by 25.5% and 44.2% in the maize season, respectively. In the wheat season, the soil water content (SWC), NO3--N content and pH were the main influencing factors of the soil N2O emissions. In the maize season, SWC and NO3--N content were the main influencing factors. In addition, the FB, FS and FSB treatments increased the crop yield by 4.99%, 8.40% and 10.25% compared with the F treatment, respectively. In conclusion, consecutive application of biochar can significantly reduce N2O emissions and improve crop yield. Although FS and FSB treatments can also improve the crop yield, they are not beneficial to suppressing N2O emissions. Therefore, the successive application of biochar is an effective measure to reduce N2O emissions and maintain crop yield.

AB The IPCC assume a linear relationship between nitrogen (N) application rate and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in inventory reporting, however, a growing number of studies show a nonlinear relationship under specific soil-climatic conditions. In the North China plain, a global hotspot of N2O emissions, covering a land as large as Germany, the correlation between N rate and N2O emissions remains unclear. We have therefore specifically investigated the N2O response to N applications by conducting field experiments with five N rates, and high-frequency measurements of N2O emissions across contrasting climatic years. Our results showed that cumulative and yield-scaled N2O emissions both increased exponentially as N applications were raised above the optimum rate in maize (Zea mays L.). In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) there was a corresponding quadratic increase in N2O emissions with the magnitude of the response in 2012-2013 distinctly larger than that in 2013-2014 owing to the effects of extreme snowfall. Existing empirical models (including the IPCC approach) of the N2O response to N rate have overestimated N2O emissions in the North China plain, even at high N rates. Our study therefore provides a new and robust analysis of the effects of fertilizer rate and climatic conditions on N2O emissions.

AB Enhancement of microbial assimilation of inorganic nitrogen (N) by straw addition is believed to be an effective pathway to improve farmland N cycling. However, the effectiveness of differently pretreated straws on soil N2O emissions and soil N-acquiring enzyme activities remains unclear. In this study, a pot experiment with four treatments (I, no addition, CK; II, respective addition of maize straw, S; III, composted maize straw under no fungi inoculation, SC; and IV, composted maize straw under fungi inoculation, SCPA) at the same quantity of carbon (C) input was conducted under the same amount of inorganic N fertilization. Results showed that the seasonal cumulative N2O emissions following the SCPA treatment were the lowest at 4.03 kg N ha(-1), representing a significant reduction of 19 % compared with the CK treatment. The S and SC treatments had no significant effects on N2O emissions. The decrease of soil N2O emissions following the SCPA treatment was mainly attributed to the increase of microbial N assimilation and the increased abundance of functional genes related to N2O reductase. The SCPA treatment significantly decreased soil alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and increased leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) activity at the basal fertilization, while increased soil ALP and LAP activity, decreased soil N-Acetyl-beta-D-Glucosidase (NAG) activity at harvest. Compared with the CK treatment, the S, SC, and SCPA treatment significantly increased soil beta-glucosidase (beta-GC) activity at harvest. The decrease in the (NAG+LAP)/ALP ratio following the SCPA treatment indicated that the composted maize straw under fungi inoculation alleviated microbial N limitation at harvest. Moreover, PICRUSt analysis also suggested that the SCPA treatment increased the abundance of bacterial genes associated with N assimilation and N2O reduction, whereas the S and SC treatment did not significantly affect the abundance of N2O reduction genes compared with the CK treatment. Our results suggest that the composted maize straw under fungi inoculation would reduce the risk of N2O emissions and effectively mitigate the microbial N limitation in dryland wheat system.

AB The use of anaerobic digestates as fertilizer is proposed as a means to close agricultural nutrient cycles. However, digestates have higher inorganic nitrogen contents than raw manures, which could translate into increased emissions of potent greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). To mitigate these emissions, the addition of biochar with high nutrient absorption capacity is suggested. To quantify the effects of anaerobic digestion and biochar amendment on N2O and CH4 emissions, we conducted a study over 33 months with four different crops (silage maize, winter wheat, winter barley, and forage grass). We measured soil parameters such as mineral nitrogen, moisture, and temperature. The N2O emissions after application of digestates were generally similar to those observed after cattle slurry or mineral fertilizer application. The highest N2O emissions were observed in the first year of the experiment during maize cultivation and were strongly influenced by high soil nitrate concentrations, which were likely linked to enhanced soil organic N mineralization after ley termination. The CH4 emissions were mostly negative. The addition of biochar to co-digested manure before application at an annual rate of 2 t ha  1 had no effect on N2O emissions but led to short-lived CH4 peaks from organic fertilizers directly after spreading. We conclude that digestates do not promote larger N2O emissions than mineral fertilizers or cattle slurry, and that biochar addition to digestates in small application quantities does not reduce N2O emissions but bears the risk of CH4 release.

AB N2O emissions from a maize-wheat rotation field were monitored in the Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station (Fenaqiu County, Henan Province, China) from June 2004 to June 2005. The experiment included four treatments: a bare (crop-absent) soil treated with 150 kg N ha(-1) (WN150) and soils fertilized with 0 (N0), 150 (N 150), and 250 (N250) kg N ha(-1) and cropped with maize or wheat. The bulk of the N2O emissions occurred in pulses following the application of fertilizer N at soil temperatures of 15 degrees C or more. The application of fertilizer N significantly increased the N2O emission, from 636 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the N0 treatment to 4480 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the N250 treatment. However, this increase primarily occurred during the maize growing season. The emission factor of applied fertilizer N as N2O was 1.05-1.34% and 0.24-0.26% during the 105-day maize and 241-day wheat growing seasons, respectively, and was on average 0.61-0.77%. Increasing the rate of fertilizer application increased the emission factor during the maize growing season. The presence of maize appears to increase N2O emission by 45% versus bare soil during the maize growing season. And, N2O emission during the maize season were significantly related to CO, production (R=0.43-0.81, n=30, P < 0.05). N2O emission was greatly affected by soil moisture during the maize growing season and by soil temperature during the wheat growing season. The maximum rates of nitrification occurred when soil moisture was in the range of 45-60% WFPS, with the optimum value being approximately 50%. However, soil moisture influenced N2O emission only when the soil temperature was at the optimum level. It is suggested that reducing the application rate of basal fertilizer N during the maize growing season could decrease N2O emission. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Animal manure application as organic fertilizer does not only sustain agricultural productivity and increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, but also affects soil nitrogen cycling and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, given that the sign and magnitude of manure effects on soil N2O emissions is uncertain, the net climatic impact of manure application in arable land is unknown. Here, we performed a global meta-analysis using field experimental data published in peer-reviewed journals prior to December 2015. In this meta-analysis, we quantified the responses of N2O emissions to manure application relative to synthetic N fertilizer application from individual studies and analyzed manure characteristics, experimental duration, climate, and soil properties as explanatory factors. Manure application significantly increased N2O emissions by an average 32.7% (95% confidence interval: 5.1-58.2%) compared to application of synthetic N fertilizer alone. The significant stimulation of N2O emissions occurred following cattle and poultry manure applications, subsurface manure application, and raw manure application. Furthermore, the significant stimulatory effects on N2O emissions were also observed for warm temperate climate, acid soils (pH < 6.5), and soil texture classes of sandy loam and clay loam. Average direct N2O emission factors (EFs) of 1.87% and 0.24% were estimated for upland soils and rice paddy soils receiving manure application, respectively. Although manure application increased SOC stocks, our study suggested that the benefit of increasing SOC stocks as GHG sinks could be largely offset by stimulation of soil N2O emissions and aggravated by CH4 emissions if, particularly for rice paddy soils, the stimulation of CH4 emissions by manure application was taken into account.

AB The relationship between nitrous oxide (N2O) flux and N availability in agricultural ecosystems is usually assumed to be linear, with the same proportion of nitrogen lost as N2O regardless of input level. We conducted a 3-year, high-resolution N fertilizer response study in southwest Michigan USA to test the hypothesis that N2O fluxes increase mainly in response to N additions that exceed crop N needs. We added urea ammonium nitrate or granular urea at nine levels (0-292 kg N ha(-1)) to four replicate plots of continuous maize. We measured N2O fluxes and available soil N biweekly following fertilization and grain yields at the end of the growing season. From 2001 to 2003 N2O fluxes were moderately low (ca. 20 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1)) at levels of N addition to 101 kg N ha(-1), where grain yields were maximized, after which fluxes more than doubled (to > 50 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1)). This threshold N2O response to N fertilization suggests that agricultural N2O fluxes could be reduced with no or little yield penalty by reducing N fertilizer inputs to levels that just satisfy crop needs.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural activities are a significant contributor to global anthropogenic N2O emissions. Sustainable agriculture practices, including using manure compost to replace nitrogen (N) fertilizers, can reduce chemical fertilizer use and minimize negative impacts on soil health and water quality. However, the direct contributions of manure compost to N2O emissions have not been fully studied. We conducted a field study to distinguish the direct contributions of manure compost, urea, and residual maize roots to N2O emissions in an integrated crop-livestock agricultural system in Shandong Province, China. Using the N-15-labeling technique, we found that the majority (93.3%) of cumulative N2O emissions originated from the soil and other unaccounted sources. Notably, manure compost contributed 1.3%, while current-year urea, residual urea with root exudates, and maize root accounted for 3.4%, 1.9%, and 0.03% of cumulative N2O, respectively. Our results also demonstrated that applying manure compost in combination with urea resulted in lower seed yield-scaled N2O emissions (0.046 g N2O-N kg(-1) seed) compared to applying urea alone, even when the total N input was identical, suggesting the potential of manure compost in a more sustainable agriculture model. The low emission factor of manure compost (0.005%) compared to urea (0.019%) supports this potential, indicating the slow-release nature of manure may mitigate N2O while maintaining crop yield. Additionally, the overall low emissions may be attributed to the relatively high soil pH (8.17), which influences the denitrification product ratio, favoring the conversion of N2O to N-2. Our study provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to N2O emissions in integrated crop-livestock farming systems, and highlights the importance of distinguishing multiple sources of N2O emissions to develop effective strategies for reducing emissions while promoting sustainable agriculture.

AB Maize production plays an important role in global food security, especially in arid and poor-soil regions. Its production is also increasing in China in terms of both planting area and yield. However, maize productivity in rainfed croplands is constrained by low soil fertility and moisture insufficiency. To increase the maize yield, local farmers use NPK fertilizer. However, the fertilization regime (CF) they practice is unbalanced with too much nitrogen in proportion to both phosphorus and potassium, which has led to low fertilizer use efficiency and excessive greenhouse gases emissions. A two-year field experiment was conducted to assess whether a high yielding but low greenhouse gases emission system could be developed by the combination of balanced fertilization (BF) and biochar amendment in a rainfed farmland located in the Northern region of China. Biochar was applied at rates of 0, 20, and 40 t/ha. Results show that BF and biochar increased maize yield and partial nutrient productivity and decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. Under BF the maize yield was 23.7% greater than under CF. N2O emissions under BF were less than half that under CF due to a reduced N fertilizer application rate. Biochar amendment decreased N2O by more than 31% under CF, while it had no effect on N2O emissions under BF. Thus BF was effective at maintaining a high maize yield and reducing greenhouse gases emissions. If combined with biochar amendment, BF would be a good way of sustaining low carbon agriculture in rainfed areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biochar application has been reported to effectively mitigate N2O emissions and increase crop yield; however, its long-term residual effects remain largely unknown. A four-year field experiment was designed in the North China Plain (NCP) to evaluate the residual effect of biochar on N2O and NO emissions and crop yield under maize-wheat rotation. The study included five treatments: no N fertilization (Control), N fertilizer application (CN), and N fertilizer plus maize-straw biochar application at 3 (NB3), 6 (NB6) and 12 t ha(-1) (NB12). Biochar amendment had no effect on maize yield during the four-year rotation, but increased maize grain N uptake by 12.9 - 14.1 % and fertilizer N use efficiency by 13.8 % in the fourth year. Meanwhile, NB12 treatment decreased wheat yield by 11.7 - 15.5 % in each year, except the second, while decreased average wheat yield. Biochar application significantly reduced N2O emissions by 31.5 - 42.4 % during the first maize season, and by 6.9 - 21.3 % in the third and fourth years primarily due to reduction in NH4+ availability for nitrification. Furthermore, this mitigation effect was positively related to soil moisture content and decreased with time after biochar application. Cumulative N2O emissions during the four wheat seasons were 0.25 - 0.85 kg N2O-N ha(-1), and only decreased by 8.9 - 9.9 % under biochar amendment in the third and fourth years probably because low soil temperature suppressed N2O production. Biochar addition in the third and fourth years significantly reduced NO emissions by 9.0 - 20.1 % during the maize growing seasons and 10.5 - 19.1 % during the wheat growing seasons, especially under NB6 treatment. The average yield-scaled N2O and NO emissions were lowest in the NB6 treatment during the maize and wheat season. Overall, these findings suggest that 6 t ha(-1) is the optimal biochar application rate for reducing N2O/NO emissions and yield-scaled N2O/NO emission under four-year maize-wheat rotation in the NCP.

AB Emissions of nitrogen compounds from heavily fertilized and irrigated maize fields have been studied in the Southwest of France, over an annual cultivation cycle. Strong nitrous oxide emissions from denitrification were observed after application of nitrogen fertilizer. Flux intensity appears to be stimulated by rain or irrigation. Emission algorithms, taking into account both nitrogen input and soil water content were established on the basis of the experimental data set. They allowed us to estimate annual nitrogen loss in the form of nitrous oxide modulated by rainfall. Production of methane is observed at the level of the water table under anoxic conditions. Nevertheless, the net flux between soil and atmosphere is negative for most of the time. When methane is produced, fluxes were very low due to methane oxidation in the soil surface layer.

AB AimsCup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) contributes to sustainable bioenergy production. However, little is known about the role of intensive litter fall and increased soil biodiversity on respiration and denitrification in its cultivation. This study aimed to assess CO2, N2O and N2 emissions of annual and perennial energy cropping systems affected by earthworms when supplied with senescent cup plant or maize litter.MethodsIn a 32-day laboratory incubation, the 15N gas flux method was applied in an N2-reduced atmosphere to a repacked silt loam soil, inoculated with Lumbricus terrestris L., and amended with senescent maize and cup plant litter. During incubation, CO2, N2O and N2 emissions were measured. After incubation, NO3-, NH4+, total C, and total N was analysed in soil and casts. Litter removal from the soil surface and net nitrification rates were calculated.ResultsEarthworms caused a fivefold increase in maize litter removal and a threefold increase regarding cup plant litter. Highest N2O + N2 fluxes were observed in treatments with earthworms and cup plant litter, although the high CN ratio of senescent cup plant litter implied higher N immobilisation than the CN ratio of senescent maize litter. Earthworms increased CO2, N2O, and especially N2 emissions lowering the product ratio of denitrification (N2Oi).ConclusionsEarthworm-controlled litter incorporation increased labile C from decomposition of recalcitrant litter as substrate for denitrification. Mineralisation patterns of senescent litter cannot be explained by CN ratio alone. The combination of both mechanisms affected denitrification, lead to elevated N2O and N2 emissions and N loss from the soil.

AB Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, with N fertilizers being one of its major sources. Plant growth-promoting bacteria have been used to mitigate N2O emissions by improving N use efficiency in plants. In addition, some of these microorganisms are capable of reducing N2O to N2, a process that could be further explored as a complementary mitigation strategy. This study aimed to test whether Azospirillum brasilense strains Ab-V5 and Ab-V6, and strain Wa3, as well as Nitrospirillum viridazoti strain BR 11145, already used in commercial inoculants for N-fertilized crops and known to carry the nosZ gene encoding nitrous oxide reductase, could act as biological sinks for this gas. In the pot experiment, soils fertilized with N and inoculated with N. viridazoti exhibited consistently lower N2O emissions, but not when A. brasilense strains were used. The mitigation effect was observed both in bare soil (72% emission reduction) and in the presence of millet plants (60% emission reduction), confirming the ability of N. viridazoti strain BR 11145 to consume N2O. In a field experiment conducted with maize, inoculation with N. viridazoti again reduced N2O fluxes during the first two weeks after fertilization compared with the urea-only treatment. However, no significant differences were detected comparing emission factors, whose calculation requires consideration of the entire monitoring period, thereby adding more variability. While N2O mitigation was observed, no significant effects of inoculation or N fertilization were found on maize growth or yield. Nonetheless, the consistent reduction in N2O emissions achieved with N. viridazoti strain BR 11145 suggests that inoculants with this bacterium represent a promising biological sink for N2O, offering a novel nature-based solution to enhance the sustainability of tropical crop management.

AB A 3-year field experiment (October 2004-October 2007) was conducted to quantify N2O fluxes and determine the regulating factors from rain-fed, N fertilized wheat-maize rotation in the Sichuan Basin, China.
   Static chamber-GC techniques were used to measure soil N2O fluxes in three treatments (three replicates per treatment): CK (no fertilizer); N150 (300 kg N fertilizer ha(-1) yr(-1) or 150 kg N ha(-1) per crop); N250 (500 kg N fertilizer ha(-1) yr(-1) kg or 250 kg N ha(-1) per crop). Nitrate (NO (3) (-) ) leaching losses were measured at nearby sites using free-drained lysimeters.
   The annual N2O fluxes from the N fertilized treatments were in the range of 1.9 to 6.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) corresponding to an N2O emission factor ranging from 0.12 % to 1.06 % (mean value: 0.61 %). The relationship between monthly soil N2O fluxes and NO (3) (-) leaching losses can be described by a significant exponential decaying function.
   The N2O emission factor obtained in our study was somewhat lower than the current IPCC default emission factor (1 %). Nitrate leaching, through removal of topsoil NO (3) (-) , is an underrated regulating factor of soil N2O fluxes from cropland, especially in the regions where high NO (3) (-) leaching losses occur.

AB The zero tillage (ZT) system is used in a large area (> 24 Mha) of crop production in Brazil. This management system can contribute to soil C sequestration, but many studies in other countries have registered greater nitrous oxide emissions under ZT compared to conventional tillage (CT), which may reduce greenhouse gas mitigation benefits. The aim of this study was to estimate the emission of N2O from cropping systems under conventional and zero tillage in an 18-year-old experiment conducted on a Rhodic Ferralsol in the South of Brazil. Fluxes of N2O were measured over two years using static-closed chambers in the two tillage systems with three crop rotations. Soil water filled pore space (% WFPS) and soil mineral N were monitored along with rainfall and air temperature. Estimates of N2O emissions were obtained by integrating the fluxes with time and also by applying the IPCC direct emission factor (EF1 = 1%) to the amounts of N added as fertilisers and returned as crop residues. Fluxes of N2O were relatively low, apart from a short period at the beginning of measurements. No relationship between N2O fluxes and % WFPS or mineral N were observed. Nitrous oxide emissions were not influenced either by tillage system or crop rotation. For the crop rotation receiving high rates of N fertiliser in the second year, field-measured N2O emissions were significantly underestimated by the IPCC emission factor 1 (EF1). For the other treatments measured N2O emissions fell within the EF1 uncertainty range, but always considerably lower than the EF1 estimate, which suggests IPCC EF1 overestimates true N2O emissions for the Ferralsol under evaluation.

AB Agricultural soil has been recognized as a major source of atmospheric NO and N2O emissions which have important impacts on regional and global environments. Here we comparably investigated the effects of ammonium, nitrate fertilizers and nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) addition on NO and N2O emissions from the agricultural soil in the North China Plain (NCP). Compared with the ammonium fertilizer application, the reductions of NO emissions caused by nitrate fertilizer and DCD addition were 100% and 93%, and of N2O emissions were 54% and 74%, respectively. Remarkable reductions of NO and N2O emissions were also observed from five different agricultural soils in the NCP by replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer, indicating that nitrification is the predominant process for the emissions of NO and N2O from the soils in the vast area of NCP. NO emission peaks were found to be several days later than N2O peaks after the application of ammonium fertilizer and flooding irrigation, implying that most of NO initially produced via nitrification process might be fast reduced to N2O under the high soil moisture condition. Interestingly, the relative contribution of denitrification to N2O emission showed obviously time-dependent, e.g., evident N2O emission caused by the application of nitrate was only observed after the basal fertilization for the maize and the top dressing for the wheat. Replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer and mixing with the nitrification inhibitor are verified to be effective measures for mitigating NO and N2O emissions from arable soils in the NCP.

AB In irrigated Mediterranean conditions there is a lack of knowledge about the best combination of tillage and N fertilization practices to reduce soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions while maintaining maize productivity. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of different soil management practices and synthetic N fertilization rates on soil N2O emissions and their relationship with maize grain yield to determine the best management system to reduce yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSNE) in a semiarid area recently converted to irrigation under Mediterranean conditions. A long-term tillage and N rate field experiment established in 1996 under barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) rainfed conditions, was converted to irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) in 2015. After the transformation to irrigation, the field experiment maintained the same tillage treatments and N fertilization rates. Three types of tillage (conventional tillage, CT; reduced tillage, RT; no-tillage, NT) and three mineral N fertilization rates (0, 200, 400 kg N ha(-1)) were compared during three years (2015-2017) in a randomized block design with three replications. Soil N2O emissions, water-filled pore space, soil temperature, mineral N content (as NH4+ and NO3-), denitrification potential and maize grain yield and above-ground N uptake were quantified. Moreover, the emission factor (EF) and YSNE were calculated. The results showed that the combination of NT and the highest rate of N fertilization led to greater N2O emissions. Furthermore, the lowest N2O fluxes were observed in CT when WFPS was below 40% and the highest N2O fluxes were seen in NT when WFPS was above 60% coinciding with the greatest denitrification potential. Cumulative N2O emissions in 2017 and 2015 followed the order 400 > 200 > 0 kg N ha(-1), while in 2016, rate of 400 and 200 kg N ha(-1) showed greater cumulative N2O emission compared to the control. Only RT showed differences between growing seasons on cumulative N2O emissions, with greater values in 2017 compared to 2015, and intermediate values in 2016. In all treatments, the N2O EF was much lower than the default IPCC emission factor (1%). NT and RT increased the grain production compared to CT which was affected by severe soil crusting causing water deficit. Likewise, N fertilizer treatments significantly affected the YSNE, increasing with increasing fertilizer N application rate in the first year of study. Our data show that the use of NT or RT does not lead to more yield-scaled N2O emissions than CT in Mediterranean agroecosystems recently converted to irrigation.

AB Silage maize cultivation is gaining importance in organic farming, and thus its environmental and climate impacts. The effects of digestate fertilization in combination with different catch crops and tillage intensities in maize cultivation are investigated in a long-term field experiment in southern Germany. The tested variants are (a) maize after winter rye, plowed, unfertilized and (b) fertilized with biogas digestate, (c) maize after legume-rich cover crop mixture, mulch seeding, fertilized with digestate, and (d) maize in a white clover living mulch system, fertilized with digestate. Over three years (2019 to 2021), crop yields and N balance were analyzed, N2O emissions were measured in high temporal resolution using the closed chamber method, and soil moisture, ammonium, and nitrate contents were continuously determined. Maize dry matter yields ranged from 4.2 Mg ha(-1) (variant a, 2021) to 24.4 Mg ha(-1) (variant c, 2020) depending on cropping intensity and annual weather conditions. Despite relatively high nitrogen fertilization with digestate, the N balances were negative or nearly balanced; only in 2021 did the N surplus exceed 100 kg ha(-1) (variant b and c) due to low yields. In maize cultivation, relatively low N2O-N emissions (1.0 to 3.2 kg ha(-1)) were measured in the unfertilized variant (a), and very high emissions in variant b (5.6 to 19.0 kg ha(-1)). The sometimes extremely high N2O emissions are also due to soil and climatic conditions (high denitrification potential). The experimental results show that cover crops, living mulch, and reduced tillage intensity in silage maize cultivation can reduce N2O emissions, improve nitrogen balance and increase maize yields.

AB Agricultural activities are co-responsible for the emission of the most important greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Development of methodologies to improve monitoring techniques for N2O are still needful. The LIFE-r-IPNOA project aims to improve the emissions monitoring of nitrous oxide from agricultural soils and to identify the agricultural practices that can limit N2O production. In order to achieve this objective, both a mobile and a stationary instrument were developed and validated. Several experimental field trials were set up in two different sites investigating the most representative crops of Tuscany (Central Italy). namely durum wheat, maize, sunflower, tomato and faba bean. The field trials were realized in order to test the effect on N2O emissions of key factors: tillage intensity, nitrogen fertiliser rate and irrigation. The field trial on durum wheat was set up in 2013 to test the effect of tillage intensity (minimum and conventional tillage) and nitrogen fertilisation rate (0, 110, 170 kg N ha (1)) on soil N2O flux. Monitoring was carried out using the IPNOA mobile prototype. Preliminary results on N2O emissions for the durum wheat growing season showed that mean daily NO fluxes ranged from -0.13 to 6.43 mg m (2) day (1) and cumulative N2O-N emissions over the period ranged from 827 to 2340 g N2O-N ha(-1). Tillage did not affect N2O flux while increasing nitrogen fertilisation rate resulted to significantly increase N2O emissions. The IPNOA mobile prototype performed well during this first year of monitoring, allowing to catch both very low fluxes and peaks on N2O emissions after nitrogen supply, showing a good suitability to the field conditions.

AB Split application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers during different crop growth stages to fulfill the crop N requirements reduces soil mineral N concentrations and improves the efficiency of crop N fertilizer use, and can decrease nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from the soil. However, inconsistent results regarding N2O emissions have been reported in rainfed areas. Furthermore, few long-term studies have explained the effects of split N application on soil methane (CH4) flux, thus limiting complete assessment of the effects of split N application on total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, long-term monitoring is urgently required to understand the impacts of split N application on GHG emissions in rainfed areas. In this study, a 6-year field experiment was conducted in a rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) field in Northeast China. The experiment included three treatments: no N application representing control (CK), single application at the sowing stage of maize (SU), and split N at the sowing and jointing stages at a ratio of 1: 2 (SF). Between the sowing and jointing stages, N2O emissions were significantly higher in SU than in SF. However, high N2O emissions were observed in SF for 1 month after N application at the jointing stage possibly because the time of N application coincided with optimum precipitation and soil temperature conditions, which stimulated N2O emissions. Overall, the total N2O emissions showed no significant difference between SU and SF. During the study period, split application of N fertilizer did not significantly affect the cumulative CH4 flux. Compared to CK, the yield-scaled GWP in SF treatment increased by 18.7% (p < 0.05). Ammonia (NH3) volatilization in SF was 272% higher than that in SU. The findings indicated that split N application exhibited an environmental risk by increasing the yield-scaled GWP and NH3 emissions in the field. Thus, this study suggested that single N application applied in the sowing stage should be employed in rainfed fields to mitigate the yield-scaled GWP and NH3 emissions, and maintain efficient maize yields.

AB Straw return in combination with synthetic N fertilizer is considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield. Such practice, however, can considerably modify soil microbial activity and relative C and N availability, both of which are known to regulate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Minimizing these emissions per unit of crop yield is a prerequisite to minimize the environmental footprint of agricultural production and thus, a policy objective. In our study, we quantified N2O and NO emissions and determined fertilizer-N use efficiencies (NUE) and crop yields of two double-cropping (summer maize/Welsh onion-winter wheat) systems with and without straw incorporation in the North China Plain. Relative to the fertilized treatment without straw amendments, straw incorporation showed a significant inhibitory effect on annual N2O emissions from the maize-wheat system (-31%), but no significant effect was observed for the Welsh onion-wheat system. However, straw return significantly reduced annual NO emissions by >30% for both systems. Meanwhile, straw return in both systems significantly increased the NUE and crop yields by 34-47% and 7-16%, respectively, as compared to the treatment without straw additions. Across the double-cropping systems, annual direct emission factors of N2O, NO and N2O + NO were 0.37-0.57%, 0.08-0.78% and 0.57-1.36%, respectively. Furthermore, a negative relationship between direct emission factors of N2O + NO and crop NUE was observed, highlighting the importance of optimizing NUE for reducing environmental risks of a cropping system. When expressing emissions on a yield basis, straw return significantly reduced annual yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions by 15-42% for both systems. Overall, our results show that the combined application of crop straw and synthetic N fertilizer is a promising N management strategy for maximizing crop yields while mitigating N-trace gas emissions.

AB Agricultural ecosystems are important contributors to atmospheric greenhouse gasses (GHGs); however, in situ winter emission data in saline-alkali fields are scarce. Gas samples were collected during different periods, from three rice (R1-R3) and three maize (M1-M3) fields with different soil pH levels and salinity conditions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the rice and maize fields decreased with decreasing temperature during the freezing period and increased with the rising temperature during the thawing period, with the majority of winter CO2 emissions occurring during these two periods. Peaks in methane (CH4) emissions were observed during the freezing period in the rice fields and during the snow-melting period in the rice and maize fields. CH4 emissions in the rice fields and CH4 uptake rates in the maize fields were significantly (P < 0.05) related to surface soil temperature. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remained relatively low, except for during the peaks observed during the snow-melting period in both the rice and maize fields, leading to the high GHG contribution of the snow-melting period throughout the winter. Higher pH and salinity conditions consistently resulted in lower CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, CH4 uptake, and lower global warming potential (GWP). These results can contribute to the assessment of the GWP during winter in saline-alkali regions.

AB The exchange fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) from a maize field with three different treatments were simultaneously measured using static and dynamic chambers in the North China Plain (NCP) from June 28 to October 11, 2009. The three treatments included control plot (CK, without crop, fertilization and irrigation), fertilizer N plot (NP) and wheat straw returning plus fertilizer N plot (SN). N-fertilizer application greatly stimulated the emissions of N2O, NOx and NH3, with durations of about 10 days for N2O and NO, and about 7 days for NH3. Fertilizer loss rates were 1.08% (NP plot) and 1.20% (SN plot) as N2O-N, were 1.93% (NP plot) and 0.76% (SN plot) as NO-N, and were 5.24% (NP plot) and 3.03% (SN plot) as NH3-N. In comparison with the NP plot, the significant low fertilizer loss rates as NO-N and NH3-N from the SN plot indicated that the wheat straw returning to the field could reduce NOx and NH3 emissions. The molar ratio of NO/N2O was greater than unity for most data during the pulse emission periods induced by fertilization, and thus, nitrification was the dominant process for N2O and NO emissions during these periods. Considering the significant amount (>80%) of N2O and NOx emissions occurred during the pulse emission periods, the emissions of NOx and N2O from the investigated field were mainly ascribed to nitrification process.

AB Soilborne pests are a major obstacle that must be overcome for the production of horticultural crops. Methyl bromide (MBr) was an effective preplanting soil broad-spectrum biocide, but its use has been banned due to its role in depleting the ozone layer. As a result, sustainable alternative methods for controlling soilborne pathogens and pests are needed. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are of concern in crop production due to the role of N2O as a greenhouse gas. Agricultural lands are known sources for emission of N2O into the atmosphere. Emissions are related to many environmental factors as well as fertilization and fumigation practices. This study evaluated the influence of different alternatives to MBr on N2O emissions throughout a tomato production season in two locations representative of southern and northern Florida. We evaluated eight soil management practices, including (a) untreated controls; (b) chemical soil fumigation; (c) anaerobic soil disinfestation using molasses (M) + composted poultry litter and (d and e) M + composted yard waste (CYW, at two rates); (f) Soil Symphony Amendment (SSA), a commercially available mix of microbes and nutrients; (g) CYW alone; and (h) CYW + SSA. Nitrous oxide emissions were measured throughout the cropping season. Emissions were highest on the day of planting (Day 21), ranging from 213 to 1,878 mu g m(-2) h(-1), likely due to the release of N2O that had accumulated under the totally impermeable film when it was punctured for planting. However, statistical significance varied between sites. Estimated cumulative emissions of N2O throughout the production season ranged from 1.3 to 4.8 kg N2O-N ha(-1).

AB To better understand the effects of plastic film mulching on soil greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, we compared seasonal and vertical variations of GHG concentrations at seven soil depths in maize (Zea mays L.) fields at Changwu station in Shaanxi, a semi-humid region, between 2012 and 2013. Gas samples were taken simultaneously every one week from non-mulched (BP) and plastic film-mulched (FM) field plots. The results showed that the concentration of GHGs varied distinctly at the soil-atmosphere interface and in the soil profile during the maize growing season (MS). Both carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations increased with increasement of soil depth, while the methane (CH4) concentrations decreased with increasement of soil depth. A strong seasonal variation pattern was found for CO2 and N2O concentrations, as compared to an inconspicuous seasonal variation of CH4 concentrations. The mean CO2 and N2O concentrations were higher, but the mean CH4 concentration in the soil profiles was lower in the FM plots than in the BP plots. The results of this study suggested that plastic film mulching significantly increased the potential emissions of CO2 and N2O from the soil, and promoted CH4 absorption by the soil, particularly during the MS.

A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted for 84 days under controlled conditions (24 degrees C and moisture content 55% of water-holding capacity) to study the influence of sugarcane, maize, sorghum, cotton and lucerne residues, and mineral N addition, on N mineralization immobilization and N2O emission. Residues were added at the rate of 3 t C ha(-1) to soil with, and without, 150 kg urea N ha(-1). The addition of sugarcane, maize, and sorghum residues without N fertilizer resulted in a significant immobilization of soil N. Amended soil had significantly (P<0.05) lower NO3--N, which reached minimum values of 2.8 mg N kg(-1) for sugarcane (at day 28), 10.3 mg N kg(-1) for maize (day 7), and 5.9 mg N kg(-1) for sorghum (day 7), compared to 22.7 mg N kg(-1) for the unamended soil (day 7). During 84 days of incubation, the total mineral N in the residues+N treatments were decreased by 45 mg N kg(-1) in sugarcane, 34 mg kg(-1) in maize, 29 mg kg(-1) in sorghum, and 16 mg kg(-1) in cotton amended soil compared to soil+N fertilizer, although soil NO3--N increased by 7 mg kg(-1) in lucerne amended soil. The addition of residues also significantly increased amended soil microbial biomass C and N. Maximum emissions of N2O from crop residue amended soils occurred in the first 4-5 days of incubation. Overall, after 84 days of incubation, the cumulative N2O emission was 25% lower with cotton+N fertilizer, compared to soil+N fertilizer. The cumulative N2O emission was significantly and positively correlated with NO3--N (r=0.92, P < 0.01) and total mineral N (r=0.93, P<0.01) after 84 days of incubation, and had a weak but significant positive correlation with cumulative CO2 in the first 3 and 5 days of incubation (r=0.59, P< 0.05).

AB Maintaining or even increasing crop yields while reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is necessary to reconcile food security and climate change, while the metric of yield-scaled N2O emission (i.e., N2O emissions per unit of crop yield) is at present poorly understood. Here we conducted a global meta-analysis with more than 6000 observations to explore the variation patterns and controlling factors of yield-scaled N2O emissions for maize, wheat and rice and associated potential mitigation options. Our results showed that the average yield-scaled N2O emissions across all available data followed the order wheat (322 g N Mg-1, with the 95% confidence interval [CI]: 301-346) > maize (211 g N Mg-1, CI: 198-225) > rice (153 g N Mg-1, CI: 144-163). Yield-scaled N2O emissions for individual crops were generally higher in tropical or subtropical zones than in temperate zones, and also showed a trend towards lower intensities from low to high latitudes. This global variation was better explained by climatic and edaphic factors than by N fertilizer management, while their combined effect predicted more than 70% of the variance. Furthermore, our analysis showed a significant decrease in yield-scaled N2O emissions with increasing N use efficiency or in N2O emissions for production systems with cereal yields >10 Mg ha(-1) (maize), 6.6 Mg ha(-1) (wheat) or 6.8 Mg ha(-1) (rice), respectively. This highlights that N use efficiency indicators can be used as valuable proxies for reconciling trade-offs between crop production and N2O mitigation. For all three major staple crops, reducing N fertilization by up to 30%, optimizing the timing and placement of fertilizer application or using enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers significantly reduced yield-scaled N2O emissions at similar or even higher cereal yields. Our data-driven assessment provides some key guidance for developing effective and targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies for the sustainable intensification of cereal production.

AB Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from agricultural soils contribute significantly to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. Numerous studies have been conducted during the last three decades to improve the understanding of the processes involved in the release of N2O from agricultural soils. This enabled the creation of process based models on site and field scale. In addition, a growing number of N2O emission data are available for different soil-land-use-systems from various climates. The integration of these data in global and national N2O budgets leads to more improved estimations. Surprisingly, N2O-emission calculations are rare on regional meso and macro scales. The spatial identification of areas with a high efflux of N2O on regional meso and macro scales is essential for the implementation of N2O emission mitigation strategies, thus leading to an increased sustainability of land use. On the basis of the ecosystem approach of Matson and Vitousek (1990), we introduce a new method to estimate regional N2O emissions from agricultural soils on meso and macro scales. This method considers spatial environmental information from available spatial and statistical data as well as quantitative and qualitative expertise by using the tools of a geographic information system (GIS). An environmental information system (EIS) was built up for a dairy farm region in Southern Germany which includes soil, land use, topography, N2O emission and farm management data. Using all information in the EIS, it was possible (i) to identify different spatial soil-land-use-systems, (ii) to link emission data and process knowledge to these soil-land-use-systems and (iii) to visualize spatial emission potentials. On this basis, N2O emission potentials for each of the communities in the study region and the whole region were estimated. The estimated annual N2O emission potential from agricultural soils for the examined dairy farm region in Southern Germany covering around 775 km(2) is about 3.0 kg N2O-N ha(-1).

AB To investigate the effects of maize/legume intercropping on soil N2O emissions, six treatments were tested in the North China Plain: maize, M120 (N application rate 120 kg ha-1); maize, M240 (N application rate 240 kg ha-1); soybean (Glycine max), SS (120 kg ha-1); maize/soybean intercropping, MS (120 kg ha-1); peanut (Arachis hypogaea), PP (120 kg ha-1); and maize/peanut intercropping, MP (120 kg ha-1). The amounts of inorganic nitrogen for the 0-20 cm soil in MS were 24.0%, 5.3%, and 29.3% lower than in SS, M120, and M240, respectively (P < 0.05). The total N2O emissions ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.09 to 0.98 +/- 0.14 kg ha-1. MP and MS were statistically different at the 95% confidence level, whereas MP produced the least N2O emissions at 0.41 kg ha-1. The seasonal cumulative N2O emissions and global warming potential in MS and MP were also significantly lower than those in the other three monoculture treatments (P < 0.001). The results demonstrated that maize/legume intercropping can increase the N uptake of crops and reduce the amount of soil inorganic nitrogen and N2O emissions, thereby, ensuring the sustainability of the agricultural environment.

AB Application of controlled release urea (CRU) is recommended to reduce the undesirable environmental effects resulting from urea application. However, the overall effects of CRU on maize productivity and reactive nitrogen (N) losses remain unclear. Our global meta-analysis based on 866 observations of 120 studies indicated that application of CRU instead of urea (same N rate) increased maize yield by 5.3% and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by 24.1%, and significantly decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, N leaching and ammonia (NH3) volatilization by 23.8%, 27.1% and 39.4%, respectively. The increase of NUE and reduction of N2O emission by CRU application were greater with medium and high N rates (150 <= N < 200 and N >= 200 kg N ha(-1)) than with low N rates. The reduction in N2O emission and N leaching with CRU application were enhanced when soil organic carbon (SOC) content was <15.0 g kg(-1), and soil texture was medium or coarse. The reduction in N2O emission and NH3 volatilization with CRU were greater in soils with pH >= 6.0. We concluded that use of CRU should be encouraged for maize production, especially on light-textured soils with low organic matter content. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cropland intensification is needed to meet the demand for food in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This process requires a dramatic increase in resource inputs, including fertilizer-nitrogen (N) and organic residues (e.g., stover), which alter the soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O). The dearth of N2O emission data for SSA croplands, however, limits our ability to define regional and global N2O flux and mitigation opportunities. In two soils planted with maize in Tanzania (Iringa, sandy Alfisols; Mbeya, clayey Andisols), we conducted year-round measurements for 2 consecutive years to quantify N2O emissions in response to increasing N rates and in combination with maize stover incorporation. Rainfall and the resulting soil moisture, rather than soil temperature, were important environmental drivers of N2O emissions in these fields. Applied N stimulated N2O fluxes across soil types but with different magnitudes-lower in Iringa because of the dominance of nitrification in N2O production and higher in Mbeya likely from promoted denitrification when the water-filled pore space was > 47%. N2O emission increased exponentially or linearly with N rate, depending on the year. The direct N2O emission factors were well below the 1% of the IPCC Tier 1 method, ranging from 0.13% to 0.26% in Iringa and from 0.24% to 0.42% in Mbeya, for a N rate of 50-150 kg N ha(-1) during the study. Compared with N application alone, stover plus N did not significantly alter maize yield, but did raise N2O emissions significantly (P <= 0.06). Consequently, stover incorporation markedly increased the emission factor (up to 0.46% in Iringa and 1.29% in Mbeya) as well as yield-scaled N2O emissions. Our results suggest that linear and exponential emission responses can occur in SSA croplands and challenge the promotion of combining stover with fertilizer N as resource input management in this region.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and denitrification losses from an irrigated sandy loam soil amended with composted municipal solid waste (MSW), sheep manure (SM), surface applied pig slurry (SPS), incorporated pig slurry (IPS) or urea (U) were studied under Mediterranean conditions. We quantified emissions, in both the presence and absence of maize and N2O production, via denitrification and nitrification pathways using varying concentrations of acetylene. Discounting the N2O lost in the Control, the percentages of N2O lost in relation to the total N applied were greater for urea (1.80%) than for MSW (0.50%), SM (0.46%), SPS (1.02%) or IPS (1.27%). In general, plots treated with organic fertilisers emitted higher amounts of N2O when under maize than bare soil plots. On the other hand, greater denitrification losses were also recorded for plots in the absence of plants (between 9.7 and 29.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) than for areas with plants (between 7.1 and 24.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1)). The proportion of N2O produced via denitrification was greater from fertiliser treatments than for the controls and also greater without plants (between 66 and 91 % of the N2O emitted) than with plants (between 48 and 81%).

AB Background and aims Crop residue retention and cover cropping are key strategies in conservation agriculture, but their effects on nitrogen (N) cycling and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, particularly in semiarid croplands, remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the N dynamics and N2O sources in an irrigated cover crop-maize rotation in central Spain by conducting a N-15 tracing experiment. Methods N-15-labeled maize (Zea mays L.) residues were incorporated into the soil, followed by vetch (Vicia faba L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cover crops, or bare fallow. A subsequent maize crop was fertilized with 210 kg N ha(-1) as ammonium nitrate (AN) or N-15-labeled AN ((NH4NO3)-N-15, (15)AN//(NH4NO3)-N-15, A(15)N) in the microplots receiving N-15-enriched or unlabeled maize residues, respectively. Results Cumulative N2O emissions were 47% higher under vetch than under barley. Average N2O emission factors were 0.05% for N-15-labeled residues and 0.23% for fertilizer. Most N2O originated from (15)AN (42%-61%), followed by endogenous sources (i.e., mineralization of organic N from soil or crop residues, 19%-42%) and A(15)N (9%-18%). Maize recovered 7.7% of residue N, with no differences between cover cropping treatments. Plant uptake from A(15)N was 2.3 times higher than from (15)AN. Across barley, vetch, and fallow, total N recovery averaged 33% in plants and 22% in soil. Barley cover cropping improved fertilizer N recovery in maize by 57% (P < 0.05) compared with fallow. Conclusion These findings highlight the role of cereal cover crops and the regulation of ammonium oxidation-based processes in enhancing N use efficiency and reducing fertilizer-derived N2O emissions in semiarid agro-ecosystems.

AB The application of nitrification inhibitors together with ammonium-based fertilizers is proposed as a potent method to decrease nitrous oxide (N2O) emission while promoting crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency in fertilized agricultural fields. To evaluate the effects of nitrification inhibitors, we conducted year-round measurements of N2O fluxes, yield, aboveground biomass, plant carbon and nitrogen contents, soil inorganic nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon contents and the main environmental factors for urea (U), urea + dicyandiamide (DCD) and urea +3,4-dimethylpyrazol phosphate (DMPP) treatments in a wheat-maize rotation field. The cumulative N2O emissions were calculated to be 4.49 +/- 0.21, 2.93 +/- 0.06 and 2.78 +/- 0.16 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the U, DCD and DMPP treatments, respectively. Therefore, the DCD and DMPP treatments significantly decreased the annual emissions by 35% and 38 %, respectively (p < 0.01). The variations of soil temperature, moisture and inorganic nitrogen content regulated the seasonal fluctuation of N2O emissions. When the emissions presented clearly temporal variations, high-frequency measurements or optimized sampling schedule for intermittent measurements would likely provide more accurate estimations of annual cumulative emission and treatment effect. The application of nitrification inhibitors significantly increased the soil inorganic nitrogen content (p < 0.01); shifted the main soil inorganic nitrogen form from nitrate to ammonium; and tended to increase the dissolved organic carbon content, crop yield, aboveground biomass and nitrogen uptake by aboveground plant. The results demonstrate the roles the nitrification inhibitors play in enhancing yield and nitrogen use efficiency and reducing N2O emission from the wheat-maize cropping system.

AB Topography affects soil hydrological, pedological, and biochemical processes and may influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions into the atmosphere. While N2O emissions from agricultural fields are mainly measured at plot scale and on flat topography, intrafield topographical and crop growth variability alter soil processes and might impact N2O emissions. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of topographical variations on crop growth period dependent soil N2O emissions at the field scale. A field experiment was conducted at two agricultural farms (Baggs farm; BF and Research North; RN) with undulating topography. Dominant slope positions (upper, middle, lower and toeslope) were identified based on elevation difference. Soil and gas samples were collected from four replicated locations within each slope position over the whole corn growing season (May-October 2019) to measure soil physio-chemical properties and N2O emissions. The N2O emissions at BF ranged from -0.27 +/- 0.42 to 255 +/- 105 g ha(-1) d(-1). Higher cumulative emissions were observed from the upper slope (1040 +/- 487 g ha(-1)) during early growing season and from the toeslope (371 +/- 157 g ha(-1)) during the late growing season with limited variations during the mid growing season. Similarly, at RN farm, (emissions ranged from -0.50 +/- 0.83 to 70 +/- 15 g ha(-1) d(-1)), the upper slope had higher cumulative emissions during early (576 +/- 132 g ha(-1)) and mid (271 +/- 51 g ha(-1)) growing season, whereas no impact of slope positions was observed during late growing season. Topography controlled soil and environmental properties differently at different crop growth periods; thus, intrafield variability must be considered in estimating N2O emissions and emission factor calculation from agricultural fields. However, due to large spatial variations in N2O emissions, further explorations into site-specific analysis of individual soil properties and their impact on N2O emissions using multiyear data might help to understand and identify hotspots of N2O emissions.

AB Nitrification inhibitors have the potential to reduce N2O emissions from maize fields, but optimal results may depend on deployment of integrated N fertilizer management systems that increase yields achieved per unit of N2O lost. A new micro-encapsulated formulation of nitrapyrin for liquid N fertilizers became available to US farmers in 2010. Our research objectives were to (i) assess the impacts of urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) management practices (timing, rate and nitrification inhibitor) and environmental variables on growing-season N2O fluxes and (ii) identify UAN treatment combinations that both reduce N2O emissions and optimize maize productivity. Field experiments near West Lafayette, Indiana in 2010 and 2011 examined three N rates (0, 90 and 180 kg N ha(-1)), two timings (pre-emergence and side-dress) and presence or absence of nitrapyrin. Mean cumulative N2O-N emissions (Q(10) corrected) were 0.81, 1.83 and 3.52 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the rates of 0, 90 and 180 kg N ha(-1), respectively; 1.80 and 2.31 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for pre-emergence and side-dress timings, respectively; and 1.77 versus 2.34 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for with and without nitrapyrin, respectively. Yield-scaled N2O-N emissions increased with N rates as anticipated (averaging 167, 204 and 328 g N2O-N Mg grain(-1) for the 0, 90 and 180 kg N ha(-1) rates), but were 22% greater with the side-dress timing than the pre-emergence timing (when averaged across N rates and inhibitor treatments) because of environmental conditions following later applications. Overall yield-scaled N2O-N emissions were 22% lower with nitrapyrin than without the inhibitor, but these did not interact with N rate or timing.

AB N-15 was used to give evidence of NH3 and N2O absorption by maize leaves. A short-term labelling method (90 min) was chosen with high NH3 concentration (40 mul l-1) to assess uptake mechanisms. Two initial entry pathways were suggested for NH3: fast uptake with immediate metabolism and fast storage with progressive metabolism. A storage compartment delayed NH3 absorption after exposure. Similar mechanisms might be involved in N2O uptake.

AB Field trials were conducted in Haryana representing the northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) to assess the changes brought about by management, including conservation agriculture (CA) practices, in the global warming potential (GWP) of conventional rice-wheat systems. Conservation agriculture is an approach to managing agro-ecosystems for improved and sustained productivity, by way of minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with organic matter or cover crops and crop rotation. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured using static chambers. Experiments involved four cropping system scenarios with different CA components, and different N rates. In addition, emissions of CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured in farmers' fields to establish baselines. The dynamics of CH4 emissions were controlled by floodwater levels, and fertilizer N had no effect. On the other hand, N application rates and timing in relation to soil water status determined the N2O emissions in rice fields. Nitrous oxide fluxes could be avoided by applying N fertilizer to wet soil or by irrigating the field not later than 1 day after N application. Applying crop residues on soil surface had no significant effect on the seasonal CH4 and N2O emissions. It was estimated that switching rice crop establishment method from conventional to CA-based practices in Haryana could reduce GWP for rice by 23% or by 1.26 Tg CO2 eq yr(-1). An intensive CA-based rice-wheat and maize-wheat system reduced GWP by 16-26% or by 1.3-2.0 Tg CO2 eq yr(-1) compared with the conventional rice-wheat system. However, this reduction in GWP would be from a decrease in diesel and electricity consumption and not from direct emissions of CH4 and N2O, which were higher in the maize-wheat system than in the rice-wheat system.

AB Dairy processing sludge is a phosphorus (P) rich waste with a high potential to replace mineral phosphorus fertiliser in crop production, with possible enhancement of greenhouse gas emissions to the environment. Hydrothermal carbonisation is a technology that transforms the sludge into a hydrochar. The objective of this study is examining P availability of two hydrochars produced from Danish and Irish dairy sludge and their influence on greenhouse gas emissions and maize yields. The trial assessed (i) Danish dairy sludge; (ii) hydrochar derived from Danish sludge; (iii) hydrochar made from Irish dairy sludge; (iv) mineral phosphorus fertiliser; and (v) control. Emissions of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, soil pH, mineral nitrogen contents and crop yields were measured. Treatment with Danish dairy sludge had significantly higher cumulative nitrous oxide emissions while the emissions from both hydrochars were not significantly different compared to mineral phosphorous feriliser. Statistical modelling showed that temperature, soil nitrate content, interactions both between temperature and precipitation, and between soil moisture and precipitation were drivers for nitrous oxide emissions. There was no difference in emissions among all treatments when scaled for yield. Hydrochar may alleviate the enhanced nitrous oxide emissions in soil without constraining P availability and maize crop yields.

AB Agricultural soils are the largest anthropogenic emission source of nitrous oxide (N2O). National agricultural policies have been implemented to increase crop yield and reduce nitrogen (N) losses to the environment. However, it is difficult to effectively quantify crop-specific and regional N2O mitigation priorities driven by policies, due to lack of long-term, high-resolution crop-specific activity data, and oversimplified models. Here, we quantify the spatiotemporal changes and key drivers of crop-specific cropland-N2O emissions from China between 1980 and 2017, and future N2O mitigation potentials, using a linear mixed-effect model and survey-based data set of agricultural management measures. Cropland-N2O emissions from China tripled from 102.5 to 315.0 Gg N yr(-1) between 1980 and 2017, and decelerated since 1998 mainly driven by country-wide deceleration and decrease in N rate and the changes in sowing structure. About 63% of N2O emissions could be reduced in 2050, primarily in the North China Plain and Northeast China Plain; 83% of which is from the production of maize (33%), vegetables (27%), and fruits (23%). The deceleration of N2O emissions highlights that policy interventions and agronomy practices (i.e., optimizing N rate and sowing structure) are potential pathways for further ambitious N2O mitigation in China and other developing countries.

AB The promising application modes of organic fertilizer (OF) and chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer (CF) could be the homogeneous granulation (HG: OF and CF are distributed spatially evenly) and spatial heterogeneous granulation (SG: OF and CF are distributed separately in space), where the N transformation processes, such as the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, are greatly influenced by the spatial distribution of the OF and CF, particularly. Currently, there is a lack of in-depth understanding about the microbial mechanisms of the SG and HG application on N2O emissions, and the related functional guilds (ammonia oxidizers and heterotrophic denitrifiers) respond to the granular fertilizer is yet not known. In the present study, we made CF (N-15-(NH4)(2)SO4), cow compost and maize straw (2% or 8% based on the N proportion) into granular of 1 cm in diameter, in HG and SG forms, respectively, and then applied these granules in soils for 80 days incubation. Results showed that, compared with HG treatments, the SG treatment promoted the ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) intensities, and increased the N2O emissions possibly through ammonia oxidize bacteria dependent nitrification and fungal denitrification. In addition, the high maize residues proportion in organic fertilizer significantly mitigated N2O emissions by the coupled impacts of suppressed nitrification and enhanced denitrification enzyme activity with high C input. Overall, our results suggest that spatial heterogeneous granulation of and CF may induce higher risk of N2O emissions and the higher proportion of maize residues could potentially mitigate such increased emissions.

AB Nutrient inputs influence the sustainability of bioenergy crop production through contemporary (shortly after addition) and legacy effects (persisting over years) on microbial nitrogen (N) and carbon cycling, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. However, the relative importance of contemporary and legacy effects and how that could vary by crop functional types is poorly understood. Considering its rhizomatous roots and perennial growth, we hypothesized that Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) would be more sensitive to legacy N fertilization and the historical context of its environment than an annual crop like maize. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of legacy and contemporary N inputs on nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as well as key N cycling genes in soils where Mxg and maize were grown. A 150-day soil incubation experiment was conducted using soils from a long-term Mxg and maize fertility experiment with three historic N fertilization rates (0, 112, and 336 kg N ha-1 year-1) and a contemporary amendment (60 mg N kg-1) with negative control (0 mg N kg-1). We observed significant increases in cumulative N2O emissions in Mxg soils relative to maize soils, particularly at higher legacy fertilization rates, while contemporary N had no significant effect. Bacterial amoA gene abundance, which plays a significant role in nitrification in nutrient-rich soils, also increased with higher legacy fertilization rates in Mxg soils but was unaffected by the contemporary N. In maize soils, legacy and contemporary N did not significantly affect N2O emissions, but cumulative CO2 emissions and amoA gene abundance significantly increased. The abundances of norB genes were not significantly influenced by either legacy fertilization or contemporary N amendments in either soil. Our findings demonstrate the greater importance of fertilization history over contemporary N in mediating soil N2O emissions, particularly for perennial bioenergy crops.

AB Willow coppice, energy maize and Miscanthus were evaluated regarding their soil-derived trace gas emission potential involving a nonfertilized and a crop-adapted slow-release nitrogen (N) fertilizer scheme. The N application rate was 80 kg N ha-1 yr-1 for the perennial crops and 240 kg N ha-1 yr-1 for the annual maize. A replicated field experiment was conducted with 1-year measurements of soil fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O in weekly intervals using static chambers. The measurements revealed a clear seasonal trend in soil CO2 emissions, with highest emissions being found for the N-fertilized Miscanthus plots (annual mean: 50 mg C m-(2) h-1). Significant differences between the cropping systems were found in soil N2O emissions due to their dependency on amount and timing of N fertilization. N-fertilized maize plots had highest N2O emissions by far, which accumulated to 3.6 kg N2O ha-1 yr-1. The contribution of CH4 fluxes to the total soil greenhouse gas subsumption was very small compared with N2O and CO2. CH4 fluxes were mostly negative indicating that the investigated soils mainly acted as weak sinks for atmospheric CH4. To identify the system providing the best ratio of yield to soil N2O emissions, a subsumption relative to biomass yields was calculated. N-fertilized maize caused the highest soil N2O emissions relative to dry matter yields. Moreover, unfertilized maize had higher relative soil N2O emissions than unfertilized Miscanthus and willow. These results favour perennial crops for bioenergy production, as they are able to provide high yields with low N2O emissions in the field.

AB Rainfed agriculture is one of the most common farming practices in the world and is vulnerable to global climate change. However, only limited studies have been conducted on rainfed agriculture, mainly using low-frequency manual techniques, which caused large uncertainties in estimating annual N2O emissions. In this study, we used a fully automated system to continuously measure soil N2O emissions for two years (April 2017 to March 2019) in a typical rainfed maize field in Northeast China. The annual N2O emissions were 2.8 kg N ha(-1) in year 1 (April 2017 to March 2018) and 1.8 kg N ha(-1) in year 2 (April 2018 to March 2019), accounting for 1.9 and 1.2% of the nitrogen fertilizer applied, respectively. The inter-annual variability was mainly due to different weather conditions encountered in years 1 and 2. A severe drought in year 1 reduced plant N uptake, leaving high mineral N in the soil, and the following moderate rainfalls promoted a large amount of N2O emissions. The seasonal pattern of N2O fluxes was mainly controlled by soil temperature and soil nitrate concentration. Both soil moisture and the molar ratio of NO/N2O indicate that N2O and NO were mainly derived from nitrification, resulting in a significant positive correlation between N2O and NO flux in the intra-rows (where nitrogen fertilizer was applied). Moreover, we observed that the N2O emissions during the freeze-thaw periods were negligible in this region for rainfed agriculture. Our long-term and high-resolution measurements of soil N2O emissions suggest that sampling between LST 9:00 and 10:00 is the best empirical sampling time for the intermittent manual measurements.

AB It is typically assumed that the dependence of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions on soil nitrogen (N) availability is best quantified in terms of ammonium (NH4+) and/or nitrate (NO3-) concentrations. In contrast, nitrite (NO2-) is seldom measured separately from NO3- despite its role as a central substrate in N2O production. We examined the effects of three N fertilizer sources and two placement methods on N2O and N dynamics in maize over two growing seasons. Cumulative N2O emissions were well-correlated with NO2- intensity (NO21) but not with NO3- (NO3I) or NH4+ (NH4I) intensity. By itself, NO21 explained more than 44% of the overall variance in N2O. Treatment effects on N2O and NO21 were similar. When conventional urea (U) was applied using mid-row banding (MRB), both N2O and NO21 increased by a factor of about 2 compared to broadcast/incorporated (BI). When polymer-coated urea (PCU) was the N source, MRB placement increased both N2O and NO21 compared to BI only in the wetter of the two years. When urea with microbial inhibitors (IU) was the N source, N2O and NO21 were lowest across both years and were less affected by placement than U or PCU. A 50/50 mix of IU and U reduced N2O and NO21 compared to U alone, suggesting that a mixed N source may provide an economical N2O mitigation strategy. Our results show that practices which reduce NO accumulation have the potential to also reduce N2O emissions, and that separate consideration of NO3- and NO dynamics can provide more insight than their combined dynamics as typically quantified.

AB Earthworms can increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, particularly in no-tillage systems where earthworms are abundant. Here, we study the effect of residue incorporation depth on earthworm-induced N2O emissions. We hypothesized that cumulative N2O emissions decrease with residue incorporation depth, because (i) increased water filled pore space (WFPS) in deeper soil layers leads to higher denitrification rates as well as more complete denitrification; and (ii) the longer upward diffusion path increases N2O reduction to N2. Two 84-day laboratory mesocosm experiments were conducted. First, we manually incorporated maize (Zea mays L.) residue at different soil depths (incorporation experiment). Second, 13C-enriched maize residue was applied to the soil surface and anecic species Lumbricus terrestris (L.) and epigeic species Lumbricus rubellus (Hoffmeister) were confined to different soil depths (earthworm experiment). Residue incorporation depth affected cumulative N2O emissions in both experiments (P similar to<similar to 0.001). In the incorporation experiment, N2O emissions decreased from 4.91 similar to mg similar to N2ON similar to kg-1 soil (surface application) to 2.71 similar to mg similar to N2ON similar to kg-1 soil (4050 similar to cm incorporation). In the earthworm experiment, N2O emissions from L. terrestris decreased from 3.87 similar to mg similar to N2ON similar to kg-1 soil (confined to 010 similar to cm) to 2.01 similar to mg similar to N2ON similar to kg-1 soil (confined to 030 similar to cm). Both experimental setups resulted in dissimilar WFPS profiles that affected N2O dynamics. We also found significant differences in residue C recovery in soil organic matter between L. terrestris (2841%) and L. rubellus (56%). We conclude that (i) N2O emissions decrease with residue incorporation depth, although this effect was complicated by dissimilar WFPS profiles; and (ii) larger residue C incorporation by L. rubellus than L. terrestris indicates that earthworm species differ in their C stabilization potential. Our findings underline the importance of studying earthworm diversity in the context of greenhouse gas emissions from agro-ecosystems.

AB In recent decades, climate change induced by enhanced global warming is one of the biggest challenges at the global level. Agriculture sectors significantly contribute to total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission to the atmosphere. Wheat and maize, cultivated globally, and consumed in different forms, are considered as crucial staple cereal for ensuring food security to global population. The management practices involving land preparation, sowing, fertilizer application, irrigation, pest management, etc. significantly influence the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from agricultural soil. In this study, CO2 and N2O emission were assessed from maize and wheat crops at four different levels of N fertilizer using cool farm tool model. Emissions of CO2 per hectare varied from 331.4 to 1,088.3 kgCO(2) in maize and ranged from 292.3 to 765.3 kgCO(2) in wheat on application of different doses of N. The total GHG emission in maize crops ranged from 859.5 to 3,003.4 kgCO(2) eq per hectare with the application of nitrogen at varying levels (0-240 kg N per hectare). The highest N2O efflux (0.368 kg per ton) was observed at 240 kg N per hectare under wheat crop. The total on-farm emissions, through fertilizer production, account for about 33.7%, and emission of N2O contributes only 65.9%, whereas pesticides account merely 0.4% under maize-wheat cropping. This study confirms that the direct emission of N2O was totally dependent on N fertilizers application rate; however, the indirect emission was controlled by the fuels and energy consumption.</p>

AB A net negative emissions technology is the transformation of CO2 and its storage in agricultural soils in form of soil organic carbon (SOC). One possibility to increase SOC stocks in agriculture is to grow and incorporate cover crops in the upper soil layer. However, incorporation of fresh plant material can also increase N2O emissions and thereby reduce the overall greenhouse gas mitigation effect. While the effect of removing plant material is relatively well understood, the effect of different incorporation methods and the inoculation of cover crops with microbial inoculant (MI) is still poorly known. To investigate these effects, we conducted an incubation study and a field trial where a grass-clover cover crop was followed by maize. We measured greenhouse gas emissions (N2O, CO2), soil parameters (Nmin, DOC, soil moisture and temperature), soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and maize yield. In the four weeks following cover crop incorporation, shallow rotary tillage induced 30 % higher CO2 emissions than ploughing and removal of cover crop biomass resulted in significantly lower N2O and CO2 emissions as if it was mulched and inoculated with MI. Regarding the whole season, removal of aboveground cover crop biomass reduced N2O field emissions in tendency by 21 %, whereby the trend in N2O reduction by adding MI in the field was less pronounced. Total N2O emissions did not differ between tillage implements used for incorporation. SOC stocks did not change within 0-20 cm within a year. Maize yield was 23 % higher with ploughing than rotary tillage. Overall, the addition of MI during cover crop incorporation might improve the greenhouse gas balance, but potential effects are superimposed too strongly by other management and meteorological factors. Therefore, claims that MI are an option to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture remain weakly substantiated.

AB Requirements for mitigation of the continued increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are much needed for the North China Plain (NCP). We conducted a meta-analysis of 76 published studies of 24 sites in the NCP to examine the effects of natural conditions and farming practices on GHG emissions in that region. We found that N2O was the main component of the area-scaled total GHG balance, and the CH4 contribution was <5%. Precipitation, temperature, soil pH, and texture had no significant impacts on annual GHG emissions, because of limited variation of these factors in the NCP. The N2O emissions increased exponentially with mineral fertilizer N application rate, with y=0.2389e(0.0058x) for wheat season and y=0.365e(0.0071x) for maize season. Emission factors were estimated at 0.37% for wheat and 0.90% for maize at conventional fertilizer N application rates. The agronomic optimal N rates (241 and 185kgNha(-1) for wheat and maize, respectively) exhibited great potential for reducing N2O emissions, by 0.39 (29%) and 1.71 (56%)kgN(2)O-Nha(-1)season(-1) for the wheat and maize seasons, respectively. Mixed application of organic manure with reduced mineral fertilizer N could reduce annual N2O emissions by 16% relative to mineral N application alone while maintaining a high crop yield. Compared with conventional tillage, no-tillage significantly reduced N2O emissions by 30% in the wheat season, whereas it increased those emissions by 10% in the maize season. This may have resulted from the lower soil temperature in winter and increased soil moisture in summer under no-tillage practice. Straw incorporation significantly increased annual N2O emissions, by 26% relative to straw removal. Our analysis indicates that these farming practices could be further tested to mitigate GHG emission and maintain high crop yields in the NCP.

AB Field studies that have investigated the effects of char materials on the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) are still scarce. Therefore, we conducted a field trial with bio- and hydrochars and measured N2O emissions for one whole year. It was hypothesised that the incorporation of chars reduces the emissions of N2O. Chars were produced by pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) using either maize silage or wood residues as feedstock. In addition, after production chars were post-treated with digestate in order to accelerate the ageing process of the chars. Chars and digestate were applied to the soil to raise the C content. Emissions of N2O were measured weekly and soil samples for inorganic nitrogen (N) and soil water-content were taken once a month. Additionally, the abundance of functional marker genes from denitrification (nosZ) was determined in October 2012 and in June 2013. The treatment with pure digestate emitted the most N2O compared to the control and char treatments. However, this was significant only in one case. There were no great differences between the char treatments due to high spatial variability and gene abundance of nosZ did not differ between treatments. Overall, emissions of N2O were relatively low. This was attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of the chars and the sandy soils that did not favour the production of N2O. To conclude, the emissions of N2O were mainly influenced by temperature and precipitation and to a minor extent by the type of char and post-treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and major contributor to climate change, is primarily released through agricultural activities. To better understand and quantify how land management practices, local climate conditions, and soil physicochemical properties affect these agricultural N2O emissions, we conducted a review of the peer-reviewed literature on N2O emission from corn [Zea mays L.] and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] fields. We evaluated the seasonal, cumulative effects of three nitrogen fertilizer rates-no fertilizer (0), low (<188 kg N ha(-1)), and high (188-400 kg N ha(-1))-tillage practices, local climate (precipitation and temperature), soil texture, and soil pH on soil N2O emissions. This meta-analysis included 77 articles for corn and 22 articles for soybean fields. Average N2O emissions during the corn rotation were 2.34 and 2.45 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1) under low and high N fertilizer rates, respectively, and were both substantially (p < 0.0001) greater than those of non-fertilized corn fields (0.91 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1)). Non-fertilized soybean fields showed seasonal N2O emissions of 0.74 kg N2O-N ha(-1), while low fertilizer application triggered a sharp increase (1.87 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) in N2O emissions by roughly 2.5 times (p < 0.028). Increased temperature did not significantly (p > 0.05) affect the emission of N2O from fertilized or non-fertilized corn fields. Regardless of fertilization and tillage practices, our analysis, including Principal Component Analysis, revealed that in corn fields, precipitation and soil pH are the dominant factors influencing soil N2O emissions. This study uniquely quantifies the influence of climate-soil factors, such as precipitation and soil pH, alongside agronomic practices, on N2O emissions, offering new insights beyond previous reviews focused primarily on fertilizer rates or tillage effects.

AB Intensive double cropping in the North China Plain has been challenged by serious environmental problems. Crop rotation is one of the important strategies for sustainable agriculture, which can reduce production risk and environmental impact. Yet, few studies have assessed enhanced crop rotation diversity on GHG emissions in the North China Plain. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and yields were measured from four cropping systems: (1) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) double cropping (WM); (2) peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and WM rotation (PWM); (3) ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), peanut and WM rotation (RCPWM); and (4) continuous cotton (C), to determine if enhanced crop rotation diversity can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve yields. The RCPWM, PWM and WM cropping system produced 11.9%, 15.7% and 32.4% higher net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), respectively, than the C cropping system each year by the soil-based method assessing the field productive process. From 2017 to 2018, in the same crop planting seasons, RCPWM had lower cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions, and produced similar peanut, wheat, and maize yields when compared to PWM. In 2018, PWM had higher cumulative N2O than WM during the wheat period, and they had similar seasonal cumulative N2O emissions during the maize period. Meanwhile, PWM produced lower cumulative CO2 emissions and higher wheat and maize yields. In 2019, RCPWM did not have significantly different seasonal cumulative N2O emissions and yield, but slightly higher soil CO2 emissions than C during the cotton season. The GHG emission intensity (GHGI) of the same crops was lower in RCPWM than in PWM during the peanut, wheat, and maize period or slightly higher than in the C treatment during cotton period. The results demonstrate that RCPWM could reduce soil N2O emissions when the same crops in PWM were compared due to less soil CO2 emissions that the previous cotton brought about. The RCPWM system did not show a lower soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate than the PWM and C systems. Therefore, increasing cotton into the peanut and wheat-maize rotation system (RCPWM) for more diversified system can help reduce soil GHG emissions without sacrificing yields.

AB Cover crops and in-season nitrogen (N) management are promoted as key conservation practices for reducing nitrate leaching losses from agricultural fields. However, their combined effects on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions per unit of crop productivity remains uncertain. These practices might contribute to high N2O emissions by providing N and C substrates for microbial denitrification activity, especially when in-season N application coincides with cover crop decomposition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of N application timing and cereal rye (CR, Secale cereale L) cover crops on area-and yield-scaled soil N2O emissions in continuous maize (Zea mays L.) over 3-yr (2018-2020). Treatments were: Pre-Season-N: 224 kg N ha-1 split applied in fall + pre-plant in 2018, or as single pre-plant applications in 2019 and 2020; In-Season-N: pre-plant + side-dress (growth stage V6-V7); In-Season-N + CR: ; and a zero N plot as the Control. We found that shifting from pre-season to in-season split N application did not significantly affect area-or yield-scaled N2O emissions in any year. Despite high N2O spikes for the In-Season-N + CR following side-dress N application in all years, this did not translate to consistently higher cumulative N2O emissions. Compared with Pre-Season-N and In-Season N, In-Season-N + CR significantly increased area-and yield-scaled N2O emissions by approximately 50% in 1 of 3 years. These results suggest the combination of high soil N supply, warm and wet soil conditions, and cover crop decomposition contributes to elevated N2O emissions, but the cumulative effects of side-dress N application with a CR cover crop are variable across years. With increasing adoption of these practices to reduce nitrate leaching losses from croplands, future work should simultaneously assess effects on N2O emissions and crop yield to account for potential tradeoffs in N loss pathways.

AB A high soil nitrogen (N) content in irrigated areas quite often results in environmental problems. Improving the management practices of intensive agriculture can mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study compared the effect of maize stover incorporation or removal together with different mineral N fertilizer rates (0, 200 and 300 kg N ha(-1)) on the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) on a sprinkler-irrigated maize (Zea mays L.). The trail was conducted in the Ebro Valley (NE Spain) in a high nitrate-N soil (i.e. 200 g NO3-N kg(-1)). Nitrous oxide and CO2 emissions were sampled weekly using a semistatic closed chamber and quantified using the photoacoustic technique in 2011 and 2012. Applying sidedress N fertilizer tended to increase N2O emissions whereas stover incorporation did not have any clear effect. Nitrification was probably the main process leading to N2O. Denitrification was limited by the low soil moisture content (WFPS < 54%), due to an adequate irrigation management. Emissions ranged from -0.11 to 0.36% of the N applied, below the IPCC (2007) values. Nitrogen fertilization tended to reduce CO2 emission, but only in 2011. Stover incorporation increased CO2 emission. Nitrogen use efficiency decreased with increasing mineral fertilizer supply. The application of N in high N soils of the Ebro Valley is not necessary until the soil restores a normal mineral N content, regardless of stover management. This will combine productivity with keeping N2O and CO2 emissions under control provided irrigation is adequately managed. Testing soil NO3--N contents before fertilizing would improve N fertilizer recommendations.

AB Green manure is widely employed to substitute chemical N fertilizer. However, the potential of further alleviating N2O emission when combined with efficient management technologies has not been fully explored. To reduce this research gap, a 2-year field experiment was conducted in northwestern China. The aim was to investigate the impact of zeolite application on N2O emission in the maize-common vetch intercropping system under 30% N reduction, as well as the possible mechanisms. The experiment included two cropping systems, namely monoculture maize and maize-common vetch intercropping, along with three amendment practices, namely conventional N, 70% conventional N, and zeolite application under 70% conventional N. Compared with monoculture maize under conventional N, maize-green manure intercropping combined with zeolite application under 70% chemical N achieved comparable yields. Simultaneously, this practice reduced cumulative N2O and yield-scaled N2O emissions by 36.9% and 39.2%, respectively. This reduction can be attributed to a decrease in soil ammonium-N by 20.9%-57.7%, nitrate-N by 47.7%-51.3%, nitrate reductase activities by 25.3%-34.4% and N2O-producer (i.e., nirS and nirK) abundance by 17.3%-79.4% in denitrification, and an increase in the N2O-reducer (i.e., nosZ) abundance by 40.0%-103.4%. Compared with 100% N input, 70% chemical N treatment reduced ammonium-N by 22.3%-41.0%, nitrate-N by 25.4%-41.0%, and N2O-producer abundance by 17.1%-35.0% in denitrification. Zeolite application reduced denitrifying enzyme activities by 8.2%-12.9%, N2O-producer abundance by 42.5%-56.4%, but increased N2O-reducer abundance by 13.3%-23.3% in denitrification. PLS-PM analysis showed that N2O emission mitigation was mainly related to reduced soil ammonium-N and nitrate-N, decreased N2O-producer abundance, and increased N2O-reducer abundance in denitrification. These findings provide new insights into the fact that intercropping green manure combined with zeolite application effectively mitigates N2O emission by regulating mineral N, N-cycling enzymes, and denitrifier abundances while maintaining maize yield after cutting 30% N input.

TI Maize-Brachiaria intercropping: A strategy to supply recycled N to maize

AB Nitrogen use in agriculture directly impacts food security, global warming, and environmental degradation. Forage grasses intercropped with maize produce feed for animals and or mulch for no-till systems. Forage grasses may exude nitrification inhibitors. It was hypothesized that brachiaria intercropping increases N recycling and maize grain yield and reduces nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil under maize cropping. A field experiment was set up in December 2016 to test three cropping system (maize monocropped, maize intercropped with Brachiaria brizantha or with B. humidicola) and two N rates (0 or 150 kg ha-1). The grasses were sown with maize, but B. humidicola did not germinate well in the first year. B. brizantha developed slowly during the maize cycle because of shading but expanded after maize was harvested. The experiment was repeated in 2017/2018 when B. humidicola was replanted. N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, maize grain yield and N content were measured during the two seasons. After the first maize harvest, the above- and below-ground biomass, C and N content of B. brizantha grown during fall-winter, and the biological nitrification inhibition potential of B. brizantha were evaluated. Maize yield responded to N fertilization (5.1 vs. 9.8 t ha-1) but not to brachiaria intercropping. B. brizantha recycled approximately 140 kg N ha-1 and left 12 t dry matter ha-1 for the second maize crop. However, the 2017/18 maize yields were not affected by the N recycled by B. brizantha, whereas N2O emissions were higher in the plots with brachiaria, suggesting that part of the recycled N was released too early after desiccation. Brachiarias showed no evidence of causing nitrification inhibition. The strategy of intercropping brachiarias did not increase maize yield, although it added C and recycled N in the system.

AB Conservation tillage is widely used in farmland management for soil carbon sequestration, but it can also lead to potential emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). Therefore, our study is aimed to investigate the effects of 15 years of no-tillage combined with four straw mulching levels of 0 % (NT0), 33 % (NT33), 67 % (NT67), and 100 % (NT100) compared to ridge tillage (RT) on the rates of N2O and N-2 emissions and the respective contributions of four microbial pathways to N2O emissions. The incubation experiments were conducted at two different moisture levels (55 % and 100 % WFPS) by using dicyandiamide inhibition and N-15-labeling techniques. Soil samples were collected from the 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil depths across three maize growth stages: seedling, jointing, and maturity. Our results showed that conservation tillage significantly decreased the N2O + N-2 emission at 55 % WFPS, but it has a reverse influence in N2O + N-2 emission at 100 % WFPS. The proportion of N2O in gaseous N loss were higher at 100 % WFPS than at 55 % WFPS. Among the four microbial pathways for N2O emissions, autotrophic nitrification was the dominant pathway 55 %WFPS. The contribution of autotrophic nitrification remarkably decreased, co-denitrification and denitrification increased at 100 %WFPS. Overall, at 100 % WFPS, N2O emissions from all major microbial pathways were positively correlated with GWC, temperature, TC, TN, NH4+-N, and NO3--N, but negatively correlated with soil pH and C/N ratios. Our results suggest that long-term conservation tillage increases N2O and N-2 emissions from the soil under water-saturated conditions by regu-lating soil nutrient levels, soil moisture, and microbial pathways. Therefore, we should consider the impact of conservation tillage on N2O emission risk when we attach importance to the role of conservation tillage in improving soil quality and increasing crop yields.

AB It is unclear how deep-band fertilizer placement influences N2O emission and maize (Zea mays L.) yield, and the production and diffusion of N2O within the soil profile under deep-band fertilizer placement treatments. Thus, we conducted a field experiment in 2019-2020 with spring maize to study the effects of different fertilization depths of 5 cm (D5), 15 cm (D15), 25 cm (D25), and 35 cm (D35) on N2O emissions. The N2O concentration in the fertilized soil profile was measured to calculate the N2O diffusion and production rates, and the surface N2O emissions were measured simultaneously. The results showed that the availability of NO3--N in the soil was the main factor related to N2O production and emissions, and N2O emissions were strongly related to the production and diffusion of N2O in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Deep-band fertilizer placement significantly reduced surface N2O emissions, and the N2O production and diffusion rates in the 0-20 cm soil profile. The cumulative N2O diffusion in the 0-20 cm layer accounted for 79.2%, 73.7%, 58.2%, and 48.6% of those in 0-40 cm soil depth under D5, D15, D25, and D35, respectively. Compared with D5, D25 and D35 significantly reduced the N2O emissions by 30.8% and 59.3%, respectively, N2O-N emission factors by 41.6% and 80.0%, and yield-scaled N2O-N by 39.3% and 58.2%. D25 also increased the maize yield by 13.8% and obtained the highest nitrogen use efficiency (NUE, 43.6%), whereas D35 had negative effects on the maize yield and NUE. Therefore, deep-band fertilizer placement reduced the N2O production rate and diffusion flux in the near-surface soil layer by decreasing the NO3--N content in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Thus, the location where N2O was produced transferred to the deeper soil layer to reduce surface N2O emissions. The recommended fertilization depth of 25 cm can reduce N2O emissions and significantly enhance the maize yield, N uptake, biomass, and NUE.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are a major source of gaseous nitrogen loss, causing environmental pollution. The low organic content in the Loess Plateau region, coupled with the high fertilizer demand of maize, further exacerbates these N losses. N fertilizers play a primary role in N2O emissions by influencing soil denitrifying bacteria, however, the underlying microbial mechanisms that contribute to N2O emissions have not been fully explored. Therefore, the research aimed to gain insights into the intricate relationships between N fertilization, soil denitrification, N2O emissions, potential denitrification activity (PDA), and maize nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in semi-arid regions. Four nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates, namely N0, N1, N2, and N3 (representing 0, 100, 200, and 300 kg ha(-1) yr.(-1), respectively) were applied to maize field. The cumulative N2O emissions were 32 and 33% higher under N2 and 37 and 39% higher under N3 in the 2020 and 2021, respectively, than the N0 treatment. N fertilization rates impacted the abundance, composition, and network of soil denitrifying communities (nirS and nosZ) in the bulk and rhizosphere soil. Additionally, within the nirS community, the genera Cupriavidus and Rhodanobacter were associated with N2O emissions. Conversely, in the nosZ denitrifier, the genera Azospirillum, Mesorhizobium, and Microvirga in the bulk and rhizosphere soil reduced N2O emissions. Further analysis using both random forest and structural equation model (SEM) revealed that specific soil properties (pH, NO3--N, SOC, SWC, and DON), and the presence of nirS-harboring denitrification, were positively associated with PDA activities, respectively, and exhibited a significant association to N2O emissions and PDA activities but expressed a negative effect on maize NUE. However, nosZ-harboring denitrification showed an opposite trend, suggesting different effects on these variables. Our findings suggest that N fertilization promoted microbial growth and N2O emissions by increasing the abundance of nirS and nosZ denitrifiers and altering the composition of their communities. This study provides new insights into the relationships among soil microbiome, maize productivity, NUE, and soil N2O emissions in semi-arid regions.

AB Straw return can improve crop yield as well as soil organic carbon (SOC) but may raise the possibility of N2O and CH4 emissions. However, few studies have compared the effects of straw return on the yield, SOC, and N2O emissions of various crops. Which management strategies are the best for balancing yield, SOC, and emission reduction for various crops needs to be clarified. A meta-analysis containing 2269 datasets collected from 369 studies was conducted to investigate the influence of agricultural management strategies on yield increase, soil carbon sequestration, and emission reduction in various crops after the straw return. Analytical results indicated that, on average, straw return increased the yield of rice, wheat, and maize by 5.04%, 8.09%, and 8.71%, respectively. Straw return increased maize N2O emissions by 14.69% but did not significantly affect wheat N2O emissions. Interestingly, straw return reduced the rice N2O emissions by 11.43% but increased the CH4 emissions by 72.01%. The recommended nitrogen application amounts for balancing yield, SOC, and emission reduction varied among the three crops, while the recommended straw return amounts were more than 9000 kg/ha. The optimal tillage and straw return strategies for rice, wheat, and maize were plow tillage combined with incor-poration, rotary tillage combined with incorporation, and no-tillage combined with mulching, respectively. A straw return duration of 5-10 years for rice and maize and <= 5 years for wheat was recommended. These findings provide optimal agricultural management strategies after straw return to balance the crop yield, SOC, and emission reduction for China's three major grain crops.

AB Crop straw application in combination with fertilizer nitrogen (N) dose reduction is recommended to improve crop yields and carbon sequestration in soil. This practice may also promote soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, thus partially counterbalancing the expected benefits. However, the full straw return effect on the reduction of soil N2O to dinitrogen (N2) is not yet well known, owing to the methodological difficulties in quantifying soil N2 fluxes against the high atmospheric N2 concentration. This study was carried out in a long-term experimental field of a calcareous soil cultivated with summer maize and winter wheat in rotation. For the three field treatments since 2006, i.e., optimal fertilizer N with and without full straw return, and the control (without N and straw application), we conducted in- or ex-situ observations on field N2O fluxes, soil N2 emissions, crop yields, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and soil/environmental factors. During a rotation cycle, we found that soil ammonium and nitrite concentrations, moisture and temperature jointly determined the N2O emissions, while nitrate concentration, dissolvable organic carbon to nitrate-N ratio and moisture jointly dominated the N2 emissions. Compared to straw removal, the straw return promoted reduction of more soil N2O to N2 in the wheat season than in the maize season, showing increases in the N2 emissions by 57% versus - 10% (P = 0.06). Nevertheless, it significantly enhanced the N2O emissions measured in situ by approximately 137% and 21% in the wheat and maize seasons, respectively (P < 0.05). It also significantly increased the annual crop yields by 20% on average (P < 0.05). Meanwhile it tended to enhance the SOC stock (0-20 cm) by 15 parts per thousand yr- 1 (P = 0.14), showing a trend of more intensive carbon sequestration than the direct soil N2O emission (-948 versus 378 kg CO2e ha- 1 yr- 1 on average). We conclude that the long-term full straw return helps to sequester more carbon that offsetting the enhanced N2O emissions from the calcareous soil in the rotation system as it promotes reduction of more N2O to N2 in the wheat season.

AB BACKGROUND: Relay intercropping of maize and soybean can improve land productivity. However, the mechanism behind N2O emissions in this practice remains unclear. A two-factor randomized block field trial was conducted to reveal the mechanism of N2O emissions in a full additive maize-soybean relay intercropping. Factor A was three cropping systems - that is, monoculture maize (Zea mays L.), monoculture soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) and maize-soybean relay intercropping. Factor B was different N supply, containing no N, reduced N and conventional N. Differences in N2O emissions, soil properties, rhizosphere bacterial communities and yield advantage were evaluated.
   RESULTS: The land equivalent ratio was 1.55-2.44, and the cumulative N2O emission (CEN2O) was notably lower by 60.2% in intercropping than in monoculture, respectively. Reduced N declined CEN2O without penalty on the yield advantages. The relay intercropping shifted soil properties - for example, soil organic matter, total N, NH4+ and protease activity - and improved the soil microorganism community - for example, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Intercropping reduced CEN2O by directly suppressing nirS- and amoA-regulated N2O generation during soil N cycling, or nirS- and amoA-mediated soil properties shifted to reduce CEN2O indirectly. Reduced N directly reduced CEN2O by decreasing soil N content and reducing soil microorganism activities to alleviate N2O produced in soil N cycling.
   CONCLUSION: Conducting a full additive maize-soybean relay intercropping with reduced nitrogen supply provides a way to alleviate N2O emissions without the penalty on the yield advantage by changing rhizosphere bacterial communities and soil N cycling.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the most important greenhouse gases emitted from fertilized agricultural soils. Vegetable fields, mostly managed under intensive mode with higher rate nitrogen application, frequent irrigation, and multiple planting-harvest cycles, does contribute to national GHG inventory greatly due to the increasing planting area in China. N2O emissions from four different fields a maize field (maize), a newly established open-ground vegetable field converted from a maize field four years earlier (OV4), an established open-ground vegetable field converted from a maize field more than 20 years ago (OV20), and an established sunlight heated greenhouse vegetable field converted from a maize field more than 20 years ago (GV20) with four different fertilization treatments for the OV4 field were measured using the closed chamber method between March 15th, 2012 and March 14th, 2013 in suburban area of Beijing, North China Plain. Results showed that the annual N2O emissions from vegetable fields were 3.1-4.6 times higher than the typical maize field. All the N2O emission peaks were occurred after fertilization and the fertilization associated emissions accounted for 81.1% (ranging from 77.0% to 87.2%) of the annual N2O emission with 22.2% time duration in the whole year for vegetable fields. Both the occurrence data and duration of N2O emission peaks were associated with N input type (chemical or manure) and the application rate. The N2O emission peaks appeared earlier (on the 3rd day after application) and lasted shorter when only chemical N was applied; while they appeared later (on the 7th to 10th day after application) and lasted longer when the combination of manure and chemical N were applied. The magnitudes of N2O emission peaks increased when the N application rate was higher. Dicyandiamide (DCD) decreased N2O emissions by 30.1% and 21.1% in the spring cucumber and autumn cabbage seasons respectively (averaged of 24.7% over the whole year). Calculations showed that it is critical to estimate the emission factor (EF) by N type in order to decrease the uncertainty of regional N2O emissions when using EF as calculation method. EFs were 0.20% and 0.42% for manure N in the cucumber and cabbage seasons respectively; and were 0.55-1.30% and 0.8-1.59% for chemical N in the cucumber and cabbage seasons respectively.

AB The influence of inorganic fertilizer and compost on background nitrous oxide (N2O) and fertilizer-induced N2O emissions were examined over a maize-wheat rotation year from June 2008 to May 2009 in a fluvo-aquic soil in Henan Province of China where a field experiment had been established in 1989 to evaluate the long-term effects of manure and fertilizer on soil organic status. The study involved five treatments: compost (OM), fertilizer NPK (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium, NPK), half compost N plus half fertilizer N (HUM), fertilizer NK (NK), and control without any fertilizer (CK). The natural logarithms of the background N2O fluxes were significantly (P<0.05) correlated with soil temperature, but not with soil moisture, during the maize or wheat growing season. The 18-year application of compost alone and inorganic fertilizer not only significantly (P<0.05) increased soil organic carbon (SOC) by 152% and 10-43% (respectively), but also increased background N2O emissions by 106% and 48-76% (respectively) compared with the control. Total N in soils was a better indicator for predicting annual background N2O emission than SOC. The estimated emission factor (EF) of mineralized N, calculated by dividing annual N2O emission by mineralized N was 0.13-0.19%, significantly (P<0.05) lower than the EF of added N (0.30-0.39%). The annual N2O emission in the NPK, HUM and OM soils amended with 300 kg ha(-1) organic or inorganic N was 1427, 1325 and 1178 g N ha(-1), respectively. There was a significant (P<0.05) difference between the NPK and OM. The results of this study indicate that soil indigenous N was less efficiently converted into N2O compared with exogenous N. Increasing SOC by compost application, then partially increasing N supply to crops instead of adding inorganic N fertilizer, may be an effective measure to mitigate N2O emissions from arable soils in the North China plain.

AB Large fertilizer nitrogen (N) input has created favorable conditions for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in semi-arid areas. However, it remains to be determined whether the major contradictions between high yield and N2O emissions reduction can be reconciled by matching fertilization with water availability. A 3-year field experiment was conducted in the Loess Plateau of northwest China, monitored N2O fluxes over five N application rates (0, 120, 175, 230, and 285 kg N ha(-1)), and examined the environmental factors and crop production in a rainfed maize field. Results showed that available soil water storage at sowing (ASWS) is crucial in promoting soil N2O emissions by altering soil NO3--N, organic C, and organic N availability in semi-arid agroecosystems. The cumulative N2O emissions exponentially increased with increasing N rates. However, the cumulative N2O emissions were moderately low (1.20 kg N ha(-1)) at the N application rate of 230 kg ha(-1), where maize yield was maximized, after which N2O emissions remarkably increased by 27.88 %. This result suggests that reduced N application to levels satisfying crop needs could significantly reduce N2O emissions with a minor yield penalty. Furthermore, water availability determines the absorption and utilization of nutrients by crops on the Loess Plateau and ultimately determines grain yield. Therefore, an N2O emission-yield curve was established to determine whether the target crop yield could be obtained by adjusting water availability and N fertilization rates while reducing N2O emissions. Our results suggest that N application rates at 218.7-230.0 kg ha(-1), ensuring ASWS at 209.5-215.2 mm at sowing and precipitation within 61-90 days after sowing at 184.2-194.0 mm is ideal for matching fertilization with water availability to balancing high yield and mitigating N2O emissions in the study region.

AB We investigated how amending maize with wastewater at 120 kg N ha(-1) affected crop growth, soil characteristics and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) compared to plants fertilized with urea. Maize growth response was similar when fertilized with urea or wastewater despite a delayed release of nutrients upon mineralization of the organic material in the wastewater. Applying wastewater to soil significantly increased the mean CO2 emission rate 2.4 times to 1.74 A mu g C kg(-1) soil h(-1) compared to the unamended soil (0.74 A mu g C kg(-1) soil h(-1)), and cultivating maize further increased it 3.2 times (5.61 A mu g C kg(-1) soil h(-1)). Irrigating soil with wastewater, cultivating it with maize or applying urea had no significant effect on the emission of N2O compared to the unamended soil (1.49 x 10(-3) A mu g N kg(-1) soil h(-1)). Adding urea to soil did no affect the CH4 oxidation rate (0.1 x 10(-3) A mu g C kg(-1) soil h(-1)), nor did cultivating maize in the urea-amended soil, but adding wastewater to soil resulted in a significant production of CH4 (128.4 x 10(-3) A mu g C kg(-1) soil h(-1)). Irrigating soil with wastewater increased the global warming potential (GWP) 2.5 fold compared to the urea amended soil, while in soil cultivated with maize GWP increased 1.4 times. It was found that irrigating crops with wastewater might limit the use of N fertilizer and water from aquifers, but the amount applied should be limited because nitrate (NO (3) (-) ) leaching and emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 will be substantial and the increased soil salt content will limit crop growth.

AB Agricultural intensification offers potential to grow more food while reducing the conversion of native ecosystems to croplands. However, intensification also risks environmental degradation through emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrate leaching to ground and surface waters. Intensively-managed croplands and nitrogen (N) fertilizer use are expanding rapidly in tropical regions. We quantified fertilizer responses of maize yield, N2O emissions, and N leaching in an Amazon soybean-maize double-cropping system on deep, highly-weathered soils in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Application of N fertilizer above 80 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1) increased maize yield and N2O emissions only slightly. Unlike experiences in temperate regions, leached nitrate accumulated in deep soils with increased fertilizer and conversion to cropping at N fertilization rates >80 kg N ha(-1), which exceeded maize demand. This raises new questions about the capacity of tropical agricultural soils to store nitrogen, which may determine when and how much nitrogen impacts surface waters.

AB A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the combined or individual effects of biochar and nitrapyrin (a nitrification inhibitor) on N2O and NO emissions from a sandy loam soil cropped to maize. The study included nine treatments: addition of urea alone or combined with nitrapyrin to soils that had been amended with biochar at 0, 3, 6, and 12 t ha(-1) in the preceding year, and a control without the addition of N fertilizer. Peaks in N2O and NO flux occurred simultaneously following fertilizer application and intense rainfall events, and the peak of NO flux was much higher than that of N2O following application of basal fertilizer. Mean emission ratios of NO/N2O ranged from 1.11 to 1.72, suggesting that N2O was primarily derived from nitrification. Cumulative N2O and NO emissions were 1.00 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 1.39 kg NO-N ha(-1) in the N treatment, respectively, decreasing to 0.81-0.85 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 1.31-1.35 kg NO-N ha(-1) in the biochar amended soils, respectively, while there was no significant difference among the treatments. NO emissions were significantly lower in the nitrapyrin treatments than in the N fertilization-alone treatments (P < 0.05), but there was no effect on N2O emissions. Neither biochar nor nitrapyrin amendment affected maize yield or N uptake. Overall, our results showed that biochar amendment in the preceding year had little effect on N2O and NO emissions in the following year, while the nitrapyrin decreased NO, but not N2O emissions, probably due to suppression of denitrification caused by the low soil moisture content.

AB Biochar, included as a soil amendment by EU Regulation 2019/1009, has been shown to increase soil organic C stock and nutrient retention. We investigated the effect of biochar incorporation alone (B) and in association with mineral (BMin), digestate (BDig) and slurry (BSlu) fertilization, compared to the respective controls without biochar (C, Min, Dig and Slu), in a silage maize-Italian ryegrass rotation, on yield, soil fertility parameters and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Two types of biochar in three doses (0.2, 0.45, 0.9%) were tested in two cropping seasons. Biochar did not significantly affect maize yield; however, BDig tended to increase silage yield and the ear component compared to Dig, while BMin tended to reduce maize N uptake compared to Min. Biochar incorporation significantly increased soil organic C (+31%) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) (+13%) in all the fertilization treatments; BMin and BDig also showed an increase compared to biochar alone (B). Emission of N2O was mainly driven by fertilization, digestate exhibiting the highest emissions. Biochar addition decreased the cumulative N2O emissions consistently in all the fertilization treatments, though not significantly. The association of biochar with organic fertilizers, in particular digestate, appears promising in increasing the fertilizer efficiency and reducing N2O emissions.

AB Soil dinitrogen (N-2) emissions are a key nitrogen loss pathway of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the quantification of field N-2 emissions from terrestrial ecosystems remains challenging, as sensitive field methods for measuring N-2 fluxes are lacking. Here, we report a new approach to quantify field N-2 emissions by (i) param-eterizing the molar ratio of nitrous oxide (N2O) to N2O plus N-2 emissions (RN2O) in the laboratory and (ii) measuring field N2O emissions and soil factors. Soil samples were taken from a maize field and incubated in the laboratory under simulated field conditions. Soil N-2 and N2O emissions were determined using the gas-flow-soilcore method. The measurements revealed that the RN2O values were significantly higher (0.06-0.67) following urea fertilization and soil rewetting compared to those periods with no fertilization (0.03-0.08) (P < 0.01). A multivariate, nonlinear parameterization of RN z o against four easily measured soil factors (ammonia and nitrate concentrations, temperature, and moisture) (n = 20, r(2) = 0.92, P < 0.001) was developed. The seasonal N-2 emissions at the field scale were calculated by combining the laboratory-measured RN2O with the field-measured N2O emissions and the soil factors. Based on this approach, the cumulative emissions of N-2 and N-2 +N2O for the maize season were 7.2 +/- 2.8 and 9.6 +/- 2.1 (standard error) kg N ha(-1), respectively. Using a fixed RN2O, i.e., disregarding the temporal and spatial variability of RN2O, resulted in approximately 50%-70% lower estimates. Our study shows that a combination of field N2O and soil factors measurements and laboratory parameterization of RN2O allows field N-2 emissions from croplands to be constrained. With additional measurements, including other soil properties, the development of a generalized parameterization of RN2O may become feasible. This approach would allow for a better understanding of gaseous N losses from agricultural ecosystems.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of nitrification inhibitor (nitrapyrin; NI) as a mitigation option for yield-scaled emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) under tillage management and urea fertilization in the irrigated maize fields in northern Iran. A split-plot experiment was performed based on a randomized completed blocks design with three replicates. The main plots were the levels of tillage practices (conventional tillage (CT) and minimum tillage (MT), and the subplots were the fertilizer treatments (control, urea, and urea + NI). The gas samples for measuring N2O emissions were collected during the maize growing season from June to September, using opaque manual circular static chambers. Soil samples were taken at 0-10 cm to determine water-filled pore space, ammonium (NH4+), and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in the soil. When the crop reached physiological maturity, maize was harvested to measure grain yield, biomass production, N uptake of aboveground, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The results showed that the applying NI in combination with urea reduced the total N2O emissions by up to 58% and 64% in MT and CT, respectively. In the urea + NI treatment, mean soil concentrations of NH4+ and NO3- were significantly higher (20%) and lower (23.5%), respectively, compared with other treatments. The NI reduced the yield-scaled N2O-N emission up to 79% and 55% for CT and MT, respectively. Furthermore, compared to treatment with urea alone, the application of NI increased the NUE of the MT and CT systems by an average of 55% and 46%, respectively. This study emphasized that the application of nitrapyrin should be encouraged in irrigated maize fields, in order to minimize N2O emissions and improve NUE and biomass production.

AB The emission and mitigation of nitrous oxide (N2O) from high nitrogen (N) vegetable systems is not well understood. Nitrification inhibitors are widely used to decrease N2O emissions in many cropping systems. However, most N2O flux measurements and inhibitor impacts have been made with small chambers and have not been investigated at a paddock-scale using micrometeorological techniques. We quantified N2O fluxes over a four ha celery paddock using open-path Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy in conjunction with a backward Lagrangian stochastic model, in addition to using a closed chamber technique. The celery crop was grown on a sandy soil in southern Victoria, Australia. The emission of N2O was measured following the application of chicken manure and N fertilizer with and without the application of a nitrification inhibitor 3, 4-dimethyl pyrazole phosphate (DMPP). The two techniques consistently demonstrated that DMPP application reduced N2O emission by 37-44%, even though the N2O fluxes measured by a micrometeorological technique were more than 10 times higher than the small chamber measurements. The results suggest that nitrification inhibitors have the potential to mitigate N2O emission from intensive vegetable production systems, and that the national soil N2O emission inventory assessments and modelling predictions may vary with gas measurement techniques.

AB This study seeks to quantify the roles of soybean and corn plants and the cropland ecosystem in the regional N2O budget of the Upper Midwest, USA. The N2O flux was measured at three scales (plant, the soil-plant ecosystem, and region) using newly designed steady-state flow-through plant chambers, a flux-gradient micrometeorological tower, and continuous tall-tower observatories. Results indicate that the following. (1) N2O fluxes from unfertilized soybean (0.03 +/- 0.05 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) and fertilized corn plants (-0.01 +/- 0.04 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) were about one magnitude lower than N2O emissions from the soil-plant ecosystem (0.26 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for soybean and 0.95 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for corn), confirming that cropland N2O emissions were mainly from the soil. (2) Fertilization increased the corn plant flux for a short period (about 20 days), and late-season fertilization dramatically increased the soybean plant emissions. (3) The direct N2O emission from cropland accounted for less than 20 % of the regional flux, suggesting a significant influence by other sources and indirect emissions, in the regional N2O budget.

AB Cattle slurry is an important nitrogen source for maize on dairy farms. Slurry injection is an effective measure to reduce ammonia emissions after field application, but with higher risk of nitrous oxide emission than surface application. This study compared soil mineral nitrogen dynamics and nitrous oxide emissions with two ways of application. First, traditional injection at 25 cm spacing between rows followed by ploughing (called "non-placed slurry"), and second, injection using a new so-called goosefoot slurry injector that placed the slurry in ploughed soil as a 30 cm broad band at 10 cm depth below maize crop rows with 75 cm spacing (named "placed slurry"). Furthermore, the effect of treating slurry with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) in Vizura (R) was tested with both application methods. The field experiment was conducted on a sandy loam soil in a temperate climate. Both nitrous oxide emissions, and the dynamics of soil mineral nitrogen, were monitored for eight weeks after slurry application and seeding of maize using static chambers. The level of nitrous oxide emissions was higher with non-placed compared to placed slurry (p < 0.01), mainly due to higher emissions during the first four weeks. This might be due to higher rates of nitrification and in turn stimulation of denitrification. In both placed and non-placed slurry treatments, Vizura (R) caused higher soil ammonium concentrations and lower nitrate concentrations (p < 0.001), particularly from 3 to 8 weeks after slurry application. The final level of soil nitrate was similar with and without the nitrification inhibitor, but higher with placed compared to non-placed slurry. Adding Vizura (R) to non-placed slurry reduced nitrous oxide emissions by 70% when compared to untreated slurry. Surprisingly, there was a non-significant trend towards higher cumulative emissions from placed slurry with the nitrification inhibitor compared to untreated slurry, which was due to higher emissions in the last part of the monitoring period (5-7 weeks after slurry application). Possibly, degradation of the nitrification inhibitor and nitrification activity inside the slurry band as the soil dried promoted nitrous oxide emissions by this time. In summary, placement of untreated slurry in a broad band under maize seeds reduced nitrous oxide emissions compared to non-placed slurry with more soil contact. A comparable reduction was achieved by adding a nitrification inhibitor to non-placed slurry. The pattern of nitrous oxide emissions from placed slurry treated with the inhibitor was complex and requires more investigation. The emission of nitrous oxide was highest when nitrate accumulated in soil around decomposing cattle slurry, and mitigation strategies should aim to prevent this. This study demonstrated a potential for mitigation of nitrous oxide emission by placement of cattle slurry, which may be an alternative to the use of a nitrification inhibitor.

AB Sustainability of biogas production is strongly dependent on soil-borne greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during feedstock cultivation. Maize (Zea mays) is the most common feedstock for biogas production in Europe. Since it is an annual crop requiring high fertilizer input, maize cropping can cause high GHG emissions on sites that, due to their hydrology, have high N2O emission potential. On such sites, cultivation of cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) as a perennial crop could be a more environmentally friendly alternative offering versatile ecosystem services. To evaluate the possible benefits of perennial cup plant cropping on GHG emissions and nitrogen losses, an incubation study was conducted with intact soil cores from a maize field and a cup plant field. The N-15 gas flux method was used to quantify N source-specific N-2 and N2O fluxes. Cumulated N2O emissions and N-2+N2O emissions did not differ significantly between maize and cup plant soils, but tended to be higher in maize soil. Soils from both systems exhibited relatively high and similar N2O/(N-2+N2O) ratios (N(2)Oi). N2O emissions originating from sources other than the N-15-labelled NO3 pool were low, but were the only fluxes exhibiting a significant difference between the maize and cup plant soils. Missing differences in fluxes derived from the N-15 pool indicate that under the experimental conditions with high moisture and NO3- level, and without plants, the cropping system had little effect on N fluxes related to denitrification. Lower soil pH and higher bulk density in the cup plant soil are likely to have reduced the mitigation potential of perennial biomass cropping.

AB Context: Enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs) have provided opportunities for the simultaneous mitigation of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and increases in crop productions. However, the practice of combining EENFs with optimal fertilization under conditions of misaligned water and fertilizer inputs in rain-fed spring maize systems remains inadequately understood.
   Objective: This study aims to determine the factors controlling N2O emissions under the soil climatic conditions in rain-fed plastic mulching cropping systems treated with different nitrogen (N) fertilization rates and EENFs, and to determine the most effective N fertilization measure to reduce N2O emissions while maintaining crop yields.
   Methods: A 3-year field experiment was conducted in a spring maize system located in the semiarid rain-fed region of the Loess Plateau, applying two types of EENFs: a nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) and a slow-release fertilizer (SRF). It comprised five fertilization treatments: unfertilized (CK), conventional N rate (CON, 200 kg N ha(-1)), optimal N rate (OPT, 160 kg N ha(-1)), OPT with the addition of DCD (OPT+DCD), and OPT using SRF (OPT-SRF).
   Results: The average annual cumulative N2O emissions over the 3-year experimental period ranged from 0.74 to 1.87 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Fertilizer N contributed 26 60% to annual N2O emissions. The highest N2O fluxes (50-161 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) typically occurred within the initial 10 days following fertilization, likely induced by strong nitrification processes, constituting 12-19% of the annual N2O emissions during this brief period. In comparison to the CON treatment, the OPT, OPT+DCD, and OPT-SRF treatments resulted in significant reductions in annual N2O emissions of 24%, 46%, and 34%, respectively, without causing any significant decrease in maize grain yields. The application of DCD led to increased ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations while reducing nitrate (NO3--N). Conversely, using SRF resulted in a decrease in both NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations.
   Conclusions: Using EENFs at the ideal fertilization rate significantly curtailed yearly N2O emissions without adversely affecting maize yields in a rain-fed plastic mulching spring maize system prevalent in the Loess Plateau. Most N2O emissions occurred post-fertilization, with rainfall events further influencing these emissions.
   Implications: Our findings recommend the incorporation of nitrification inhibitors, such as DCD, as the most effective fertilizer measure for reducing N2O emissions in the rain-fed region of the Loess Plateau.

AB The use of zootechnical slurries in agriculture can increase N losses as N2O by direct emission and by denitrification, The aim of this research was to determine the influence of pig slurry, as well as its combination with mineral N, on N2O emissions in the field and their relationships with some fractions of soil organic matter, with soil moisture and with rainfall, In spite of varying amounts of organic substance applied, the diverse agronomic treatments did not produce substantial differences in N losses due to denitrification. Wide variations between the slurry fertilized and the urea-fertilized plots were not found, whereas the combination of pig slurry with urea usually produced an increase both in N2O emissions due to denitrification and in direct N2O emissions (N losses corresponding to about 50% of those due to denitrification). The greatest losses of N2O-N occurred in the first month following fertilizer administration. N2O emissions due to denitrification were highest in the days immediately following the administration of fertilizers and lowest in a later period. N2O emissions due to nitrification occurred later. Therefore, N2O emission via nitrification differed from N2O losses via denitrification which, under optimal conditions, presented peaks of activity during the whole growth cycle. The N2O-N losses were highly influenced by physical parameters, particularly rain. An increase in micropore water creates conditions of scarce oxygenation or of anaerobiosis which influence oxidation-reduction processes and, at the same time, can limit the diffusion of bacteria-produced gas towards the soil surface.

AB The emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), one of the main greenhouse gases, which contributes significantly to global warming, is a major challenge in modern agriculture. The effects of land use systems on N2O emissions are the result of multiple variables, whose interactions need to be better understood. In this sense, this study analyzed the possible effects of different soil managements, crop rotations and sequences, as well as edaphoclimatic factors causing N2O emissions from soils in the Cerrado biome (scrubland). The following four land-use systems were evaluated: 1) No-tillage cultivation with biennial crop rotations and sequences: legume-grass and alternating grass-legume crops in the second season - NT-SS/MP; 2) No-tillage with biennial rotations and sequences: grass-legume and alternating second crop of legume-grass - NT-MP/SS; 3) Conventional planting with disc harrow and biennial legume-grass rotation-CT-S/M; and 4) Native Cerrado (CE), no agricultural land use. The legume and grass species, planted in the two no-tillage treatments were soybean, followed by sorghum BRS3.32 (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) (SS), and maize, followed by pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) (MP). Nitrous oxide emissions were evaluated for 25 months (October 2013 to October 2015), and the results were grouped in annual, total, growing and non-growing seasons, as well as yield-scaled N2O emissions. The mean N2O fluxes were 24.14, 15.71, 32.49 and 1.87 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the NT-SS/MP, NT-MP/SS, CT-S/M and Cerrado areas respectively. Cumulative N2O fluxes over the total evaluation period from the systems NT-SS/MP, NT-MP/SS, CT-S/M and CE, respectively, were 3.47, 2.29, 4.87 and 0.26 kg ha(-1). A correlation between N2O fluxes and the environmental variables was observed, with the exception of water-filled pore space (WFPS), but N2O peaks were associated with WFPS values of >65%. In the 2014-2015 growing season, yield-scaled N2O emissions from NT-MP/SS were lower than from CT-S/M. A multi-factor approach indicated that conventional management with main season soybean or maize and no alternating crop sequence intensifies soil N2O emissions in the Cerrado.

AB We measured nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions during the snow-free season (April-November) over a 3-year period (1998-2000) from a Silandic Andosols Cultivated with maize (Zea mays L.) in central Hokkaido, Japan. In May, before furrowing, composted cattle manure was broadcast onto the field at a rate of 3.0 g N m(-2). After furrowing, chemical fertilizer (NH4)(2)SO4-N + (NH4)(3)PO4-N : urea-N at a ratio of 10:3 was applied to the row at a rate of 13 g N m(-2). An impermeable layer lay 1.3 in below ground level. As a result, after heavy rains and during the snow-melting period, the groundwater table rose to near the ground surface. The N2O and NO emission rates ranged from 0.0 to 6.4 and from 0.00 to 0.94 mg N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The highest N2O emission was observed after heavy rain in summer and autumn. The magnitude and seasonal pattern of N2O emissions from the inter row were similar to those from the row itself, although chemical fertilizer had not been applied to the inter row. In contrast, all increase in NO emissions was observed only from the row. Seasonal fluctuations ill Soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations and the emission ratio N2O-N/NO-N suggested that N2O and NO emitted after fertilizer application (May to early July) were produced mainly by nitrification, whereas N2O emitted after heavy rains (after mid-July) was produced mainly by derntrification. Total N2O and NO emissions during the snow-free season ranged from 0.7 to 2.8 and from 0.0 to 0.7 g N m(-2), respectively, over a 3-year period. The N2O and NO emissions from our field were relatively high compared with those reported worldwide. In contrast, reported N2O emission rates from agricultural Andosols in Japan are typically lower than those from other agricultural soils in Japan and around the world. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that high N2O emissions may occur from Japanese agricultural Andosols that are poorly drained.

AB The Argentine Pampa is one of the major global regions for the production of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. [Merr.]), but intense management practices have led to soil degradation and amplified greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents preliminary data on the effect of maize-soybean intercrops compared with maize and soybean sole crops on the short-term emission rates of CO2 and N2O and its relationship to soil moisture or temperature over two field seasons. Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the maize sole crop and intercrops, whereas soil bulk density was significantly lower in the intercrops. Soil CO2 emission rates were significantly greater in the maize sole crop but did not differ significantly for N2O emissions. Over two field seasons, both trace gases showed a general trend of greater emission rates in the maize sole crop followed by the soybean sole crop and were lowest in the intercrops. Linear regression between soil GHG (CO2 and N2O) emission rates and soil temperature or volumetric soil moisture were not significant except in the 1:2 intercrop where a significant relationship was observed between N2O emissions and soil temperature in the first field season and between N2O and volumetric soil moisture in the second field season. Our results demonstrated that intercropping in the Argentine Pampa may be a more sustainable agroecosystem land-management practice with respect to GHG emissions.

AB We investigated the effect of maize residues and rice husk biochar on biomass production, fertiliser nitrogen recovery (FNR) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions for three different subtropical cropping soils. Maize residues at two rates (0 and 10 t ha(-1)) combined with three rates (0, 15 and 30 t ha-1) of rice husk biochar were added to three soil types in a pot trial with maize plants. Soil N2O emissions were monitored with static chambers for 91 days. Isotopic N-15-labelled urea was applied to the treatments without added crop residues to measure the FNR. Crop residue incorporation significantly reduced N uptake in all treatments but did not affect overall FNR. Rice husk biochar amendment had no effect on plant growth and N uptake but significantly reduced N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in two of the three soils. The incorporation of crop residues had a contrasting effect on soil N2O emissions depending on the mineral N status of the soil. The study shows that effects of crop residues depend on soil properties at the time of application. Adding crop residues with a high C/N ratio to soil can immobilise N in the soil profile and hence reduce N uptake and/or total biomass production. Crop residue incorporation can either stimulate or reduce N2O emissions depending on the mineral N content of the soil. Crop residues pyrolysed to biochar can potentially stabilise native soil C (negative priming) and reduce N2O emissions from cropping soils thus providing climate change mitigation potential beyond the biochar C storage in soils. Incorporation of crop residues as an approach to recycle organic materials and reduce synthetic N fertiliser use in agricultural production requires a thorough evaluation, both in terms of biomass production and greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Intercropping with legumes is an important component of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in sub-Saharan Africa, but little is known about its effect on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. A field experiment was established at Hawassa in the Ethiopian rift valley, comparing nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in minerally fertilized maize (64 kg N ha(-1)) with and without Crotalaria (C. juncea) or lablab (L. purpureus) as intercrops over two growing seasons. To study the effect of intercropping time, intercrops were sown either 3 or 6 weeks after maize. The legumes were harvested at flowering, and half of the above-ground biomass was mulched. In the first season, cumulative N2O emissions were largest in 3-week lablab, with all other treatments being equal to or lower than the fertilized maize mono-crop. After reducing mineral N input to intercropped systems by 50% in the second season, N2O emissions were comparable with the fully fertilized control. Maize-yield-scaled N2O emissions in the first season increased linearly with aboveground legume N yield (p = 0:01), but not in the second season when early rains resulted in less legume biomass because of shading by maize. Growing-season N2O-N emission factors varied from 0.02% to 0.25% in 2015 and 0.11% to 0.20% in 2016 of the estimated total N input. Growing-season CH4 uptake ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 kg CH4-C ha(-1), with no significant differences between treatments or years but setting off the N2O-associated emissions by up to 69 %. Our results suggest that leguminous intercrops may increase N2O emissions when developing large biomass in dry years but, when mulched, can replace part of the fertilizer N in normal years, thus supporting CSA goals while intensifying crop production in the region.

AB Context: Cover cropping may improve soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and soil carbon (C) stocks, yet its effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil greenhouse gas balances remain unclear. The impact of cover crop species and mixtures varies over time, requiring further study. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the agronomic and environmental performance of different cover crops, including hairy vetch, rye, radish, their mixtures, and a seven-species mix, over three years. Methods: Over a three-year field experiment, we tested nine cover crop treatments - including rye, hairy vetch, radish, and their mixtures - and assessed their effects on biomass production, nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) inputs, soil macronutrients (N, P, K), greenhouse gas emissions (N2O), and yields of maize, sunflower, and soybean. Results: Hairy vetch and rye produced higher biomass, while radish contributed most to soil C inputs below-ground. Hairy vetch provided high N inputs (>200 kg N ha(-1) annually) but increased N2O emissions, revealing a trade-off between fertility and greenhouse gas emissions. Rye and radish emitted less N2O, with rye increasing soil organic C and potassium availability. The rye and vetch mixture combined high biomass production and soil C sequestration with moderate N2O emissions, making it a promising option for balancing productivity and sustainability. Rye-based treatments achieved a positive net soil CO2 balance. Sunflower and maize N uptake improved after vetch and rye-vetch cover crops, while soybean yield remained unaffected. Conclusion and implications: Cover crop mixtures with complementary traits can balance productivity and environmental impacts. Integrating rye and vetch enhances ecological functions, supporting sustainable crop production while mitigating climate change.

AB The study aimed to measure soil-atmosphere N2O fluxes and their controlling factors, as well as NH3 emissions and yields for two soils (silt loam and clay loam) in three management systems over two years under subsequent wheat and maize cultivation. The management systems were characterized as follows: (1) cash crop (C) with mineral fertilizer and conventional tillage; (2) livestock (L) with biogas residue fertilization and its incorporation prior to sowing in maize and reduced tillage; and (3) climate optimized (O) with minimum tillage, 8-year crop rotation, with biogas residue fertilization, in maize without incorporation in clay loam soil or incorporation by strip-tillage prior to seeding in silt loam soil. Stable isotope ratios of N2O and mineral N were determined to identify N2O processes. Within the organically fertilized maize treatments, cumulative N2O fluxes were highest in the O-system treatments of both sites (4.0 to 9.4 kg N ha- 1 a- 1), i.e. more than twice as high as in the L-system (1.5 to 3.1 kg N ha- 1 a- 1). Below root-strip till fertilizer application did not enhance N2O fluxes. Fluxes with mineral fertilization of wheat (1.1 to 3.1 kg N ha- 1 a- 1) were not different from those with organic fertilization. Isotopic values of emitted N2O revealed that bacterial denitrification dominated most of the peak flux events, while the N2O/(N2 + N2O) ratio of denitrification was mostly between 0.1 and 0.5. It can be concluded that, contrary to the intention to lower greenhouse gas fluxes by the O-system management, the highest N2O fluxes occurred in the O-system without biogas digestate incorporation in maize. With respect to NH3 fluxes, we could confirm that the application of digestate application in growing crops without incorporation or late incorporation in fertilization before sowing induces high fluxes. The beneficial aspects of the O-system including more stable soil structure and resource conservation, are thus potentially counteracted by increased N2O and NH3 emissions.

AB Background and Aim Continuous monocropping with high nitrogen (N) fertilizer input substantially increases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in maize-based agroecosystems in the North China Plain (NCP). Introducing soybeans as an intercrop with maize and partially substituting urea with manure might effectively decrease GHG emissions. The aim of this study was to quantify the synergistic effect of maize-soybean intercropping and manure on soil GHG emissions. Methods A two-year field experiment with three cropping systems (maize monocrop, soybean monocrop, and maize-soybean intercrop) and four N treatments (control, urea, manure, and manure + urea) was carried out at Luancheng Agro-Ecosystem Experimental Station in the NCP. All N treatments, except the control, received 150 kg N ha(-1)season(-1), either full dose as a basal application or two equal split applications. Results Results showed that all treatments contributed as a net source of N2O and CO2 fluxes but acted as a net sink of CH4 fluxes. In both cropping seasons, intercrops had significantly lower N2O emissions compared to monocropping systems, with 38% and 14% less emissions than maize monocrops in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, maize monocrops had significantly higher soil CO2 emissions than other systems, while maize-soybean intercropping had 12% and 13% less CO2 emissions than maize monocrops in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Among fertilized treatments, manure-treated soils emit notably lower N2O fluxes compared to sole urea treatments. In this study, N2O and CO2 fluxes had a strong positive correlation with soil mineral N concentrations, soil temperature, and moisture content. Possibly due to more efficient N utilization, intercrop soils exhibited significantly lower NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, leading to reduced nitrification and denitrification in the system, resulting in lower N2O emissions from maize-soybean intercrops. Conclusion Our findings indicate that intercropping maize and soybean reduces soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, as well as significantly decreasing soil N2O and CO2 emissions when compared to traditional maize monoculture. Therefore, due to its potential for reducing soil GHG emissions, maize-soybean intercropping can be regarded as an effective alternative cropping system to the prevailing maize-dominant monoculture to develop a sustainable agroecosystem in the NCP region.

AB It is a concern whether the effect of soil type on N2O emissions has to be considered for regional mitigation strategies and emission estimates in mountainous areas with inherent spatial heterogeneities of soil type. To date, there were few field experiments which investigated soil type effects on N2O emissions. Thus a 2-year field study was conducted to measure N2O emissions and soil environmental variables from three different soils that were formed from similar parental rock under the same climate. Seasonal N2O fluxes ranged from 0.18 to 0.40 kg N ha(-1) for wheat seasons and 0.40 to 1.50 kg N ha(-1) for maize seasons across different experimental soils. The intra-and inter-annual variations in N2O emissions were mainly triggered by temporal dynamics of soil temperature and moisture conditions. On average, seasonal N2O fluxes for acidic soils were significantly lower than for neutral and alkaline soils in cold-dry wheat seasons while significantly greater than for neutral and alkaline soils in warm-wet maize seasons. These determined differences of N2O emissions were mainly caused by differences of initial soil properties across different soils. Moreover, seasonal N2O fluxes were positively correlated with soil pH in wheat seasons, but negatively correlated in maize seasons. The temperature sensitivity coefficient (Q(10)) of soil N2O emissions for acidic soil (4.06) were significantly greater than those for neutral (1.82) and alkaline (1.15) soils. Overall, N2O emissions for acidic soils were not only higher than those for neutral and alkaline soils but also more sensitive to changing temperature. The present study highlights that soil type is needed to be carefully considered for regional estimate and proposing mitigation strategy of N2O emissions especially in subtropical mountain regions with inherent great heterogeneity of soil type.

AB Legume rotations and animal manures can reduce synthetic fertilizer use in row crops, but only long-term experiments can elucidate effects of multiple legume rotations and decades of manure additions on soil gas emissions. In 2006 and 2007, we measured soil-atmosphere fluxes of N2O, NH3, and CO2 in maize (Zea mays L.) crops within a replicated experiment comparing continuous maize to maize-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) rotations initiated in 1969. In both systems, comparisons of synthetic fertilizer N and manure N were initiated in 1990. With synthetic fertilizer as the main N source, mean CO2-C fluxes (from March 31st to October 18th) were lower from continuous maize (CC, 512 +/- 132 g m(-2) growing season(-1)) than from maize following alfalfa (CA, 691 +/- 91 g m(-2) growing season(-1)). In contrast, with manure as the main N source, mean soil CO2-C fluxes from CC (943 +/- 111 g m(-2) growing season(-1)) were greater than from CA (682 +/- 21 g m(-2) growing season(-1)). Soil CO2-C emissions correlated with long-term inputs of manure. Synthetically fertilized continuous maize had lower N2O-N fluxes (0.36 +/- 0.26 g m(-2) growing season(-1)) than other treatments (0.55-0.58 g m(-2) growing season(-1)). Nitrous oxide-N fluxes were not correlated with current N inputs or soil nitrate concentrations, suggesting that long-term treatment effects (e.g., on soil structure, labile C, or microbial communities) contribute to contemporary N2O variation. Elevated NH3 fluxes (>5 mg NH3-N m(-2) h(-1)) followed manure applications, but within weeks there were no significant treatment differences in NH3 fluxes. These results suggest that short-term or single-factor studies may not capture important interactions among crop rotations and N sources affecting greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soils.

AB Diverse crop rotations are increasingly recognized as key to address the global food crisis and improve environmental sustainability, including reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the specific effects on N2O emissions of different crops in these rotations and the underlying incidence on microbial processes remain underexplored. In a six-year field study, we compared N2O emissions from traditional wheat-maize rotation with diverse rotations, including legumes (peanut, soybean), ryegrass, sorghum, and sweet potato. We also examined the microbial functions associated with nitrogen cycling based on functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa (FAPROTAX) analysis. Our study showed that diversified crop rotations with reduced synthetic fertilization and irrigation can reduce N2O emissions by 23 %-49 % compared to conventional rotations. These reductions were supported by increases in soil organic carbon, soil carbon/nitrogen ratio and decreases in the relative abundance of denitrifying microorganisms, particularly observed in rotations with soybean and sweet potato. However, the spring maize and peanut-based rotation had higher emission factors than traditional wheat-maize rotation due to lower initial crop nitrogen uptake and lower nitrogen use efficiency, respectively. Changes in the microbial community structures of nitrification and denitrification processes, including increased activity of ammoniaoxidizing bacteria MND1 and archaea Candidatus Nitrososphaera in legume and sweet potato rotations, and a shift in denitrifying microbes of diverse rotations (a decrease in Rhodoplanes and an increase in Paracoccus), significantly contributed to the overall reductions in emissions in all other investigated rotation systems. Understanding the microbial mechanisms that control N2O emissions from agricultural soils will enable the development of more effective and crop-specific strategies to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Ammonia volatilization (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission are the main underliers of nitrogen loss in farmlands, which can decrease nitrogen use efficiency and trigger environmental problems regarding greenhouse effects. Previous studies have regional limitations and lack universal guiding significance, as they are primarily based on individual experiments related to the effects of applying nitrogen fertilizer on maize. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis on a regional scale to investigate the overall impact of nitrogen fertilizer application on maize yield, N2O, and NH3 in Northeast China. The database included 85 studies and 1147 pairs of experimental data that were analyzed. The results showed that applying nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased maize yield, N2O emissions, and NH3 volatilization effects, and the growth rates (E) were 50.64%, 64.39%, and 69.25%, respectively. In Northeast China, the average emission factors of N2O and NH3 were 0.72% and 8.21%, respectively. The optimum nitrogen application rate for maize in Northeast China was 205 kg ha(-1), resulting in 8.37% nitrogen loss (through N2O and NH3). Soil texture, alkaline nitrogen (AN) content in the soil, mean annual precipitation (MAP), nitrogen application rate, and fertilizer type were the key influential factors affecting changes in maize yield and N loss (N2O and NH3). Yield-scaled N2O and NH3 were found to be the significant emission reduction parameters that ensured maize yield. However, there was a remarkable 'seesaw effect' between yield-scaled N2O and NH3 under the same natural conditions (MAP and soil texture). Therefore, human activities such as reducing N surplus in soil, and N fertilizer application rate, along with selecting suitable fertilizer types should be given more attention to reduce yield-scaled N2O and NH3. Moreover, minimizing NH3 and N2O dual emission should be the main objective for green agriculture in Northeast China, rather than over-emphasizing on single emission reduction.

AB Agricultural soils are main sources and sinks of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The source-sink function depends on soil characteristics, climate and management. Emission measurements usually quantify the net result of production, consumption and transport of these gases in the soil; they do not provide information about the depth distributions of the concentrations of these gases in the soil. Here we report on concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O in air of 300 cm deep soil profiles, at resolutions of 30-50 cm, over a full year. Gas samples were taken weekly in a long-term field experiment with an irrigated winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system, and four fertilizer N application rates (0, 200, 400 and 600 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). The results showed distinct differences in CH4, CO2 and N2O concentrations profiles with soil depth. The concentrations of CO2 in soil air increased with soil depth and showed a seasonal pattern with relatively high concentrations in the warm and moist maize growing season and relatively low concentrations in the winter-wheat growing season. In contrast, CH4 concentrations decreased with depth, and did not show a distinct seasonal cycle. Urea application did not have a large effect on CH4 or CO2 concentrations, neither in the topsoil nor the subsoil. Concentrations of N2O responded to N fertilizer application and irrigation. Application of fertilizer strongly increased grain and straw yields of both winter wheat and summer maize, relatively to the control, but differences in yield between the treatments N200, N400 and N600 were not statistically significant. However, it significantly increased mean N2O concentrations peaks at basically all soil depths. Interestingly, concentrations of N2O increased almost instantaneously in the whole soil profile, which indicates that the soil had a relatively high diffusivity, despite compacted subsoil layers.
   In conclusion, the frequent measurements, at high depth resolutions, of concentrations of CH4, CO2 and N2O in soil air under a winter wheat-summer maize double crop rotation provide detailed insight into the production, consumption and transport of these gases in the soil. Concentrations of CH4, CO2 and N2O responded differently to management activities and weather conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Croplands account for similar to one-third of global anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. A number of recent field experiments found substantial fallow-period N2O emissions, which have been neglected for decades. However, the global contribution of the fallow-period emissions and the associated drivers remain unclear. Based on 360 observations across global agroecosystems, we simulated the ratio of the fallow to the whole-year N2O emissions (R-fallow) by developing a mixed-effect model and compiling cropping-system-specific input data. Our results revealed that the mean global gridded R-fallow was 44% (15%-75%, 95% confidence interval), with hotspots mainly in the northern high latitudes. For most cropping systems, soil pH was the dominant driver of global variation in R-fallow. Global cropland emission factors (i.e., the percentage of fertilizer N emitted as N2O, EFs) in EF-based models doubled to 1.9% when the fallow-period N2O emissions were included in our simulation, similar to EFs estimated by process-based and atmospheric inversion models (1.8%-2.3%). Overall, our study highlights the importance of fallow-period N2O emissions in annual totals, especially for single cropping systems and croplands in acidic areas. To accurately estimate N2O emissions for national greenhouse gas inventories, it is crucial to update current EFs with full consideration of the fallow-period N2O emissions in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 method.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas emitted at considerable rates from agricultural soils. A few recent studies have indicated the potential to reduce N2O emission rates in agricultural systems through management of soil microbiota, such as mycorrhizal fungi. Our limited understanding of how mycorrhiza influences N2O emission rates, however, forestalls such management practices. To address the knowledge gap regarding the mechanism of mycorrhizal modification of N2O formation and denitrification, we disentangle the direct effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) via hyphal growth on potential denitrification activity from those resulting from indirect AMF-induced changes in soil aggregation. We manipulated AMF status in a factorial experiment through adding or not AMF inoculum in the form of Rhizophagus irregularis and soil aggregation state through either crushing soil aggregates or using agricultural soil with intact soil aggregates. We then grew Zea mays (maize) in compartmentalized mesocosms for 4 months. At harvest, we observed approximately three-fold higher AMF root colonization and hyphal densities in the treatments where we had added Rhizophagus irregularis. Potential N2O activity rates and the denitrification ratio were higher in the undisturbed soil and in the mesocosms with a dense AMF hyphal network (direct effect of mycorrhiza). Further, AM-hyphae promoted soil aggregation while also altering potential denitrification activity (indirect effect of mycorrhiza).

AB The application of nitrification or urease inhibitors together with nitrogen (N) fertilizer has been proposed to reduce N losses, including nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, from agricultural soils. We measured N2O fluxes, crop yield and plant N content over 3 years (2012-2015) to evaluate the long-term effects of nitrification and/or urease inhibitors on N2O emissions, crop production and N use efficiency (NUE) in an intensively farmed wheat maize system in northern China. The experiment consisted of the following five treatments: 1) CK, no N fertilizer; 2) U, urea; 3) NI, urea with 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP); 4) UI, urea with N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT); and 5) NIUI, urea with combined DMPP and NBPT. Compared with the U treatment, the NI, NIUI and UI treatments mitigated cumulative N2O emissions by 55%, 40% and 21% in the maize season, respectively, and 47%, 40% and 33% in the wheat season, respectively. The annual direct emission factors of N2O for the U, NI, UI and NIUI treatments were 0.4%, 0.1%, 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. The NIUI, NI and UI treatments increased the annual crop yield (7%, 6% and 4%) and the NUE (15%, 10% and 7%) relative to the U treatment. The NI treatment showed the best effect on mitigating N2O emissions, but its efficacy was reduced when applied together with UI. This indicates that more studies are required focusing on the performances and mechanisms of these two inhibitors in alkaline and low organic carbon soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For a long time, farmers in the red soil region of southern China have returned crop residues to the soil, but how various crop residues influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is not well understood. We compared the influence of returning different crop residues [rapeseed cake (RC), maize straw, rice straw and wheat straw (WS)] in combination with different levels of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (nil, low and high) on red soil N2O emissions. Results confirmed the inverse relationship between cumulative N2O emissions and residue C:N ratio in red soil under different levels of N fertilizer. However, N-fertilizer application did not significantly influence N2O emissions in the WS (which had the highest C:N ratio) and corresponding control treatments, while it enhanced N2O emissions in the RC (which had the lowest C:N ratio) treatment and displayed significantly higher cumulative N2O emissions with low N fertilizer application. This phenomenon may be attributed to the poor nutrient content in red soil, which leads to Liebig's Law of the Minimum' on available C. N fertilizer application provided sufficient available N, while the readily available C, which was mainly dependent on the degradability of the residue, became the crucial factor influencing N2O emissions. Additional experiments, which showed that the addition of glucose and sucrose could increase N2O emissions when N (NH4+-N) was sufficient, confirmed this hypothesis. Thus, to reduce N2O emissions when returning residues to red soil, we suggest that both the residue C:N ratio and the quality should be considered when deciding whether to apply N fertilizer.

AB Grassland renewal and grassland conversion to arable land are common agricultural practices on intensively used grassland sites, especially in north-western Europe. However, grassland ploughing can cause a flush of soil organic nitrogen (N) mineralisation due to soil disturbance during tillage and decomposition of stubble and roots from the old grass sward. This is known to result in enhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but information about the underlying microbial processes, especially the role of N2O reduction to N-2 via denitrification, is scarce. Therefore we applied the N-15 gas flux method in situ to grassland recently ploughed under for maize cropping, renewed grassland and permanent grassland on a Histic Gleysol and a Plaggic Anthrosol which differed in organic matter content and drainage. We used needle injection of N-15-labelled KNO3- at three different depths in the soil to achieve homogeneous label distribution. Fluxes of N2O and N-2, mineral N concentration and N-15 enrichment of these were measured for 44 days after label addition. Overall, no differences in N2O and N-2 emissions were found between grassland conversion/renewal and permanent grassland. N-2 emissions increased up to 9115 g N ha(-1) day(-1) on a single sampling day following grassland conversion to maize cropping on the Histic Gleysol, leading to a great contribution of denitrification when N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratio was low. However, heterogeneity of N-15 label distribution proved to be a major difficulty in the water-saturated Histic Gleysol and caused potential uncertainty in identification of various production pathways. Lower gaseous losses and higher nitrification potential were detected in the Plaggic Anthrosol, indicating a higher threat of possible leaching of excess mineral N following grassland conversion/renewal.

AB Biochar (BC) application to low fertility soils is a promising approach to increase crop yield, improve soil quality, and mitigate climate change simultaneously. Only few studies evaluated the combined effects of BC and nitrogen (N) fertilization rates on crop productivity and N losses under field conditions. The objectives were to investigate combined effects of BC (2 rates) and N (5 rates) fertilization on crop productivity and N losses in a long-term field experiment started in 2008 in a winter wheat/summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain. Linear-plateau models best described the responses of wheat and maize yields to N rates. N2O fluxes, NH3 volatilization, and soil mineral N contents increased exponentially with N fertilization rates. Despite the effect of BC on wheat or maize yields was negligible, BC retains of mineral N at 240 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). BC application increased NH3 volatilization by 31% in wheat season and 26% in maize season because of pH increase. BC reduced N2O emissions by 8-23% in the wheat season and by 24% at lower N rates (<= 60 kg ha(-1)) in the maize season, due to BC induced complete denitrification to N-2. BC stimulated N2O emissions by 18-26% compared to soils without BC in maize season at N rates higher than 60 kg ha(-1). The combination of increased mineral N retention and C availability with BC addition increased nitrification and/or denitrification rates, leading to increased N2O emissions. For the wheat/maize rotation system, BC application decreased N2O emissions at lower N rates (<= 120 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) but had no effects at higher N rates. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylphyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on N-fertilized crop growth and soil N2O emissions were studied at two experimental sites in Southern Italy, characterised by a Mediterranean climate and different soil texture. The experiments were a randomized block design of two treatments: crop fertilized with NH4NO3 (considered the control treatment) or amended with DMPP plus NH4NO3 (considered the DMPP treatment). ANOVA was performed to assess differences between treatments and fertilization periods whereas simple and multiple linear regressions were performed in order to assess the effect of the soil-related independent variables on soil gases emissions. Growth of potato plants fertilized with DMPP-added nitrogen was enhanced compared to control plants, whereas no benefit on maize plants grown during summer was observed. N2O emissions measured from soil to potato after the first fertilization with DMPP-added nitrogen was reduced during winter, but was higher than control after the second fertilizer application in spring, leading to comparable N2O emission factors (EF1) between treatments. In maize N2O emissions and EF1 were lower for DMPP compared to control treatment. The effectiveness of reduction in soil N2O emission was influenced by soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) in both experimental sites. However, the overall effect of WFPS was contrasting as N2O emissions were decreased in potato and enhanced in maize.

AB Maize and wheat are major cereals that contribute two-thirds of the food energy intake globally. The two crops consume about 35% of the nitrogen (N) fertilizer used in agriculture and thereby contribute to fertilizer-induced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Thus, estimation of spatially disaggregated N2O emissions from maize and wheat fields on a global scale could be useful for identifying emission and mitigation hotspots. It could also be needed for prioritizing mitigation options consistent with location-specific production and environmental goals. N2O emission from four models (CCAFS-MOT, IPCC Tier-I, IPCC Tier-II and Tropical N2O) using a standard gridded dataset from global maize and wheat fields were compared and their performance evaluated using measured N2O emission data points (777 globally distributed datapoints). The models were used to quantify spatially disaggregated N2O emission and mitigation potential from maize and wheat fields globally and the values were compared. Although the models differed in their performance of capturing the level of measured N2O emissions, they produced similar spatial patterns of annual N2O emissions from maize and wheat fields. Irrespective of the models, predicted N2O emissions per hectare were higher in some countries in East and South Asia, North America, and Western Europe, driven mainly by higher N application rates. The study indicated a substantial N2O abatement potential if application of excess N in the maize and wheat systems is reduced without compromising the yield of the crops through technological and crop management innovations. N2O mitigation potential is higher in those countries and regions where N application rates and current N2O emissions are already high. The estimated mitigation potentials are useful for hotspot countries to target fertilizer and crop management as one of the mitigation options in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured over a 3-year period (2004-2007) in a long-term experimental field. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the interannual variation of N2O emissions from a maize-wheat rotation, under different fertilizer regimes and to determine the key controlling factors. The study involved four treatments: compost (OM), half compost N plus half inorganic fertilizer-N (HOM), inorganic fertilizer-N (NPK), and control (CK) where no N application. The mean annual N2O emission over a 3-year period was 030 +/- 0.11 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the CK treatment, but increased to 1.61 +/- 0.10 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the HOM treatment, 2.13 +/- 0.15 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the OM treatment, and 2.76 +/- 0.19 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the NPK treatment. Differences were significant among treatments. The N2O emission factors of the applied OM, NPK and HUM were 0.61 +/- 0.02, 0.82 +/- 0.10 and 0.44 +/- 0.04%, respectively, at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), indicating that the combined application of compost with inorganic fertilizer significantly reduced N2O emission. Over a maize-wheat rotation year, more than 65% of the annual N2O emission occurred during the maize growing season. There was a large interannual variation in N2O emission in all treatments, albeit not significant either during the maize growing season or at an inter-year scale. This interannual variation was mainly attributable to differences in soil moisture after basal fertilizer application, and irrigation and/or heavy rainfall events immediately following basal fertilization could induce more N2O production than pre-irrigation before plowing. The HOM treatment had higher N fertilizer use efficiency and lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions compared with the OM and NPK treatments. We therefore argue that the combined application of half compost N plus half fertilizer-N will mitigate N2O emissions from soils in the North China plain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Quantifying the nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes emitted from croplands remains a major challenge. Field measurements in different climates, soil and agricultural conditions are still scarce and emissions are generally assessed from a small number of measurements. In this study, we report continuously measured N2O and NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over a 2-year crop sequence of barley and maize in northern France. Measurements were carried out using 6 automatic chambers at a rate of 16 mean flux measurements per day. Additional laboratory measurements on soil cores were conducted to study the response of NO and N2O emissions to environmental conditions.
   The detection limit of the chamber setup was found to be 3 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for N2O and 0.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for NO. Nitrous oxide fluxes were higher than the threshold 37% of the time, while they were 72% of the time for NO fluxes.
   The cumulated annual NO and N2O emissions were 1.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 0.5 kg NO-N ha(-1) in 2007, but 2.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 0.7 kg NO-N ha(-1) in 2008. These inter-annual differences were largely related to crop types and to their respective management practices. The forms, amounts and timing of nitrogen applications and the mineralization of organic matter by incorporation of crop residues were found to be the main factor controlling the emissions peaks. The inter-annual variability was also due to different weather conditions encountered in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, the fractioned N inputs applied on barley (54 kg ha(-1) in March and in April) did not generate N2O emissions peaks because of the low rainfall during the spring. However, the significant rainfall observed in the summer and fall of 2007, promoted rapid decomposition of barley residues which caused high levels of N2O emissions. In 2008, the application of dairy cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer before the emergence of maize (107 kg N-min ha(-1) or 130 kg N-tot ha(-1) in all) coincided with large rainfalls promoting both NO and N2O emissions, which remained high until early summer.
   Laboratory measurements corroborated the field observations: NO fluxes were maximum at a water-filled pore space (WFPS) of around 27% while N2O fluxes were optimal at 68% WFPS, with a maximum potentially 14 times larger than for NO. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) contributes to global climate change and agricultural soils seem to be the major source. Lack of information led to this study on the influence of different amounts and sources of nitrogen on N2O emission from a maize (Zea mays L.)-groundnut (Arachis hypogae L.) crop rotation in an Ultisol of the humid tropics. The treatments were: inorganic N + crop residues (NC), inorganic N only (RN), and half of inorganic N + crop residues + chicken manure (NCM). The corresponding amount of N applied was 322, 180, and 400 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The N2O emissions depended on the amounts and types of N. A maximum peak (9889 +/- 2106 muLg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)) was detected at 2 wk before maize sowing amended with chicken manure, showing a persistent influence on N transformations and N2O release. The mineral N from either applied source became low by 2 to 4 wk, coinciding with the small N2O fluxes or its consumption to a few isolated instances. The N2O flux significantly correlated with the mineral N and water-filled pore spaces. The direct annual N2O emission was 3.94 +/- 0.23, 1.90 +/- 0.08, and 1.41 +/- 0.07 kg N2O-N ha(-1) from the NCM, NC, and RN treatments, respectively. The corresponding N2O-N loss of the applied N plus N fixed by groundnut was 0.83,0.49, and 0.59%. Overestimations of direct annual N2O emission using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology suggest a location-specific emission factor for variable N sources to be considered.

AB Agricultural production plays an important role in affecting atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations. Field measurements were conducted in Dalian City, Liaoning Province in Northeast China from two consecutive years (2009 and 2010) to estimate N2O emissions from a spring maize field, a main cropping system across the Chinese agricultural regions. The observed flux data in conjunction with the local climate, soil and management information were utilized to test a process-based model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), for its applicability for the cropping system. The validated DNDC was then used for exploring strategies to reduce N2O emissions from the target field. The results showed that the major N2O pulse emissions occurred with duration of about 3-5 d after fertilizer application in both years 2009 and 2010, which on average accounted for about 60% of the total N2O emissions each year. Rainfall and fertilizer application were the major factors influencing the N2O emissions from spring maize field. The average N2O fluxes from the CK (control plot, without fertilization) and FP (traditional chemical N fertilizer) treatments were 23.1 and 60.6 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in 2009, respectively, and 21.5 and 64.3 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in 2010, respectively. The emission factors (EFs) of the applied N fertilizer (270 kg N ha(-1)) as N2O-N were 0.62% in 2009 and 0.77% in 2010, respectively. The comparison of modeled daily N2O emission fluxes against observations indicated that the DNDC model had a good performance even if without adjusting the internal parameters. The modeled results showed that management practices such as no-till, changing timing or rate of fertilizer application, increasing residue incorporation, and other technically applicable measures could effectively reduce N2O emissions from the tested fields. Our study indicated that avoiding application of N fertilizers at heavy rainfall events or splitting the fertilizer into more applications would be the most feasible approaches to reduce N2O emissions from spring maize production in Northeast China.

AB Nitrogen (N) fertilization and straw incorporation strongly influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural fields. An in-situ micro-plot experiment on intensively farmed winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted to investigate the source and rate of N2O emissions from soils following labeled N-15 fertilization with and without straw incorporation. Four treatments, i.e., no N fertilizer and no straw incorporation (N0S0), straw incorporation only (N0S1), N fertilizer only (N1S0), and N fertilization plus straw incorporation (N1S1), were established in the experiment. The N2O emissions mainly occurred after N fertilization and lasted for approximately 1-2 weeks, accounting for 60%-67% of the wheat seasonal N2O emissions. Within the 6 days after basal fertilization and 2-4 days after top-dressing, most of the N2O fluxes (> 50%) were derived from fertilizer. Thereafter, soil-derived N2O dominated the total N2O emissions and within 10-20 days after N fertilization, fertilizer-derived N2O became negligible. Fertilizer N and soil N both accounted for 40%-60% of the seasonal N2O emissions, which may be explained by the high soil N stock due to long-term high N fertilization in the region. This implies the similar roles of soil N pool and fertilizer N in N2O generation under intensively farmed soils. The N fertilization had a significant priming effect on the turnover of soil N, which contributed 21.02%-50.47% of the total N2O emissions. During the basal fertilization/first irrigation event, straw incorporation significantly (P < 0.05) stimulated CO2 fluxes both in N-fertilized and non-N-fertilized plots; however, after the top-dressing/second irrigation event, the significant increase of CO2 fluxes induced by straw incorporation was only observed in the N-fertilized treatment. Straw incorporation interacted with N fertilization, and tended to enhance N2O emissions in the basal fertilization and lower N2O emissions in the top-dressing period. In N-fertilized plots, the seasonal N2O emissions from straw-incorporated and straw-removed treatments were similar, indicating that straw incorporation enhanced the N supply without increasing the N2O emissions. Our study highlights that there are significant benefits of straw incorporation to soil fertility improvement; however, the long-term impacts of straw incorporation on greenhouse gas emissions should be further examined.

AB Plastic mulching is an important agricultural practice to increase crop yield by increasing soil temperature and moisture. Plastic mulching can also affect soil greenhouse gas emissions [e.g., N2O emissions and NH3 volatilization] and soil characteristics such as soil enzyme and microbial activities, but the simultaneous effects of plastic mulching on these parameters and the potential links between them are rarely evaluated. Here, we conducted a field study to investigate the concurrent responses of N2O emissions, NH3 volatilization, soil enzyme and microbial activities, soil dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON), and crop yield to plastic mulching (mulching) and no mulching (ambient) under consecutive winter wheat-summer maize rotation cycles in China's Loess Plateau. The mulching treatment significantly increased soil water-filled pore spaces (WFPS) and soil temperature during growing cycle 1 (2018-2019 winter wheat and 2019 summer maize) and cycle 2 (2019-2020 winter wheat and 2020 summer maize). Averaged across both growing cycles, the mulching treatment significantly increased winter wheat yield by 31.8 %, summer maize yield by 36.4 %, soil NO3--N content by 18.2 %, NH4+-N content by 27.4 %, cumulative N2O emissions by 34.0 % and NH3 volatilization by 50.6 %, relative to the ambient treatment. Moreover, the mulching treatment significantly enhanced soil alkaline phosphatase, invertase, catalase, and urease activities and soil microbial biomass C and N contents in the 0-10 cm soil layer across both growing cycles. This study revealed a tradeoff, with plastic mulching significantly improving crop yields and soil enzyme and microbial activities but not mitigating N2O emissions or NH3 volatilization. Our results highlight that simultaneously documenting gaseous N emissions and changes in soil properties under plastic mulching can advance the understanding of sustainable agriculture in semi-arid areas.

AB Biochar amendment has been proposed as a strategy to improve soil quality and mitigate climate change. Yet the extent and regulating mechanisms of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in response to amendment of biochars derived from different feedstock have not been clearly demonstrated. A 12-month field trial was conducted to study the impact of two distinct biochar feedstocks (pine chip and peanut shell, at 10 and 30 t ha(-1)) with (+N) and without nitrogen (N) (-N) fertilization on soil N dynamics, N2O emissions, plant performance and microbial gene abundance. The cumulative N2O emissions varied greatly with biochar feedstock and application rate, and N fertilization. Pine biochar (at 30 t ha(-1)) significantly increased N2O emissions (by 48%) compared to control under -N, while peanut shell biochar (at 30 t ha(-1)) significantly increased N2O emissions (by 131%) compared to control under +N. Overall, biochar amendments had no impact on soil mineral N (NH4+ and NO3-) under both -N and +N. Under -N, biochar amendments showed no effect on plant yield, whereas under +N yield was significantly improved by 25-27% from pine biochar treatments. Under +N, only pine biochar (at 10 t ha(-1)) significantly increased plant N uptake (by 47%), and only peanut shell biochar (at 30 t ha(-1)) significantly enhanced soil AOB, narG, nirS and nosZ gene abundance. Increased soil N2O emission under -N from pine biochar amendment is likely to be regulated by improved water retention. However, increases in N2O emission from peanut shell biochar under +N could be driven by its large N inputs, labile organic C concentration and the increased soil pH which might largely facilitate biotic processes as evidenced by higher narG, nirS and AOB gene abundance. Positive feedback to N2O emission by biochar application revealed from this study is inconsistent with many current biochar studies, showing that caution should be exercised when considering use of biochar to mitigate N2O emission.

AB Biochar application is thought to improve crop yield and reduce N leaching and gas emissions; however, little is known about how field-aged biochar affects fertilizer N retention and N2O emissions. Here, a field microplot experiment is established in the North China Plain at maize season by applying N-15-labeled urea to the sandy loam soil both with (Biochar) and without (Control) application of 3-year field-aged biochar at 12 t ha(-1). Overall, 25.6-26.2% of the urea N was taken up by maize aboveground biomass, field-aged biochar did not affect yield or fertilizer N recovery efficiency. After maize harvest, the residual ratio of applied N in the soil profile (0-40 cm) was 21.6 and 20.3% under Control and Biochar treatment, respectively, with an increase of 10.2% in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and decrease of 37.2% in the subsoil (20-40 cm) following biochar amendment, probably due to reduced NO3- leaching. Cumulative N2O emissions and urea N-induced N2O emissions under Control treatment were 2.06 and 0.78 kg N ha(-1), and significantly decreased to 1.89 and 0.74 kg N ha(-1) after Biochar treatment, respectively. N2O emissions derived from the applied N accounted for 38.0 and 39.4% of the total emissions under Control and Biochar treatment, respectively. N2O emissions from decomposition of soil organic N induced by the priming effect of the applied N was 0.69 and 0.56 kg N ha(-1) under Control and Biochar treatment, respectively, contributing 33.7 and 29.7% of the total emissions. Overall, our results suggest that field-aged biochar increased the retention of fertilizerNin the topsoil by reducing NO3 leaching, while effectively reduced N2O emissions from fertilizer N and mineralization of organic N in the sandy loam soil.

AB Since it is known that nitrous oxide (N2O) production and consumption pathways are affected by soil pH, optimising the pH of agricultural soils can be an important approach to reduce N2O emissions. Because liming effects on N2O reduction had not been studied under ambient atmosphere and typical bulk density of arable soils, we conducted mesoscale incubation experiments with soils from two liming trials to investigate the impact of long-term pH management and fresh liming on N transformations and N2O production. Soils differed in texture and covered a range of pH levels (3.8-6.7), consisting of non-limed controls, long-term field-limed calcite and dolomite treatments, and freshly limed soils. Both soils were amended with N-15-labelled potassium nitrate (KNO3) and incubated with and without incorporated maize litter. Packed soil mesocosms were cycled through four phases of alternating temperatures and soil moistures for at least 40 days. Emissions of N2O and dinitrogen (N-2) as well as the product ratio of denitrification N2O/(N2O + N-2), referred to as N(2)Oi were measured with the N-15 gas flux method in N-2-reduced atmosphere. Emissions of N2O increased in response to typical denitrifying conditions (high moisture and presence of litter). Increased temperature and soil moisture stimulated microbial activity and triggered denitrification as judged from (NO3-)-N-15 pool derived N2O + N-2 emissions. Fresh liming increased denitrification in the sandy soil up to 3-fold but reduced denitrification in the loamy soil by 80%. N(2)Oi decreased throughout the incubation in response to fresh liming from 0.5-0.8 to 0.3-0.4, while field-limed soils had smaller N(2)Oi (0.1-0.3) than unlimed controls (0.9) irrespective of incubation conditions. Our study shows that the denitrification response (i.e., N2O + N-2 production) to liming is soil dependent, whereas liming effects on N(2)Oi are consistent for both long- and short-term pH management. This extends previous results from anoxic slurry incubation studies by showing that soil pH management by liming has a good mitigation potential for agricultural N2O emissions from denitrification under wet conditions outside of cropping season.

AB In soil, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxiclizing archaea (AOA) are regarded as key factors mediating nitrous oxide (N2O) production and emission. However, there are scarce reports about the effect of film mulching on ammonia oxidizers, and the biological nitrification process of N2O emission is unclear. This study was based on potato field experiments under different mulching films, including polyethylene mulching film (PM), transparent degradable mulching film (TDM), black degradable mulching film (BDM), and bare land (CK). AOB and AOA abundances were estimated using real-Lime PCR, and their diversity and community structure were measured using high-throughput sequencing. Result revealed that the total N2O emission from CI< was 12.32%-41.03% higher than that from film mulching soil. Under film mulching, according to total N2O emission from soil and N2O concentration in soil treatments were ordered as PM > BDM > TDM, and N2O production was closely correlated with copy numbers of the amoA gene. BDM significantly increased the number of arrioA-AOB gene copies (P < 0.01), and PM significantly increased the those of wnoA-AOA (P < 0.01). BDM and TDM increased AOB operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chaol, Simpson, and Shannon indices, while PM increased the AOA OTUs and Chaol index. Variations in AOA abundance and diversity were closely related to soil mineral N and temperature changes induced by polyethylene film mulching (P < 0.05), whereas AOB showed no significant association with soil properties. Meanwhile, we did not find a distinct treatment effect on AOB community structure. Our findings indicate that (i) degradable film mulching increased AOB abundance and diversity and N2O concentration, but obviously reduced N2O emissions, and (ii) AOA were more sensitive than AOB W polyethylene mulching film.

AB The well-known benefits of cover cropping for mitigating climate change and improving soil quality could be threatened by increased greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, such practices could have negative consequences in the context of global climate change. The present year-long field experiment, carried out under irrigated semiarid conditions, evaluated the effect of returning maize crop residues at two topsoil input levels in combination with bare fallow, a cereal (barley, Hordeum vulgare L.) and a legume (vetch, Vicia sativa L.) as cover crops as part of an annual cover crop-cash crop (maize, Zea mays L.) rotation. In addition, control plots, without the addition of nitrogen fertilizer (either in the previous cropping season or during the experiment), were established following the same experimental design in order to assess the carry-over impact of residual nitrogen from prior crops. Nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured together with soil mineral nitrogen and crop yields and nitrogen use efficiency. The significant effect of maize residue input on N2O emissions during the cover crop phase (this was 43% greater for the lower maize residue input than for the higher) was offset after subsequent maize fertilization (there was a 170% increase following the higher maize residue input compared to the lower). Although no differences in soil mineral nitrogen content were reported between treatments before maize fertilization, N2O emissions were 72% higher on the fertilized plots than on the control plots. Before maize fertilization, N2O emissions were increased by the incorporation of cover crop residues and soil rewetting after irrigation, with the highest N2O fluxes being reported for the cereal crop. Cumulative CO2 fluxes were higher in the plots with cover crops (cereal and legume) than in bare fallow plots, while CH4 sink was not affected by cover cropping or maize residue input. The grain yield penalty for maize production (a 7% decrease) with the legume cover crop on the nitrogen fertilized plots (the opposite of what was observed in the control area) highlights the need for an accurate estimation of the nitrogen supply from the mineralization of legume residues. Overall, cover crop and maize residue input did not have any significant effect on annual cumulative N2O emissions, so the positive effects of these practices should be considered to recommend them under semiarid conditions for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

AB Grassland conversion to cropland bears a risk of increased nitrate (NO3-) leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission due to enhanced nitrogen (N) mineralization. This study investigates the dynamics of mineral N and N2O emissions following chemical and mechanical conversion from permanent grassland to cropland (maize) at two sites with different texture (clayey loam and sandy loam) and fertilization regime (with and without mineral N-fertilization) over a two-year period. Soil mineral N levels increased shortly after conversion and remained elevated in converted plots compared to permanent grassland or long-term cropland in the second year of investigation. Fluxes of N2O were higher from converted plots than permanent grassland or cropland. However, soil mineral N contents and cumulative N2O emissions did not differ between conversion types. Only the distribution of N2O losses over the two years differed: while losses were of similar magnitude in both years in mechanically converted plots, the major part of N2O loss in chemically converted plots occurred in the first year after conversion while emissions approximated grassland level in the second year. N2O fluxes were mainly controlled by water-filled pore space and soil NO3- levels. Despite differences in N levels at the two sites, these key findings are similar on both study sites. They indicate strongly accelerated mineralization after conversion, an effect that still lasted in the converted plots at the end of the two-year investigation irrespective of the conversion type used.

AB Information on the influence of tillage on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is needed by researchers, policy makers and farmers for assessment of global ramifications of warming potential of greenhouse gas NO. This research evaluates the effects of continuous long-term tillage and seasonal changes in N2O emissions in New Zealand temperate climate. The experiment was conducted in a Kairanga silty clay loam (Eutric. Gleysol) where maize (Zea mays L.) was grown continuously for either 17 (K17) or 34 (K34) years, with conventional tillage. An adjacent permanent ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and clover (Trifolium sp.) pasture (PP) was used as a control. Mean N2O emissions under K17 and K34 and PP ranged from 0.04 to 1.35, 0.03 to 1.13, and 0.03 to 0.99 g N2O-N/ha/h, respectively. Average annual N2O emissions from K34 were slightly lower than those in the K17 fields although there were no differences in N2O emissions between PP and K17. Depleted organic C, total N and microbial biomass C in K34 as compared with K17, possibly limited denitrification process and decreased N2O emissions. Soil water content (SWC) was a key factor controlling N2O emissions in both pasture and cropped soils. Low emissions occurred when gravimetric SWC content was less than 30%. N2O emissions from grazed pasture were low during summer (dry) period and increased during winter (wet) season. There were no differences in N2O between the K17 and K34 during dry season but N2O emission rates in wet season were lower in the K34. Despite high temporal variability observed in the N2O emissions, our estimates based on low frequency of measurements over I year were in general agreement with those in the literature.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agroecosystems are a major contributor to global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. However, knowledge concerning the hotspots and hot moments of soil N2O emissions with manure application and irrigation, as well as the underlying mechanisms remain incomplete. Here, a 3-year field experiment was conducted with the combination of fertilization (no fertilizer, F0; 100% chemical fertilizer N, Fc; 50% chemical N + 50% manure N, Fc + m; and 100% manure N, Fm) and irrigation (with irrigation, W1; and without irrigation, W0; at wheat jointing stage) for winter wheat - summer maize cropping system in the North China Plain. Results showed that irrigation did not affect annual N2O emissions of the wheat-maize system. Manure application (Fc + m and Fm) reduced annual N2O emissions by 25-51% compared with Fc, which mainly occurred during 2 weeks after fertilization combined with irrigation (or heavy rainfall). In particular, Fc + m reduced the cumulative N2O emissions during 2 weeks after winter wheat sowing and summer maize top dressing by 0.28 and 0.11 kg ha-1, respectively, compared with Fc. Meanwhile, Fm maintained the grain N yield and Fc + m increased grain N yield by 8% compared with Fc under W1. Overall, Fm maintained the annual grain N yield and lower N2O emissions compared to Fc under W0, and Fc + m increased the annual grain N yield and maintained N2O emissions compared with Fc under W1, respectively. Our results provide scientific support for using manure to minimize N2O emissions while maintaining crop N yield under optimal irrigation to support the green transition in agricultural production.

AB Context: Maize/legume intercropping presents a sustainable agricultural strategy to enhance nitrogen use efficiency and mitigate environmental impacts. Research question: The impact of maize/legume strip intercropping on N2O emissions, crop yields, and the associated mechanisms are not yet fully understood, particularly in the context of straw incorporation practices. Methods: A two-year field experiment comparing five cropping systems (maize/peanut strip intercropping, maize/soybean strip intercropping, and corresponding monocropping) either with or without straw incorporation. Results: Maize/legume strip intercropping increased yields by 15-24 % and reduced N2O emissions by 15-22 % compared to the expected intercropping. This increase in yields, combined with the reduction in N2O emissions, led to a 20-39 % reduction N2O emission per unit of production in intercropped systems. The primary reduction in emissions occurred 7-10 days after the second fertilization, accounting for over half of the total emission reduction. Spatial analysis revealed that the majority of the reduction originated from the maize and interaction rows. Soil nitrate (NO3-) concentration emerged as the most critical factor influencing N2O flux, with NH4+ concentration also playing a significant role. Notably, straw incorporation did not increase N2O emissions from intercropping systems, while yield tended to increase, albeit not significantly. Conclusions: Maize/legume strip intercropping enhances nitrogen utilization, significantly mitigates N2O emissions, and boosts crop productivity; however, these effects remain consistent regardless of straw incorporation practices. Significance: This study highlights the advantages of maize/legume strip intercropping systems in reducing N2O emissions and its potential contribution to crop production.

AB Biochar application to agricultural fields is an effective carbon sequestration measure that has the potential to reduce N2O emissions and increase soil water holding capacity. However, the interaction mechanisms of biochar under deficit irrigation on N2O emissions remain unclear. A two-year field experiment is conducted in the Guanzhong Plain, China, in order to quantify the effects of biochar and deficit irrigation on N2O emissions from winter wheat-summer maize crop rotation and to investigate the potential mechanisms of nitrification and denitrification. According to the combination of biochar application and actual evapotranspiration-based irrigation scheduling, four treatments are designed (B1W100: biochar 30 .ha(-1) + ET; B1W80: biochar 30 t.ha(-1)+ 0.8 ET; B0W100: no biochar + ET; B0W80: no biochar + 0.8ET). The soil N2O flux, soil physical and chemical properties, and key functional gene abundance related to N2O emissions in nitrification and denitrification at different growth stages are investigated and discussed. Results show that the interaction between deficit irrigation and biochar significantly reduces soil N2O emissions. During the wheat and maize season, the application of biochar reduces the N2O emissions by an average of 12.9% and 15.2%, respectively. Deficit irrigation also reduces the N2O emissions by an average of 17.4% and 15.5%, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis shows that soil N2O is significantly correlated with soil water-filled pore space during the phase with intense N2O emissions. Soil functional gene abundance is determined at different growth stages for both wheat and maize. Maximum soil denitrification functional gene abundance is observed at the time when wheat and maize enter the stage of their peak growth at the jointing stage. With biochar addition and deficit irrigation, the abundance of nirK and nosZ genes increases and AOB amoA genes decreases. These results suggest that biochar with deficit irrigation is a better solution to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils.

AB Due to the heterogeneous nature of soil pore structure, processes such as nitrification and denitrification can occur simultaneously at microscopic levels, making prediction of small-scale nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the field notoriously difficult. We assessed N2O+N-2 emissions from soils under maize (Zea mays L.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and energy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), three potential bioenergy crops in order to identify the importance of different N2O sources to microsite production, and relate N2O source differences to crop-associated differences in pore structure formation. The combination of isotopic surveys of N2O in the field during one growing season and X-ray computed tomography (CT) enabled us to link results from isotopic mappings to soil structural properties. Further, our methodology allowed us to evaluate the potential for in situ N2O suppression by biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) in energy sorghum. Our results demonstrated that the fraction of N2O originating from bacterial denitrification and reduction of N2O to N-2 is largely determined by the volume of particulate organic matter occluded within the soil matrix and the anaerobic soil volume. Bacterial denitrification was greater in switchgrass than in the annual crops, related to changes in pore structure caused by the coarse root system. This led to high N-loses through N-2 emissions in the switchgrass system throughout the season a novel finding given the lack of data in the literature for total denitrification. Isotopic mapping indicated no differences in N2O-fluxes or their source processes between maize and energy sorghum that could be associated with the release of BNI by the investigated sorghum variety. The results of this research show how differences in soil pore structures among cropping systems can determine both N2O production via denitrification and total denitrification N losses in situ.

AB The impacts of different crop rotation systems with their corresponding management practices on grain yield, greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer nitrogen (N) and irrigation water use efficiencies are not well documented. This holds especially for the North China Plain which provides the staple food for hundreds of millions of people and where groundwater resources are polluted with nitrate and depleted through irrigation. Here, we report on fertilizer N and irrigation water use, grain yields, and nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions of conventional and optimized winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping systems, and of three alternative cropping systems, namely a winter wheat-summer maize (or soybean)-spring maize system, with three harvests in two years; and a single spring maize system with one crop per year. The results of this two-year study show that the optimized double-cropping system led to a significant increase in grain yields and a significant decrease in fertilizer N use and net greenhouse gas intensity, but the net greenhouse gas N2O emissions plus CH4 uptake and the use of irrigation water did not decrease relative to the conventional system. Compared to the conventional system the net greenhouse gas emissions, net greenhouse gas intensity and use of fertilizer N and irrigation water decreased in the three alternative cropping systems, but at the cost of grain yields except in the winter wheat-summer maize-spring maize system. Net uptake of CH4 by the soil was little affected by cropping system. Average N2O emission factors were only 0.17% for winter wheat and 0.53% for maize. In conclusion, the winter wheat-summer maize-spring maize system has considerable potential to decrease water and N use and decrease N2O emissions while maintaining high grain yields and sustainable use of groundwater.

AB The concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased considerably over the last century, but few studies are available showing their production from soils in semi-arid areas. Soils from the tropical semi-arid Central Depression of Chiapas were sampled from fields cultivated with maize (MAI treatment), under canopy of Acacia angustissima (TIMBRE) or outside the canopy of the trees (OUT), adjusted to 40%, 60%, 80% or 100% of water-holding capacity (WHC) and amended with 0, 15 or 50 mg (NH4NO3)-N kg(-1) dry soil. The production of N2O, CO2 and concentrations of NH4+, and NO3- were monitored in the laboratory under aerobic conditions. Production of N2O in the first 3 days was significantly larger from the MAI and OUT soils, compared to the TIMBRE soil, while the addition of 50 mg inorganic N doubled the production of N2O. In all treatments, soil at 100% WHC had the largest production of N2O. The emission of CO2 was significantly larger from soils at 60% and 80% WHC compared to the soil at 40% and 100% WHC, although the addition of inorganic N had no significant effect on CO2 emission. The application of inorganic N and the absence of vegetation increased the production of N2O. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intensive irrigation and nitrogen (N) fertilization are often linked to low N-fertilizer efficiency, and to high emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Efficient irrigation systems (e.g. subsurface drip irrigation [SDI]) combined with N-fertigation in a no-till agroecosystem can promote N-use efficiency, thereby curbing N2O emissions without depressing crop yield. Yet, crop type and SDI plant settings (and management) such as dripline spacing may determine the agronomic and environmental performance of SDI. In this two-year field study on maize (Zea mays L.) - soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) rotation with conservation agriculture management (notill and cover crops), we investigated the effects of three different irrigation/fertilization systems (SDI with a narrow dripline spacing (70 cm) + fertigation with ammonium sulphate, SDI with a large dripline spacing (140 cm) + fertigation with ammonium sulphate, and sprinkler irrigation [SPR] + granular urea application) on yield, N-fertilizer efficiency, and N2O emissions in a fine-textured soil. We hypothesized that SDI systems (especially with narrow dripline distance) would increase yield and mitigate N2O compared with SPR, and particularly for maize due to its higher water and nutrient demand. We found that SDI increased maize yield (+31%) and Nfertilizer efficiency (+43-71%). These positive results were only observed during the drier year in which irrigation supplied ca. 80% of maize water requirements. The narrower dripline spacing mitigated N2O emissions compared with sprinkler irrigation (by 44%) and with the wider spacing (by 36%), due to a more homogeneous distribution of N in soil, and to a lower soil moisture content. Soybean yield and N-use efficiency were not affected by the irrigation systems. We also found that SPR enhanced cover crop residue decomposition, thus promoting the release of C and N into the soil and increasing N2O emissions. Overall, our study provides important insights on key management decisions that define the sustainability of novel irrigation systems; in particular SDI with a 70 cm dripline distance should be promoted for maize to increase productivity and decrease N2O emissions in fine-textured soils.

AB China accounts for a third of global nitrogen fertilizer consumption. Under an International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 2 assessment, emission factors (EFs) are developed for the major crop,types using country-specific data. IPCC advises a separate calculation for the direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions of rice cultivation from that of cropland and the consideration of the water regime used for irrigation. In this paper we combine these requirements in two independent analyses, using different data quality acceptance thresholds, to determine the influential parameters on emissions with which to disaggregate and create N2O EFs. Across China, the N2O EF for lowland horticulture was slightly higher (between 0.74% and 1.26% of fertilizer applied) than that for upland crops (values ranging between 0.40% and 1.54%), and significantly higher than for rice (values ranging between 0.29% and 0.66% on temporarily drained soils, and between 0.15% and 0.37% on un-drained soils). Higher EFs for rice were associated with longer periods of drained soil and the use of compound fertilizer; lower emissions were associated with the use of urea or acid soils. Higher EFs for upland crops were associated with clay soil, compound fertilizer or maize crops; lower EFs were associated with sandy soil and the use of urea. Variation in emissions for lowland vegetable crops was closely associated with crop type. The two independent analyses in this study produced consistent disaggregated N2O EFs for rice and mixed crops, showing that the use of influential cropping parameters can produce robust EFs for China.

AB The remarkable expansion of fertilization and irrigation may stimulate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from cropping systems in northern China. High-resolution measurements were conducted in irrigated cotton and wheat-maize rotational systems in Shanxi Province, P.R. China, between 2007 and 2010 (three year-round crop cycles, hereinafter referred to as Y1, Y2 and Y3) to investigate the impacts of natural inter-annual variations and agricultural management on annual N2O emissions and direct emission factors (EFs). Overall, N2O emissions fluctuated diurnally, seasonally and inter-annually in the fertilized treatments. The hourly N2O fluxes closely followed the daily air temperature patterns. The daily mean fluxes corresponded to these hourly fluxes, which were observed between 09:00-10:00 and 19:00 -20:00. An optimized sampling protocol could improve the reliability of discrete measurements when estimating cumulative emissions. The N2O emissions for the fertilized treatments were 2.7 +/- 0.2 (Y1) and 1.6 +/- 0.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (Y2) from the cotton field and 6.2 +/- 0.4 (Y1), 4.5 +/- 0.3 (Y2) and 4.5 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (Y3) from the wheat-maize field. Peak N2O emissions after fertilization and irrigation/rainfall lasted one to three weeks and accounted for 16-55% of the annual emissions. Leaching losses were estimated at 10.4 +/- 3.0 (Y1) and 12.5 +/- 3.4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (Y2), which accounted for 16-17% of the fertilizer-N applied to the cotton field. Annual N2O emissions did not increase with increasing fertilization rates or water inputs because significant amounts of fertilizer-N were lost through leaching. Background emissions amounted to one-third to one-half of the total N2O emissions from the fertilized treatments. The direct EFs were 2.2 +/- 0.3% (Y1) and 0.9 +/- 0.2% (Y2) in the cotton field and 1.3 +/- 0.2% (Y1), 0.8 +/- 0.1% (Y2) and 0.7 +/- 0.1% (Y3) in the wheat-maize field. The large inter-annual variations in N2O emissions and direct EFs emphasize the importance of multiple-year continuous observations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous studies have shown that the use of zinc (Zn) chelate fertilizers combined with a nitrogen (N) fertilizer (urea) can lead to both agronomic (i.e., yields and Zn and N biofortification due to the synergies between both nutrients) and environmental (i.e., by reducing the emissions of nitrous oxide, N2O, derived from N fertilization) benefits under rainfed semi-arid conditions. However, little is known about the effect of Zn-N co-fertilization on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or soil microbial processes involved in N2O fluxes under non-flooded irrigated conditions (during the dry season). Under these conditions, water-filled pore space continuously fluctuates following a periodic pattern and soil temperatures are in the optimum range for soil microorganisms. In this context, a field experiment was conducted using a maize (Zea mays L.) crop treated with two N levels (no N application and 120 kg N ha(-1) as urea), and three Zn sources (no Zn application, Zn sulphate, and Zn applied with a mixture of chelating compounds, DTPA-HEDTA-EDTA). Nitrous oxide, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured using opaque chambers, as well as the total abundances of soil bacteria, archaea and nitrifier and denitrifier communities. Zn-N co-fertilization increased cumulative N2O emissions from 0.36 kg N-N2O ha(-1) (for urea combined with Zn chelates) to 0.76 kg N-N2O ha(-1) (for urea combined with Zn sulphate), with respect to urea without Zn application. The N2O emission factors were lower (0.34%-0.72%) than the IPCC default value of 1%. Total abundances of the nosZ denitrification gene, which is involved in the reduction in N2O to dinitrogen (N-2), were reduced by 75% on average in the plots that received Zn fertilizers. This reduction may explain the higher N2O emissions in these treatments. In contrast with the case with non-irrigated crops, Zn-N co-fertilization cannot be recommended as a strategy to mitigate N2O emissions in irrigated maize under semiarid conditions, despite of the enhancement of Zn availability in soil.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, vegetable yields, and soil microbial properties were studied in response to different rates of rice-straw biochar applied to an intensive vegetable soil (Ultisol) in South China. The study was conducted over a one-year period as a block-designed field experiment (n = 3) with two successive crops and five harvests in total. Biochar was applied at rates of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 Mg ha-1 and splits of nitrogen (N) fertilizer were added in the form of urea (1010 kg N in total). References without biochar and N fertilization were included. Biochar significantly decreased the cumulative annual N2O emissions by 34-67%, which concurred with decreased denitrification enzyme activity and increased nosZ gene abundance in the vegetable soil. The absolute N2O mitigation increased with increasing flux rates, which were positively correlated to soil temperature and water-filled pore space. Conversely, weak increases of N2O emissions were recurrently induced by biochar when the soil temperature was lower than 20 degrees C and the absolute fluxes were low. A significant 17-29% increase in vegetable yield was induced by biochar, which also ameliorated soil fertility by increasing the soil carbon content and the cation exchange capacity. Overall, biochar significantly decreased the yield-scaled N2O emissions by 44-71% with the lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions for the intermediate biochar application rate of 20 Mg ha(-1). Higher biochar application rates failed to further decrease the yield-scaled N2O emissions, but rather caused weak increases. Based on the present results, a biochar application rate of 20 Mg ha(-1) combined with N fertilization seemed to be recommendable to achieve highest vegetable yield with lowest N2O emissions in intensive vegetable production in South China.

AB The primary aims of this study were to (i) quantify the variations in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates under winter wheat-summer maize cropping systems in Guanzhong Plain and (ii) evaluate the impact of organic amendments on greenhouse gasmitigation over a long-term period. We measured N2O fluxes during the maize season in 2015 under four fertilizer regimes in a long-term fertilization experiment. Soil was treated with only synthetic fertilizers in the maize season and with synthetic fertilizers, synthetic fertilizers plus crop residues and synthetic fertilizers plus low and high levels of dairy manure in the winter wheat season from 1990. The SOC content (0-20 cm) was collected annually at the same site between 1990 and 2015. Synthesis of our measurements and previous observations (between 2000 and 2009) within the investigated agricultural landscape revealed that cumulative N2O emissions increased with the SOC content following natural logarithm models during both the maize and winter wheat seasons (r(2) > 0.77, p < 0.001), implying a trade-off between N2O emissions and SOC sequestration. The SOC content increased under all fertilizer regimes, and the dynamics were well fitted by the linear and logistic regression models (r(2) > 0.74, p < 0.001), indicating that all the fertilizer treatments in this study sequestered SOC. By applying these regression models, we estimated that the twomanure-amended treatments accumulated a negative global warming potential (ranging from - 1.9 to - 12.9 t CO2-equivalent ha(-1)) over the past 25 years. However, this benefit would most likely be offset by high N2O emissions at saturated SOC levels before 2020. Our estimates suggest that organic amendments may not be efficient for greenhouse gas mitigation in Guanzhong Plain over a long-term period. We recommend efforts to inhibit N2O production via denitrification as being critical to resolving the conflict between SOC sequestration and N2O emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil microbial biomass content, organic carbon mineralization as well as arginine ammonification rates were estimated in samples from arable and grassland soils and carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emission rates were measured in situ at four sites along a catena. Soil microbial biomass content increased in the order, maize monoculture < crop rotation < dry grassland < wet grassland. The two arable soils had similar rates of carbon mineralization in the laboratory at 22 degrees C (basal respiration) as well as in situ (carbon dioxide emission) at field temperature. Under crop rotation, maize monoculture and dry grassland, the arginine ammonification rate significantly correlated to the microbial biomass content. In contrast, the biomass-specific ammonification rate was low in wet grassland soil, as were in situ N2O emission rates. Data from all sites together revealed no general relationship between microbial biomass content and C and N mineralization rates. In addition, there was no general relationship between the quantity of soil microbial biomass and the emission rates of the greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O. The maize monoculture induced a soil microbial community that was less efficient in using organic carbon compounds, as shown by the high metabolic quotient (respiration rate per unit of biomass). However, microbial biomass content was proportional to basal respiration rate in soils under crop rotation, dry and wet grassland. Arginine ammonification rate was related to microbial biomass content only in fertilized soils. Applications of high quantities of inorganic nitrogen and farmyard manure apparently increase in situ N2O emission rates, particularly under crop rotation. The microbial biomass in the unfertilized wet grassland soil seems to be a sink for nitrogen.

AB Reducing mineral fertilizer application is an important management practice for mitigating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Crop straw and biochar are two farmer-friendly residues that can be used for reducing the application of mineral fertilizers. However, different effect of straw- and biochar-amended and non-amended soils on N2O emissions is not well understood. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment in a vegetable field in Southwestern China using four treatments: control (CT, no addition), solely mineral fertilizers at the recommended dosage (F), maize straw with mineral fertilizers (SF), and biochar with mineral fertilizers (BF), based on the same total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents. Soil N2O fluxes, cumulative N2O emission, soil chemical parameters, the abundance of N2O related microbial functional genes (amoA, nirS, nirK and nosZ) and microbial community structure were monitored and analyzed. Compared to F, the SF treatment increased the cumulative N2O emission. However, no significant difference was observed in cumulative N2O emission between F and BF treatments. Covariation in cumulative N2O emission and soil dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content indicated that heterotrophic ammonia oxidation fueled by soil DON might be the driving force for N2O production. Compared to F, both SF and BF treatments increased the amoA gene copy numbers of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) but reduced those of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA); nirS and nosZ gene copy numbers were also reduced under SF and BF treatments. Compared to SF, the diversity of nirK and nosZ communities under the BF treatment was increased, whereas the diversity of nirS community was decreased. Lower cumulative N2O emission under BF than that under SF may be attributed to lower N2O production from heterotrophic ammonia oxidation fueled by soil DON and increased N2O consumption mediated by nosZ-harboring denitrifiers.

AB Agricultural soils emit about 50% of the global flux of N2O attributable to human influence, mostly in response to nitrogen fertilizer use. Recent evidence that the relationship between N2O fluxes and N-fertilizer additions to cereal maize are non-linear provides an opportunity to estimate regional N2O fluxes based on estimates of N application rates rather than as a simple percentage of N inputs as used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We combined a simple empirical model of N2O production with the SOCRATES soil carbon dynamics model to estimate N2O and other sources of Global Warming Potential (GWP) from cereal maize across 19,000 cropland polygons in the North Central Region (NCR) of the US over the period 1964-2005. Results indicate that the loading of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere from cereal maize production in the NCR was 1.7 Gt CO(2)e, with an average 268 t CO(2)e produced per tonne of grain. From 1970 until 2005, GHG emissions per unit product declined on average by 2.8 t CO(2)e ha(-1) annum(-1), coinciding with a stabilisation in N application rate and consistent increases in grain yield from the mid-1970's. Nitrous oxide production from N fertilizer inputs represented 59% of these emissions, soil C decline (0-30 cm) represented 11% of total emissions, with the remaining 30% (517 Mt) from the combustion of fuel associated with farm operations. Of the 126 Mt of N fertilizer applied to cereal maize from 1964 to 2005, we estimate that 2.2 Mt N was emitted as N2O when using a non-linear response model, equivalent to 1.75% of the applied N.

AB Feeding management represents an opportunity to improve cattle performance in grazing-based production systems and to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock production. However, it is unclear how diet affects GHG emissions from dung patches left by grazing cattle. In this study, we evaluated the impact of supplementing the diet of grazing beef steers with maize grain on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from dung patches, and estimated the corresponding emission factors (EF). Gas fluxes from dung and soil were monitored over 125 days, using the static chamber technique. Dung from supplemented grazing steers produced significantly lower CH4 and higher N2O emissions (1.7 g CH4-C/m(2) and 0.4 g N2O-N/m(2)) than dung from non-supplemented steers (4.0 g CH4-C/m(2) and 0.1 g N2O-N/m(2)). Total GHG emissions from dung showed a tendency to be lower with maize grain supplementation (47.8 and 63.5 +/- 5.9 g CO2eq/head/d for supplemented and non-supplemented steers, respectively). The EF values (0.8 g CH4/kg volatile solids (VS) and 0.09 % N2O) were lower than the default values established by IPCC (2006), but comparable to those established by IPCC (2019). Thus, the IPCC (2019) EF values should be used for GHG inventories in the study region (Argentina) until more region-specific values are obtained. Using local data, this study showed that supplementing the diet of grazing steers can reduce dung GHG emissions. Further studies are needed to assess the full implications of dietary supplementation on GHG emissions at farm level.

AB The closed chamber method was used to measure the N2O and CH4 emissions from rice, maize, soybean and spring wheat fields in Northeast China. Rice field almost did not emit or deposit N2O in total during flooding period, whereas N2O was substantially emitted during non-flooding period. The annual emission amount of N2O was 1.70 kg N2O ha(-1), but that in flooding period was only 0.04 kg N2O ha(-1). Daily average and seasonal total CH4 emission in rice field were 0.07 and 7.40 g CH(4)m(-2), respectively. A trade-off between N2O and CH4 emissions from rice field was found. The growth of Azolla in rice field greatly stimulated both N2O and CH4 emissions. Total N2O emissions (270 days) from maize and soybean fields were 7.10 and 3.12 kg N2O ha(-1), respectively. The sink function of the uplands monitored as the atmospheric CH4 was not significant.

AB Conservation agriculture, which involves minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover, and crop rotation, has been widely adopted as a sustainable agricultural practice globally. However, the effects of conservation agriculture practices on soil N2O emissions and crop yield vary based on geography, management methods, and the duration of implementation, which has hindered its widespread scientific application. In this study, we assessed the impacts of no-tillage (NT), both individually and in combination with other conservation agriculture principles, on soil N2O emissions and crop yields worldwide, based on 1270 observations from 86 peer-reviewed articles. Our results showed that conservation agriculture practices significantly increased crop yield by 9.1% while significantly reducing soil N2O emissions by 6.8% compared to conventional tillage (CT). These mitigation effects were even greater when NT was combined with other conservation agriculture principles, such as crop residue retention and crop rotation, leading to reductions in N2O emissions of over 15% and yield increases of more than 30%. Additionally, conservation agriculture was more effective at mitigating soil N2O emissions in dry climates compared to humid regions. Long-term adoption of conservation agriculture practices was found to reduce soil N2O emissions by up to 26% without compromising crop yields. Smallholder farm in Central Asia, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa appear particularly suitable for the adoption of conservation agriculture, whereas, in humid climates, high nitrogen (N) input management and silt-clay loam soil should be applied with caution. Overall, conservation agriculture holds significant potential for mitigating soil N2O emissions while enhancing grain yields in cereal cropping systems.

AB Seasonal soil freeze-thaw events may enhance soil nitrogen transformation and thus stimulate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in cold regions. However, the mechanisms of soil N2O emission during the freeze-thaw cycling in the field remain unclear. We evaluated N2O emissions and soil biotic and abiotic factors in maize and paddy fields over 20 months in Northeast China, and the structural equation model (SEM) was used to determine which factors affected N2O production during non-growing season. Our results verified that the seasonal freeze-thaw cycles mitigated the available soil nitrogen and carbon limitation during spring thawing period, but simultaneously increased the gaseous N2O-N losses at the annual time scale under field condition. The N2O-N cumulative losses during the non-growing season amounted to 0.71 and 0.55 kg N ha(-1) for the paddy and maize fields, respectively, and contributed to 66 and 18% of the annual total. The highest emission rates (199.2-257.4 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) were observed during soil thawing for both fields, but we did not observe an emission peak during soil freezing in early winter. Although the pulses of N2O emission in spring were short-lived (18 d), it resulted in approximately 80% of the non-growing season N2O-N loss. The N2O burst during the spring thawing was triggered by the combined impact of high soil moisture, flush available nitrogen and carbon, and rapid recovery of microbial biomass. SEM analysis indicated that the soil moisture, available substrates including NH4+ and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) explained 32, 36, 16 and 51% of the N2O flux variation, respectively, during the non-growing season. Our results suggested that N2O emission during the spring thawing make a vital contribution of the annual nitrogen budget, and the vast seasonally frozen and snow-covered croplands will have high potential to exert a positive feedback on climate change considering the sensitive response of nitrogen biogeochemical cycling to the freeze-thaw disturbance.

AB Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) is a concept that includes the management of organic matter in smallholder farming systems for sustainable intensification. To determine whether ISFM is also eco-efficient, we measured and simulated nitrogen (N)-dynamics and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in an ISFM long-term maize trial in Western Kenya. The total annual N-balance averaged over 10.5 years was negative for all continuous maize treatments that received only inorganic N-fertilizer. The N-balance was zero or positive when maize was grown in rotation with the green manure cover crop, Tephrosia candid, and/or to which 4 Mg ha(-1) sea-son(-1) farm yard manure (FYM) added. These results thus substantiate the importance of organic matter management in tropical ecosystems. They also underpin that mineral N-fertilizer application alone does not guarantee agro-ecosystem sustainability, which should be considered in fertilizer (subsidy) policies. Treatments that included Tephrosia and FYM application emitted the largest amounts of N2O. Highest emissions (12.0 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) were simulated for the maize-Tephrosia rotation to which FYM and 30 kg ha(-1) of mineral fertilizer N was added and 2 Mg ha(-1) maize stovers retained. Such treatments had the highest N-emission intensity. The slope of the linear regression equation describing the N2O emission-N-input relationship of all considered treatments (0.023) was twice as high as the IPCC-Tier-1 emission factor. Maize-Tephrosia treatments had the highest seasonal maize yields. These were, however, not high enough to compensate for the inclusion of Tephrosia into the system as compared to growing maize continuously, compromising adoption by smallholder farmers.

AB The area used for bioenergy feedstock production is increasing because substitution of fossil fuels by bioenergy is promoted as an option to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, agriculture itself contributes to rising atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) concentrations. In this study we tested whether the net exchanges of N2O and CH4 between soil and atmosphere differ between annual fertilized and perennial unfertilized bioenergy crops. We measured N2O and CH4 soil fluxes from poplar short rotation coppice (SRC), perennial grass-clover and annual bioenergy crops (silage maize, oilseed rape, winter wheat) in two central German regions for two years. In the second year after establishment, the N2O emissions were significantly lower in SRC (<0.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) than grassland (0.8 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and the annual crop (winter wheat; 1.5 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) at one regional site (Reiffenhausen). However, a different trend was observed in the first year when contents of mineral nitrogen were still higher in SRC due to former cropland use. At the other regional site (Gierstadt), N2O emissions were generally low (<0.5.kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and no crop-type effects were detected. Net uptake of atmospheric CH4 varied between 0.4 and 1.2 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) with no consistent crop-type effect. The N2O emissions related to gross energy in the harvested biomass ranged from 0.07 to 6.22 kg CO2 equ GJ(-1). In both regions, Gierstadt (low N2O emissions) and more distinct Reiffenhausen (medium N2O emissions), this energy yield-related N2O emission was the lowest for SRC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fertilizer and water management practices have short- and long-term effects on soil chemical and physical properties and, in turn, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The goal of this 4-yr field study was to establish the relationships between soil properties, agronomic practices, and GHG (CO2 and N2O) emissions under different fertilizer and water table management practices. There were two fertilizer treatments: inorganic fertilizer (IF) and a mix of solid cattle manure and inorganic fertilizer (SCM), combined with tile drainage(DR) and controlled drainage with subirrigation(CDS). The cropping system was a maize (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. Nitrogen in biomass (BMN) and N in grain (GRN) were measured and used to calculate other plant N parameters. Nitrous oxide and CO2 fluxes were collected weekly, and their respective cumulative emissions were calculated. The results show that soil organic matter (OM), soil total carbon (C), and soil total nitrogen (N) were greater in SCM than IF by 23.7, 35.2, and 24.4%, respectively. Water table management did not significantly affect soil N and C. Increased CO2 emissions were witnessed under higher soil OM, soil total C, and total N. Plant N uptake parameters were negatively correlated with N2O and CO2 emissions. Higher plant N uptake can reduce environmental pollution by limiting N2O and CO2 emissions.

AB Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) over croplands are a major source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The precise accounting of sources of N2O is essential to national and global budgets, as well as the understanding of the spatial and temporal relationships with environmental variables such as rainfall, air and soil temperature, and soil moisture. The objective of this work was to investigate the temporal correlations of N2O fluxes with soil and air temperatures, as well as soil moisture. N2O fluxes were measured over four biofuel crops in Central Illinois during their establishment phase. Measurements were carried out from 2009 to 2011 using a trace gas analyzer (TGA) with tunable laser technology. Measurements of concentrations of N2O and CO(2)were taken at the center of four plots of maize/soybean rotation, miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and a mixture of native prairie plants. Cumulative fluxes indicate an average emission of nitrogen via N2O fluxes on the order of 1.5 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), in agreement with chamber measurements previously reported for the site. N2O fluxes were associated with peaks in soil and air temperature, and soil moisture, particularly during spring and winter thaws. Cross-wavelet analysis was used to investigate the correlation between N2O fluxes and those variables. Results indicate that N2O fluxes and meteorological variables have significant covariance in time scales ranging from 4 to 32 days. In addition, temporal delays of 1-8 days were found in those relationships. Cross-wavelet patterns were similar when relating N2O fluxes with soil temperature, air temperature and soil moisture. The temporal patterns of fluxes and environmental variables reported here support the modeling of emissions and highlight the importance of considering the timing of fluxes in relation to trends in meteorological variables.

AB Biochar application and irrigation management are widely regarded as effective strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural systems. However, the combined effects of these two approaches on greenhouse gas emissions remain insufficiently understood. This study investigated how different biochar application rates and irrigation strategies affect soil moisture and temperature, as well as the relationship between soil moisture, temperature, and greenhouse gas emissions. A two-year field experiment was conducted in the North China Plain to investigate the combined impact of deficit irrigation and biochar on greenhouse gas emissions in a summer maize-winter wheat rotation system. The experiment included three irrigation strategies (full irrigation (F: 70 %-80 % field capacity (theta(fc))), deficit irrigation (D: 50 %-60 % theta(fc)) during the jointing stage of maize and wheat (DJ), and deficit irrigation during the jointing stage and filling stage of maize and wheat (D-J+F)) and 3 biochar application rates (T: 0 t ha(-1) biochar, M: 15 t ha(-1) biochar, and H: 30 t ha(-1) biochar). The results showed that water-filled pore space (WFPS) and soil temperature were positively correlated with CO2 and N2O emission fluxes but had no significant relationship with CH4 emission flux. Decreasing irrigation and increasing biochar application led to a reduction in cumulative soil CO2 and N2O emissions, alongside an increase in CH4 absorption. The interaction between deficit irrigation and biochar application effectively reduced overall soil greenhouse gas emissions. Under high biochar application (H), deficit irrigation during the jointing stage of maize and wheat decreased the global warming potential by 15.9 %, with a minimal yield loss of only 4.86 %. These findings suggest that targeted deficit irrigation, combined with biochar application, is a promising strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while minimizing crop yield losses.

AB Biochar-bioenergy coproduction from biomass pyrolysis has the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation. Biochar produced at various pyrolysis temperatures (<600 degrees C) has been widely studied. However, the effect of biochars, produced at high pyrolysis temperature (>= 600 degrees C), on soil nitrogen (N) dynamics and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission is largely unknown. A pot trial was performed to examine the effect of high pyrolysis temperature (600, 700, 850 and 950 degrees C) woody biochars on soil N dynamics, microbial gene abundance and N2O emissions with (+N) and without N (-N) fertilization from an acid soil. Results showed that all biochar treatments significantly lowered the N2O emissions in both fertilized and unfertilized regimes. However, the suppressive effect on N2O emission among different high pyrolysis temperatures was not statistically different. Biochar amendment significantly decreased the concentration of soil NH4+, and lower levels of soil NO3- were observed at the later stage of experiment. Under -N, plant biomass and N uptake were significantly lowered in all biochar treatments. Under +N, biochar addition significantly increased plant biomass, while only the 700 degrees C biochar significantly increased N uptake. This suggests that single application of biochar could limit soil mineral N bioavailability and further decrease plant growth and N uptake in the plant-soil system. Biochar amendments tended to increase nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) gene abundance, but this effect was only significant for biochar produced at 950 degrees C under +N. In conclusion, high pyrolysis temperature biochars can be effectively used to reduce N2O emission, while increases in nosZ gene abundance and decreases in NH4+ and NO3- concentrations in the acid soil are likely to be responsible for the reduction in N2O emission. Thus, woody biochars as a by-product produced at high pyrolysis temperature have the potential to mitigate soil N2O emission via modifying N transformation and further affect climate change.

AB Two field sites on a loam soil were established to monitor N2O concentration in the soil atmosphere and rate of emission from the soil surface. The sites were cropped to maize (Zea mays L.) and managed at two high-N levels (181 or 237 kg N ha-1). Both sites received 168 kg N ha-1 as feedlot cattle (Bos taurus) manure (preplant-incorporated) and 13 kg N ha-1 as NH4NO3 fertilizer in the row at planting. One site (Site B) received additional soil-incorporated N (56 kg N ha-1) as  urea. Flucturations in N2O emissions from the two sites were temporally similar, and differed only in magnitude with Site A (no additional fertilizer), emitting about 3.6 kg N20-N ha-1 yr-1 and Site B about 5.2 kg N2)-N ha-1 yr-1, or about 2% of the N applied. Most of the N2O was emitted between mid-June and the end of July when the soil was warm and NH4+-N was present, and at spring thaw (late March the following year) when soils wee cold and near water-saturated. High N2O emissions during the growing season occurred following precipitation events, and hence were associated with high soil water and probably with the initiation of soil drying. Nitrous oxide production was continuous during winter months, presumably a result of denitrification. The N2O concentration in the profile of the frozen soil increased to high levels (nearly 2000 .mu.L L-1 N2O at Site B) before spring thaw. At thaw, nearly 330 d after application of the N amendments, an apparent physical  release period occurred and N2O flux was far higher (about 50 g N2O-N ha-1 d-1) than at most times during the growing season.

TI Greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, N2O and CH4) of pea and maize during two

AB Agriculture contributes considerably to the increase of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Hence, magnitude and drivers of temporal variations in carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in croplands are urgently needed to develop sustainable, climate-smart agricultural practices. However, our knowledge of GHG fluxes from croplands is still very limited. The eddy covariance technique was used to quantify GHG budgets and N2O emis-sion factors (EF) for pea and maize in Switzerland. The random forest technique was applied for gap-filling N2O and CH4 fluxes as well as to determine the relevance of environmental, vegetation vs. management drivers of the GHG fluxes during two cropping seasons. Environmental (i.e., net radiation, soil water content, soil temperature) and veg-etation drivers (i.e., vegetation height) were more important drivers for GHG fluxes at field scale than time since man-agement for the two crop species. Both crops acted as GHG sinks between sowing and harvest, clearly dominated by net CO2 fluxes, while CH4 emissions were negligible. However, considerable N2O emissions occurred in both crop fields early in the season when crops were still establishing. N2O fluxes in both crops were small later in the season when vegetation was tall, despite high soil water contents and temperatures. Results clearly show a strong and highly dynamic microbial-plant competition for N driving N2O fluxes at the field scale. The total loss was 1.4 kg N2O-N ha-1 over 55 days for pea and 4.8 kg N2O-N ha-1 over 127 days for maize. EFs of N2O were 1.5 % (pea) and 4.4 % (maize) during the cropping seasons, clearly exceeding the IPCC Tier 1 EF for N2O. Thus, sustainable, climate-smart agriculture needs to consider crop phenology and better adapt N supply to crop N demand for growth, particularly during the early cropping season when competition for N between establishing crops and soil microorganisms modulates N2O losses.

AB Human intervention in agriculture, such as tillage and fertilization, could result in major changes of N2O emissions that understanding the N2O emission mechanism is of great significance in reducing the N2O emissions of the agricultural system. In this work, we focused on the conventional tillage practice and straw return practice used in the spring maize production system of this region and compared them by the addition of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to explore the N2O emission mechanism of the farmland. Compared with conventional farming, straw return significantly increased the N2O emissions from the soil. Soil pH had important effects on soil N2O emissions through its influence on the ammonia oxidizer community. In addition, DMPP was used to distinguish N2O emissions driven by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and the results showed that AOB were the dominant factor regulating N2O emissions after receiving nitrogen from an external source in dryland farming calcareous soil. Through the analyses of soil AOB community composition and the aggregated boosted tree (ABT) model for N2O emissions, Nitrosospira Cluster 3a.2 was found to be the main driving force of soil N2O emissions in AOB communities. These findings will help better understand the physiochemical and biological mechanisms underlying the N2O emissions of agricultural soils and provide insight for reducing the negative impact of agricultural production systems on the ecological environment.

AB Fertilized agricultural soil is a significant source of gaseous nitrogen compounds (GNCs), including N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3. The North China Plain (NCP) is the "hot region" for the release of these GNCs due to intensive fertilization practices. However, existing research has primarily focused on N2O emissions from fertilized farmland in the NCP, lacking comprehensive observational studies on other GNCs. Therefore, a continuous cumulative sampling technique (open-top dynamic chamber system) was utilized in this study to simultaneously measure the exchange fluxes of N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3 over summer maize-winter wheat rotation fields in the NCP. Results showed that GNC emissions from the soil displayed distinct diurnal variations, with higher emissions during the day attributed to elevated soil temperature. However, N2O emissions remained consistent between day and night, potentially influenced not only by soil temperature but also by soil humidity. Annual cumulative emissions and emission factors (EFs) for four GNCs were determined, indicating that N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions during the maize season were 1.38-2.37 times higher than those during the wheat season, with 98 % of HONO emissions occurring in the maize season. Additionally, the study first presented the annual HONO EFs of 0.36 +/- 0.03 % in fertilized farmland. Furthermore, a comparison revealed that the fluxes of N2O, NO, NH3, and HONO using the conventional single-point sampling method were 26.4 %, 13.9 %, and 8.10 % lower, and 7.86 % higher compared to the continuous cumulative sampling method recommended in this study. In general, this study provided precise measurements of GNC emissions from farmland, offering essential foundational data for modeling parameters and contributing to the formulation of regional air pollution prevention and control policies.

AB The assessment of nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from agricultural soil surfaces still poses a major challenge to the scientific community. The evaluations of integrated soil fluxes of N2O are difficult owing to their lower emissions when compared with CO2. These emissions are also sporadic as environmental conditions act as a limiting factor. A station prototype was developed to integrate annual N2O andCO(2) emissions using an automatic chamber technique and infrared spectrometers within the LIFE project (IPNOA: LIFE11 ENV/IT/00032). It was installed from June 2014 to October 2015 in an experimental maize field in Tuscany. The detection limits for the fluxes were evaluated up to 1.6 ng N-N2O m(2) s(-1) and 0.3 mu g CCO2 m(2) s(-1). A cross-comparison carried out in September 2015 with the Bmobile IPNOA prototype<^>; a highsensibility transportable instrument already validated provided evidence of very similar values and highlighted flux assessment limitations according to the gas analyzers used. The permanent monitoring device showed that temporal distribution of N2O fluxes can be very large and discontinuous over short periods of less than 10 days and that N2O fluxes were below the detection limit of the instrumentation during approximately 70% of the measurement time. The N2O emission factors were estimated to 1.9% in 2014 and 1.7% in 2015, within the range of IPCC assessments.

AB Due to its lower water requirement, methane emission and soil degradation, a maize-wheat rotation (MWR) may be a more attractive alternative to rice-wheat rotation (RWR), in the upper Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) of India. However, N2O emission from MWR needs to be quantified to propose management practices for N2O mitigation. A field experiment was conducted at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-IARI), New Delhi, to assess the impacts of various N sources on N2O emission and its mitigation from the MWR. Six treatments -N0 (control), urea, urea + farmyard manure (FYM), FYM, urea + nitrification inhibitor (NI) and neem oil coated urea (NOCU) were investigated during 2012-2014. Results show ranges of N2O-N emissions from MWR of 0.59-0.69, 1.82-1.86, 1.81-1.85, 1.71-1.77, 1.38-1.52, 1.57-1.61 during 2012-2013, and of 0.62-0.68, 1.86-1.90, 1.78-1.84, 1.72-1.76, 1.40-1.46, 1.52-1.60 during 2013-2014, for N0, urea, urea + FYM, FYM, urea + NI and NOCU treatments, respectively. The 2-year pooled N2O-N emission of MWR decreased by 23% in urea + NI and by 16% in NOCU with higher grain yield as compared to conventional urea application. Application of FYM with urea and FYM alone also reduced N2O-N emission; however, the grain yields of these treatments were decreased. Thus, the study suggests that the application of NOCU and NI with urea can mitigate N2O-N emissions from the maize and wheat crops. Hence, the use of NOCU and application of NI with urea could be a better option to mitigate N2O-N emissions from MWR of the upper IGP of India.

AB In a study on the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from maize production in South-West Germany, N2O emissions where measured with an automated chamber system over two consecutive cropping seasons, including an intermediate fallow period. Urea-based fertilizer treatments included a fertilizer only control (U), as well as the use of pyraclostrobin, which showed inhibitory effects on denitrification in a laboratory experiment. Pyraclostrobin was used alone (U + P) and in combination with a NBPT/NPPT urease inhibitor (UI + P) and a reduced fertilizer rate (70% UI + P). The U control emitted 1.03 +/- 0.22 and 1.94 +/- 0.61 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the cropping seasons of 2012 and 2013, respectively. Fallow emissions mainly occurred after a soil freeze-thaw period and were 0.24 +/- 0.08, 0.23 +/- 0.09, 0.22 +/- 0.06, 0.32 +/- 0.21 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for U, 70% UI + P, U + P and UI + P, respectively. In the cropping season 2012, no effects of the UI + P and U + P treatments could be observed. In 2013, UI + P increased N2O emissions by 13% when compared to the U control, while a significant reduction of 24% was observed for the U + P treatment. The 70% UI + P treatment resulted in significantly lower (similar to 30%) N2O emissions and only slight reductions (7-10%) of grain yields in both years. Climate conditions varied strongly between seasons (416 and 704 mm total rainfall in 2012 and 2013, respectively) which most likely also influenced the performance of the inhibitors. Direct emission factors (EFd%) also increased strongly in 2013 (0.28 +/- 0.12 in 2012 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.41 in 2013 for U) but were generally lower than the 1% IPCC default value. Values for nitrogen recovery efficiency and yield-scaled N2O emissions were most preferable for the 70% UI + P treatment and indicate that reduced fertilizer rates in combination with inhibitors could represent a viable means for N2O mitigation without significant yield penalties in agricultural systems.

AB Earthworm activity is known to increase emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from arable soils. Earthworm gut, casts, and burrows have exhibited higher denitrification activities than the bulk soil, implicating priming of denitrifying organisms as a possible mechanism for this effect. Furthermore, the earthworm feeding strategy may drive N2O emissions, as it determines access to fresh organic matter for denitrification. Here, we determined whether interactions between earthworm feeding strategy and the soil denitrifier community can predict N2O emissions from the soil. We set up a 90-day mesocosm experiment in which N-15-labeled maize (Zea mays L.) was either mixed in or applied on top of the soil in the presence or absence of the epigeic earthworm Lumbricus rubellus and/or the endogeic earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa. We measured N2O fluxes and tested the bulk soil for denitrification enzyme activity and the abundance of 16S rRNA and denitrifier genes nirS and nosZ through real-time quantitative PCR. Compared to the control, L. rubellus increased denitrification enzyme activity and N2O emissions on days 21 and 90 (day 21, P = 0.034 and P = 0.002, respectively; day 90, P = 0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively), as well as cumulative N2O emissions (76%; P = 0.014). A. caliginosa activity led to a transient increase of N2O emissions on days 8 to 18 of the experiment. Abundance of nosZ was significantly increased (100%) on day 90 in the treatment mixture containing L. rubellus alone. We conclude that L. rubellus increased cumulative N2O emissions by affecting denitrifier community activity via incorporation of fresh residue into the soil and supplying a steady, labile carbon source.

AB Irrigation management is one of most critical factors influencing soil N2O and CO2 emissions in dryland agriculture. To explore the effects of irrigation systems and levels on the mitigation of N2O and CO2 emissions from maize fields and to determine the balance among greenhouse gases (GHG) emission, water-saving and grain yield, a two-year field exper-iment was conducted in the North China Plain (NCP) during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019. Two irrigation systems (i.e., flood irrigation, FI, and drip irrigation, DI) were adopted with four irrigation levels in each system, including 65 mm/event (sufficient irrigation, CK), 50 mm/event (decreased by 23 %), 35 mm/event (by 46 %) and 20 mm/event (by 69 %), respectively. The results showed that both irrigation systems and levels had significant effects on soil N2O and CO2 emissions (P < 0.05). Nitrous oxide (N2O) and CO2 emissions peaked following irrigation or irri-gation + fertilization events during sowing to early filling stage (R1), with the peak values increasing with irrigation levels. Meanwhile, peak values from FI were higher than those from DI at 50 mm and 65 mm irrigation levels. The average cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions of DI treatments were 14.9 % and 6.23 % lower than those of FI treatments (P < 0.05), respectively. Soil moisture was identified as one of the most crucial factors influencing N2O and CO2 fluxes. Deficit irrigation efficiently deceased cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions, but moderate to severe deficit irrigation brought significant reduction in grain yield. Drip irrigation with a slight deficit irrigation level (decreased by 23 %) obtained the best economic and environmental benefits, which achieved the dual goal of lower GHG emissions but higher WUE without sacrificing grain yield.

AB Agricultural ecosystems are major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). An important method of investigating GHG emissions in agricultural ecosystems is model simulation. Field measurements quantifying N2O and CO2 fluxes were taken in a summer maize ecosystem in Zhangye City, Gansu Province, in northwestern China in 2010. Observed N2O and CO2 fluxes were used for validating flux predictions by a DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model. Then sensitivity tests on the validated DNDC model were carried out on three variables: climatic factors, soil properties and agricultural management. Results indicated that: (1) the factors that N2O emissions were sensitive to included nitrogen fertilizer application rate, manure amendment and residue return rate; (2) CO2 emission increased with increasing manure amendment, residue return rate and initial soil organic carbon (SOC); and (3) net global warming potential (GWP) increased with increasing N fertilizer application rate and decreased with manure amendment, residue return rate and precipitation increase. Simulation of the long-term impact on SOC, N2O and net GWP emissions over 100 yr of management led to the conclusion that increasing residue return rate is a more efficient method of mitigating GHG emission than increasing fertilizer N application rate in the study area.

AB The DNDC, LandscapeDNDC and IAP-N-GAS models have been designed to simulate the carbon and nitrogen processes of terrestrial ecosystems. Until now, a comparison of these models using simultaneous observations has not been reported, although such a comparison is essential for further model development and application. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the models, delineate the strengths and limitations of each model for simulating soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, and explore short-comings of these models that may require reconsideration. We conducted comparisons among the models using simultaneous observations of both gases and relevant variables from the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system at three field sites with calcareous soils. Simulations of N2O and NO emissions by the three models agreed well with annual observations, but not with daily observations. All models failed to correctly simulate soil moisture, which could explain some of the incorrect daily fluxes of N2O and NO, especially for intensive fluxes during the growing season. Multi-model ensembles are promising approaches to better simulate daily gas emissions. IAP-N-GAS underestimated the priming effect of straw incorporation on N2O and NO emissions, but better results were obtained with DNDC95 and LandscapeDNDC. LandscapeDNDC and IAP-N-GAS need to improve the simulation of irrigation water allocation and residue decomposition processes, respectively, and together to distinguish different irrigation methods as DNDC95 does. All three models overestimated the emissions of the nitrogenous gases for high nitrogen fertilizer (>430 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) addition treatments, and therefore, future research should focus more on the simulation of the limitation of soil dissolvable organic carbon on denitrification in calcareous soils.

AB In the North China Plain (NCP), urea is applied to predominantly high-pH soils and high gaseous losses of N are observed in the forms of ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The production of N2O and N-2 is further stimulated by the addition of fresh organic materials. The urease inhibitor (UI) N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) restricts the loss of N by reducing the rate of urea hydrolysis and limiting the substrates for NH3 and N2O emission. We investigated the turnover of N-as well as the emissions of NH3, N2O and CO2-as affected by the addition of wheat straw and urea +NBPT in an incubation experiment using soil from a farmer's field, typical for the NCP. Added wheat straw prolonged the persistence of NH4+ after the application of both urea and urea +NBPT, while reducing the formation of nitrate. Wheat straw may therefore either act as a stimulant of hydrolysis or as an inhibitor of nitrification. Urea increased soil respiration and the emission of N2O, possibly acting as a primer for microbial activity as described in earlier studies. In combination with the application of organic C sources, this effect of urea may be a main driver of gaseous N loss.

AB Nitrous oxide is a significant greenhouse gas (GHG) contributor in crop production, yet detailed documentation, including crop yields and specific emission factors (EFd d of N2O), 2 O), are lacking for the North China Plain. A six-year (2016-2022) diversified crop rotation experiment in this region examined GHG emissions from eight crops (sweet potato, peanut, soybean, spring maize, sweet sorghum, ryegrass, summer maize, and winter wheat) and fallow seasons. The results revealed that summer maize had the highest cumulative soil N2O 2 O emissions (5.07 kg N ha- 1 ), with an average flux value of 225.3 mu g N2O-N 2 O-N m- 2 h- 1 during the growing season. Summer maize emitted 16-75 % more N2O 2 O than spring crops and winter wheat and 85-86 % more than ryegrass (cover crop) and the winter fallow season. All eight crops acted as weak net CH4 4 sinks. Annual average CO2-equivalents 2-equivalents of N2O 2 O and CH4 4 emissions reflected N2O 2 O emissions from all crops and fallow seasons. In addition, GHG footprint metrics (GFa, a , per unit area; GFy, y , per kg equivalent yield; GFb, b , per kg biomass; GFe, e , per unit economic benefit) based on life cycle assessment thinking showed that intensive cereal crops (winter wheat and summer maize) had the highest GHG footprints, while sweet potato had the lowest due to its greater biomass and lower N input. Other crops had 19-90 % lower GHG footprints than wheat and maize. Furthermore, we also quantified specific- crop EFd d of N2O, 2 O, with ryegrass having the lowest EFd d (0.48 f 0.02 %), followed by winter wheat (0.81 f 0.43 %), and other crops ranging from 1.00 f 0.13 % to 2.36 f 0.85 %. This study provides important emissions data for different crops and winter fallow periods, enhancing our understanding of GHG footprints and emission factors, which are essential for the advancement of sustainable agriculture practices.

AB Oxygen (O-2) plays a critical and yet poorly understood role in regulating nitrous oxide (N2O) production in well-structured agricultural soils. We investigated the effects of in situ O-2 dynamics on N2O production in a typical intensively managed Chinese cropping system under a range of environmental conditions (temperature, moisture, ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and so forth). Climate and management (fertilization, irrigation, precipitation, and temperature), and their interactions significantly affected soil O-2 and N2O concentrations (P < 0.05). Soil O-2 concentration was the most significant factor correlating with soil N2O concentration (r = -0.71) when compared with temperature, water-filled pore space, and ammonium concentration (r = 0.30, 0.25, and 0.26, respectively). Soil N2O concentration increased exponentially with decreasing soil O-2 concentrations. The exponential model of N treatments and fertilization with irrigation/precipitation events predicted 74-90% and 58% of the variance in soil N2O concentrations, respectively. Our results highlight that the soil O-2 status is the proximal, direct, and the most decisive environmental trigger for N2O production, outweighing the effects of other factors and could be a key variable integrating the aggregated effects of various complex interacting variables. This study offers new opportunities for developing more sensitive approaches to predicting and through appropriate management interventions mitigating N2O emissions from agricultural soils.

AB Large amounts of nitrogen fertilizers have been applied into China's croplands to ensure adequate crop production, leading to massive direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from cropland soils. Since 1980, the agricultural direct N2O emissions in China have shown sustained and impressive growth, associated with the expansion of croplands and intensified fertilization practices. However, it remains uncertain how direct N2O emissions have responded to recent agricultural policies characterized by reducing N fertilizer use and adjusting crop mix. This lack of clarity limits practical insights into the effectiveness of these policies. To fill this gap, we here provided a more detailed and timely assessment of crop-specific N2O emissions during 1980-2022 based on a comprehensive N2O-emission factor dataset and the random forest algorithm. The resulting estimation exhibited a longterm average of 174.7 Gg N2O-N yr-1, with 46 % of it contributed by staple crops (rice, maize and wheat) and 44 % from three cash crops (vegetables, fruit and tea). The temporal sequences revealed a noticeable increase over 1980-2015, peaking in 2015 at 259.9 Gg N2O-N yr-1, followed by a subsequent decline to 215.3 Gg N2O-N yr-1 by 2022. The divergent trends of N2O emissions were observed countrywide, with the turning point at 2015 recognized across more than three-quarter croplands. N application was identified as the fundamental driver for this temporal trajectory, especially the decline after 2015. This study affirms the great environmental benefits from the actions targeted at reducing fertilizer usage and enhancing efficiency since 2015. It also provides valuable insights for estimating and mitigating global N2O emissions from croplands.

AB The introduction of cover crops into monoculture systems to improve soil health has been widely adopted worldwide. However, little is known about the environmental risks and application prospects of different cover crops in spring maize (Zea mays L.) monocultures proposed in the North China Plain. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different winter cover crops on subsequent maize yield, soil fertility, and environmental risks of nitrogen (N) loss, and a questionnaire survey was conducted to examine factors influencing farmers' willingness to adopt cover crops in the North China Plain. Based on the same fertilization regime during the maize growing period, four winter cover crop treatments were set up, including bare fallow, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), February orchid (Orychophragmus violaceus), and winter oilseed rape (Brassica campestris L.). The results indicated that winter cover crops significantly increased subsequent maize yield and soil organic carbon, total N, and microbial biomass carbon and N compared with the bare fallow treatment. The incorporation of cover crops led to a negligible increase in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and had a very limited effect on ammonia (NH3) emissions. The incorporation of February orchid and winter oilseed rape decreased nitrate leaching compared with the hairy vetch treatment in the maize growing season. The N losses via N2O and NH3 emissions and N leaching accounted for 71%-84% of the N surplus. However, yield increase and environmental benefits were not the main positive factors for farmers to accept cover crops. Financial incentive was rated by 83.9% of farmers as an "extremely important" factor, followed by other costs, when considering winter cover cropping. These results indicate that the environmental benefits depend on the type of cover crop. Maintaining high levels of soil fertility and maize yield, providing sufficient subsidies, and encouraging large-area cultivation of cover crops are critical measures to promote winter cover cropping in the North China Plain.

AB Application of the inhibitor-amended nitrogen fertilizers is a recommended method for reducing agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. However, the potential impacts of these inhibitors on soil environments still needs to be evaluated using long-term experiments. Through a 6-year field observation, the effects of combined application of a nitrification inhibitor (dicyandiamide, DCD) and a urease inhibitor (hydroquinone, HQ) on N2O emission, as well as soil ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in a maize (Zea mays L.) field in Northeast China were investigated. The results showed that annual soil N2O emissions were 0.466, 1.021 and 0.874 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for N0 fertilizer treatment (CK), Urea treatment (U) and Urea + DCD + HQ treatment (UDH), respectively. A significant linear correlation was found between the N2O accumulation in the first month after fertilizer application and the short-term precipitation (i.e., a period from 10 days before to 20 days after fertilizer application). The N2O emissions in the freeze-thaw period accounted for up to 42.5% of the year-round N2O emissions. The remarkable fluctuations of annual N2O emissions were observed (their coefficients of variation were 68.3%, 77.7% and 71.2% for CK, U and UDH treatments, respectively); these fluctuations were mainly attributed to the precipitation. The averaged N2O emission factors (EF) (0.308% and 0.227% for U and UDH treatments, respectively) were far less than the default mean EF of 1% proposed by (IPCC, 2006). An averaged N2O mitigation of 26.4% was fulfilled by UDH application. The results of quantitative PCR for soil nitrification and denitrification gene copy numbers measurement showed that UDH treatment significantly decreased the ammonia oxidation bacteria (AOB) amoA gene copy numbers by 74% on the 10th day after UDH application. No significant effects of combined application of DCD and HQ on microbial denitrification functional gene abundance were observed.

AB The experiment was conducted to explore the impact of different environmental factors on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission flux after application of fertilizer. An experiment was conducted in 2016 to determine the N2O emissions in maize yellow soil. There were four treatments: no fertilizer (CK); common fertilizer (CF); chemical fertilizer + organic fertilizer (OF); fertilizer + bio-organic fertilizer (BF). Therefore, the experiment was designed to study N2O emission characteristics and environmental factors after application of organic fertilizer. The results indicated that N2O emissions reached three peaks in corn-growing season. An average N2O emission flux of the four treatment process could be ranked as OF>BF>CF>CK, which was measured as 0.080, 0.069, 0.010 and 0.007 mg.m(-2) .h(-1) respectively; the total N2O emissions of soil after application of OF and BF were improved for 15 times and 11 times, respectively as compared with CK. According to relevant analysis, N2O emission flux of yellow cornfield was mainly related either to the carbon-nitrogen ratio (P<0.05) in the farmland or to the soil nitrate nitrogen (N) content (P<0.05) after application of organic fertilizer. Moreover, N2O emissions of yellow cornfield were increased after application of OF and BF, and relatively reduced after CF. As a result, the increased N2O emissions were mainly caused by carbon nitrogen ratio and soil nitrate content of cornfield. Therefore, an important way to reduce N2O emissions in cornfield is to control the application of organic fertilizer and carbon nitrogen ratio. (C) 2018 Friends Science Publishers

AB A large number of natural wetlands in northeast China have been reclaimed as farmland in the last few decades, and soybean is the main rain-fed crop here. For the depth understanding of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from reclaimed soybean fields, using static opaque chamber method, we conducted a four-year N2O flux measurement at two adjacent soybean fields cultivated after wetland drainage in 1987 and 1993, respectively, in the Sanjiang Plain of northeast China Using static opaque chamber method,. Both sites had two treatments including soybean cropped and bare soils (i.e., SF87, BS87, SF93 and BS93). The results showed that soil N2O emission from all of the plots was severely inhibited by the low temperature in winter (November to March), while a N2O emission pulse occurred during the spring thaw (April and May). Temporal variation of the N2O fluxes during the growing season varied over all the four years but was mainly affected by soil water-filled pore space (WFPS). Intense rainfall events increased the intensity and duration of N2O pulses during the growing season, and most high fluxes were occurred at WFPS > 45%. The mean annual N2O emission from all treatments over four years was 4.8 +/- 1.2 kg N ha(-1) (ranges: 1.9-19.8), and one third of the emission originated from the spring-thaw. In addition, soybean growth did not increase N2O emissions during the growing season, which support the cancellation of N2O emission calculations from nitrogen fixed by legumes in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

AB Straw incorporation (SI) combined with N fertilizer has been shown to affect soil N2O emission and N-related functional microbes in agriculture. However, the responses of N2O emission, community structure of nitrifiers and denitrifiers and related microbial functional genes to straw management strategies in the winter wheat season in China remain unclear. Here, we conducted a two-season experiment in a winter wheat field in Ningjing County, northern China, to examine four treatments: no fertilizer with (N0S1) and without maize straw (N0S0); N fertilizer with (N1S1) and without maize straw (N1S0), and their effects on N2O emissions, soil chemical parameters, crop yield, as well as the dynamics of nitrifying and denitrifying microbial communities. We found that seasonal N2O emissions decreased by 7.1-11.1% (p < 0.05) in N1S1 as compared to N1S0, without significant difference between N0S1 and N0S0. In combination with N fertilization, SI increased the yield by 2.6-4.3%, altered the microbial community composition, increased Shannon and ACE indexes, and decreased the abundance of AOA (9.2%), AOB (32.2%; p < 0.05), nirS (35.2%; p < 0.05), nirK (21.6%; p < 0.05) and nosZ (19.2%). However, in the absence of N fertilizer, SI promoted the major genera of Nitrosavbrio (AOB), unclassifiied_Gammaproteobacteria, Rhodanobacter (nirS), Sinorhizobium (nirK), which strongly correlated positively with N2O emissions. Thereby, a negative interaction effect between SI and N fertilizer on AOB and nirS emphasized that SI could offset the increase of N2O emission caused by fertilization. Soil moisture and NO3- concentration were the major factors affecting N-related microbial community structure. Our study reveals that SI suppressed N2O emission significantly and simultaneously decreased the abundance of N-related functional genes and altered denitrifying bacterial community composition. We conclude that SI helps to enhance yield and alleviate fertilizer-induced environmental costs in intensively farmed fields in northern China.

AB Returning crop residues to agricultural fields can accelerate nutrient turnover and increase N2O and NO emissions. Increased microbial respiration may lead to formation of local hotspots with anoxic or microoxic conditions promoting denitrification. To investigate the effect of litter quality on CO2, NO, N2O, and N-2 emissions, we conducted a laboratory incubation study in a controlled atmosphere (He/O-2, or pure He) with different maize litter types (Zea mays L., young leaves and roots, straw). We applied the N2O isotopocule mapping approach to distinguish between N2O emitting processes and partitioned the CO2 efflux into litter- and soil organic matter (SOM)-derived CO2 based on the natural C-13 isotope abundances. Maize litter increased total and SOM derived CO2 emissions leading to a positive priming effect. Although C turnover was high, NO and N2O fluxes were low under oxic conditions as high O-2 diffusivity limited denitrification. In the first week, nitrification contributed to NO emissions, which increased with increasing net N mineralization. Isotopocule mapping indicated that bacterial processes dominated N2O formation in litter-amended soil in the beginning of the incubation experiment with a subsequent shift towards fungal denitrification. With onset of anoxic incubation conditions after 47 days, N fluxes strongly increased, and heterotrophic bacterial denitrification became the main source of N2O. The N2O/(N2O+N-2) ratio decreased with increasing litter C:N ratio and C-org:NO3- ratio in soil, confirming that the ratio of available C:N is a major control of denitrification product stoichiometry.

AB Nitrification inhibitors are widely used in agriculture to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and increase crop yield. However, no concrete information on their mitigation of N2O emission is available under soil and environmental conditions as in Pakistan. A field experiment was established using a silt clay loam soil from Peshawar, Pakistan, to study the effect of urea applied in combination with a nitrification inhibitor, nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-tri-chloromethyl pyridine), and/or a plant growth regulator, gibberellic acid (GA(3)), on N2O emission and the nitrogen (N) uptake efficiency of maize. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with five treatments in four replicates: control with no N (CK), urea (200 kg N ha(-1)) alone, urea in combination with nitrapyrin (700 g ha(-1)), urea in combination with GA(3) (60 g ha(-1)), and urea in combination with nitrapyrin and GA(3). The N2O emission, yield, N response efficiency, and total N uptake were measured during the experimental period. The treatment with urea and nitrapyrin reduced total N2O emission by 39%-43% and decreased yield-scaled N2O emission by 47%-52%, relative to the treatment with urea alone. The maize plant biomass, grain yield, and total N uptake increased significantly by 23%, 17%, and 15%, respectively, in the treatment with urea and nitrapyrin, relative to the treatment with urea alone, which was possibly due to N saving, lower N loss, and increased N uptake in the form of ammonium; they were further enhanced in the treatment with urea, nitrapyrin, and GA(3) by 27%, 36%, and 25%, respectively, probably because of the stimulating effect of GA(3) on plant growth and development and the reduction in biotic and abiotic stresses. These results suggest that applying urea in combination with nitrapyrin and GA(3) has the potential to mitigate N2O emission, improve N response efficiency, and increase maize yield.

AB A long-term field experiment was established to determine the influence of mineral fertilizer (NPK) or organic manure (composed of wheat straw, oil cake and cottonseed cake) on soil fertility. A tract of calcareous fluvo-aquic soil (aquic inceptisol) in the Fengqiu State Key Experimental Station for Ecological Agriculture (Fengqiu county, Henan province, China) was fertilized beginning in September 1989 and N2O emissions were examined during the maize and wheat growth seasons of 2002-2003. The study involved seven treatments: organic manure (OM), half-orgamic manure plus half-fertilizer N (1/2 OMN), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NP (NP), fertilizer NK (NK), fertilizer PK (PK) and control (CK). Manured soils had higher organic C and N contents, but lower pH and bulk densities than soils receiving the various mineralized fertilizers especially those lacking P, indicating that long-term application of manures could efficiently prevent the leaching of applied N from and increase N content in the plowed layer. The application of manures and fertilizers at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) year I significantly increased N2O emissions from 150 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the CK treatment soil to 856 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the OM treatment soil; however, there was no significant difference between the effect of fertilizer and manure on N2O emission. More N2O was released during the 102-day maize growth season than during the 236-day wheat growth season in the N-fertilized soils but not in N-unfertilized soils. N2O emission was significantly affected by soil moisture during the maize growth season and by soil temperature during the wheat growth season. In sum, this study showed that manure added to a soil tested did not result in greater N2O emission than treatment with a N-containing fertilizer, but did confer greater benefits for soil fertility and the environment.

AB Covering soils using mulch can increase crop productivity in dryland agriculture. However, there remains large uncertainty regarding impacts of mulching on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, especially under climate change (increases in air temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration and changes in precipitation). In this study, we applied a biogeochemical model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), to predict impacts of different mulching practices on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) yields and N2O emissions under future climate scenarios in the South Loess Plateau of China. When tested against the observed crop yields and N(2)O( )emissions under no-mulching (NM), straw mulching (SM), and plastic film mulching (PM), DNDC successfully simulated crop yields and annual N2O emissions under all treatments. Simulations and observations both suggested that applying SM or PM increased crop yields and N2O emissions in comparison with NM. Sensitivity analyses of crop yields and N2O emissions indicated that the crop yields were primarily influenced by precipitation and N2O emissions were sensitive to changes in air temperature, precipitation, soil organic carbon, and nitrogen application rate. Application of SM or PM reduced the sensitivity of the crop yield and N2O emissions to precipitation change. Compared with historical climate conditions, future climate from 2017 to 2100 significantly increased crop yields except during the 2090s for NM or SM and during the 2070s to 2090s for PM under the high emission scenario (RCP8.5), while N2O emissions were increased under all treatments. The positive impacts of PM on crop yields could be reduced under the RCP8.5 scenario. The DNDC predictions suggest that straw mulching might be an optimum mulching method to improve crop productivity and mitigate increasing N2O under future climate conditions in semi-arid to sub-humid areas such as the South Loess Plateau of China.

AB Chemical composition of root and shoot litter controls decomposition and, subsequently, C availability for biological nitrogen transformation processes in soils. While aboveground plant residues have been proven to increase N2O emissions, studies on root litter effects are scarce. This study aimed (1) to evaluate how fresh maize root litter affects N2O emissions compared to fresh maize shoot litter, (2) to assess whether N2O emissions are related to the interaction of C and N mineralization from soil and litter, and (3) to analyze changes in soil microbial community structures related to litter input and N2O emissions.
   To obtain root and shoot litter, maize plants (Zea mays L.) were cultivated with two N fertilizer levels in a greenhouse and harvested. A two-factorial 22 d laboratory incubation experiment was set up with soil from both N levels (N1, N2) and three litter addition treatments (control, root, root C shoot). We measured CO2 and N2O fluxes, analyzed soil mineral N and water-extractable organic C (WEOC) concentrations, and determined quality parameters of maize litter. Bacterial community structures were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
   Maize litter quality controlled NO3- and WEOC availability and decomposition-related CO2 emissions. Emissions induced by maize root litter remained low, while high bioavailability of maize shoot litter strongly increased CO2 and N2O emissions when both root and shoot litter were added. We identified a strong positive correlation between cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions, supporting our hypothesis that litter quality affects denitrification by creating plant-litter-associated anaerobic microsites. The interdependency of C and N availability was validated by analyses of regression. Moreover, there was a strong positive interaction between soil NO3- and WEOC concentration resulting in much higher N2O emissions, when both NO3- and WEOC were available. A significant correlation was observed between total CO2 and N2O emissions, the soil bacterial community composition, and the litter level, showing a clear separation of root + shoot samples of all remaining samples. Bacterial diversity decreased with higher N level and higher input of easily available C. Altogether, changes in bacterial community structure reflected degradability of maize litter with easily degradable C from maize shoot litter favoring fast-growing C-cycling and N-reducing bacteria of the phyla Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. In conclusion, litter quality is a major driver of N2O and CO2 emissions from crop residues, especially when soil mineral N is limited.

AB Applying nitrogen (N) using split application to improve temporal synchronicity between crop-N demand and soil-N availability is a key strategy for improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Its effect on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions has not been well evaluated, especially from plastic mulching maize (Zea mays L.) in semiarid farmland. We conducted a two-year experiment to investigate the effect of split fertilizer N application on N2O emissions. Three approaches each applying a total of 225 kg N ha(-1) were tested either as a single application at sowing (N1), N applied with two splits at a ratio of 4:6 (N2), and N applied with three splits at a ratio of 4:3:3 (N3), a no-N application treatment was also included as a control (NO). Compared with the single application, split application of N significantly increased the grain yields by 4.7-9.1%. The cumulative N2O emissions significantly increased by 18.1% under the three splits application in the 2014-2015 season compared with the single application but not in the growing season of 2015, which followed the same pattern with yield-scaled N2O emissions. Fertilizer application combined with precipitation was the main driving factor for N2O emissions. Therefore, the higher frequency (three times) of fertilizer application had a high risk for increasing N2O emissions due to the relatively strong and frequent precipitation in maize mid and late growth period in this region; applying N with two splits is more suitable for this region which could produce higher grain yields, and lower risk of N2O emissions.

AB Excessive inorganic fertilizers are one of the main causes of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Organic fertilizers can not only reduce the use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers by increasing soil organic matter but are also safe for the environment. The partial replacement of nitrogen (N) fertilizers with organic fertilizers can potentially reduce N2O emissions. To illuminate the best ratio for the nitrogen replacement of inorganic fertilizer, the present experiment was conducted in dryland areas of central Gansu Province and different portions of inorganic N fertilizers (200 kg ha(-1)); i.e., 0, 50, 37.5, 25, and 12.5% were replaced with commercial organic fertilizers to test their effects on soil physicochemical properties, the grain yield of maize, N2O emissions, and the diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacterial (AOB) communities. Results showed that the maximum N2O emission was obtained by 100% inorganic fertilizers and the lowest was obtained at the control (no fertilizer). Substituting inorganic fertilizers with organic manure not only reduced N2O emissions but also improved soil organic carbon content and soil moisture and typically improves grain yield and biomass. The highest reduction in N2O emissions was recorded by 50% substitution. Furthermore, 37.5% and 12.5% substitutions did not reduce the grain yield and biomass compared to 100% inorganic fertilizer, and a 37.5% substitution performed better in improving soil fertility. Organic fertilizer increased the amoA copy number of AOA but decreased that of AOB. Nitrososphaera (AOA) and Nitrosospira (AOB) were the most dominant ammonia-oxidizing communities. Structural equation modeling indicated that AOB contributes more N2O emissions than AOA and is more sensitive to changes in pH, moisture, and NO3--N, and the input of organic fertilizers may affect AOB by influencing soil physicochemical traits. In summary, replacing a reasonable proportion (37.5%) of inorganic fertilizers with organic manure improves soil fertility, reduces N2O emissions, and stabilizes production.

AB In-field measurements of direct soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions provide critical data for quantifying the net energy efficiency and economic feasibility of crop residue-based bioenergy production systems. A major challenge to such assessments has been the paucity of field studies addressing the effects of crop residue removal and associated best practices for soil management (i.e., conservation tillage) on soil emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). This regional survey summarizes soil GHG emissions from nine maize production systems evaluating different levels of corn stover removal under conventional or conservation tillage management across the US Corn Belt. Cumulative growing season soil emissions of CO2, N2O, and/or CH4 were measured for 2-5 years (2008-2012) at these various sites using a standardized static vented chamber technique as part of the USDA-ARS's Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices (REAP) regional partnership. Cumulative soil GHG emissions during the growing season varied widely across sites, by management, and by year. Overall, corn stover removal decreased soil total CO2 and N2O emissions by -4 and -7 %, respectively, relative to no removal. No management treatments affected soil CH4 fluxes. When aggregated to total GHG emissions (Mg CO2 eq ha(-1)) across all sites and years, corn stover removal decreased growing season soil emissions by -5 +/- 1 % (mean +/- se) and ranged from -36 % to 54 % (n = 50). Lower GHG emissions in stover removal treatments were attributed to decreased C and N inputs into soils, as well as possible microclimatic differences associated with changes in soil cover. High levels of spatial and temporal variabilities in direct GHG emissions highlighted the importance of site-specific management and environmental conditions on the dynamics of GHG emissions from agricultural soils.

AB Levels of N-cycle gene transcripts (nirK, nirS, nosZ, amoA) were measured during an N2O emission peak in an agricultural soil. Automated dynamic closed chambers were used to monitor an N2O emission peak on a maize crop after a natural rainfall. The peak occurred rapidly after the rainfall began. Spatial and temporal variability in N2O emission was observed between chambers. An analysis of N-cycle gene transcript levels revealed an increase in bacterial amoA gene transcripts (but not in archaeal amoA transcripts), correlating strongly with N2O emission. This suggests the involvement of nitrification enzymes, despite a high water-filled pore space (80%). Reverse transcription of bacterial 16S rRNA followed by partial sequencing of the resulting cDNAs revealed few rainfall-induced changes in the potentially active bacterial community, and notably no significant change in the relative abundance of 16S rRNAs from the nitrifier genus Nitrosospira. Expression of the amoA gene appears as a possible proxy for monitoring the N2O emission peak. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment to evaluate the expression of N-cycle genes during an N2O emission peak on an agricultural field. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer to increase crop yields has a significant influence on soil methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission/uptake. A meta-analysis was carried out on the effect of N application on (i) CH4 emissions in rice paddies, (ii) CH4 uptake in upland fields and (iii) N2O emissions. The responses of CH4 emissions to N application in rice paddies were highly variable and overall no effects were found. CH4 emissions were stimulated at low N application rates (<100 kg N ha(-1)) but inhibited at high N rates (>200 kg N ha(-1)) as compared to no N fertilizer (control). The response of CH4 uptake to N application in upland fields was 15% lower than control, with a mean CH4 uptake factor of 0.001 kg CH4-C kg(-1) N. The mean N2O emission factors were 1.00 and 0.94% for maize (Zea mays) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), respectively, but significantly lower for the rice (Oryza sativa) (0.51%). Compared with controls, N addition overall increased global warming potential of CH4 and N2O emissions by 78%. Our result revealed that response of CH4 emission to N input might depend on the CH4 concentration in rice paddy. The critical factors that affected CH4 uptake and N2O emission were N fertilizer application rate and the controls of CH4 uptake and N2O emission. The influences of application times, cropping systems and measurement frequency should all be considered when assessing CH4 and N2O emissions/uptake induced by N fertilizer.

AB Straw return to agricultural soils is considered as a key strategy to improve soil organic C (SOC) sequestration and crop production. However, changes in SOC can affect soil N-turnover and associated N2O and NO fluxes, as soil biogeochemical C- and N-cycles are strongly coupled. Understanding how and to what extent N-trace gas emissions per unit crop yield respond to changes in SOC following straw return, is critical for balancing food security and climate change mitigation. Here we report on an experiment in a Chinese wheat-maize system designed to understand the effects of long-term (2005-2020) different straw management options (straw return, burning or removal) on SOC stocks and yields, completed by N2O and NO flux measurements over the period 2016-2020. Our results showed that the increase in SOC stocks following straw return tended to level off over time, indicating that SOC saturation is reached after 12-13 years under straw return. Soil N-trace gas emissions showed high inter- and intra-annual variability, which were largely driven by changes in rainfall, soil hydrothermal conditions or soil C- and N-availability. Compared to straw burning or removal, long-term straw return increased annual N2O emissions by 9 %-49 %, to 2.72-2.98 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), while NO emissions were decreased by 12 %-28 %, to 0.83-0.90 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The annual N2O emissions roughly offset the total C sink (SOC sequestration and CH4 uptake) by 40 %-46 %, but will override the climate benefits of total C sink as the SOC pool becomes saturated. However, because yields were higher in straw return treatments, yield-scaled annual N2O emissions remained unchanged. Our unique dataset allows for the first time a better understanding of the dynamics between SOC sequestration, yields and N-trace gas emissions, with results calling for action to address the risk of increasing N2O emissions following long-term SOC increases induced by straw return.

AB Crop residues as key organic carbon inputs have the potential for soil carbon sequestration. However, previous studies have shown an inconsistent effect of residue return on the direction and magnitude of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. We used a laboratory-based soil incubation study to test the response of N2O emission to crop residue type, soil moisture, and how nutrient management modulates these responses. In this study, we incorporated crop residues with different qualities (wheat, rice, soybean, and maize) at two soil moisture contents {80% field capacity (FC) and 60% FC} and under seven nutrient levels: N0P0K0 (no nutrients), N0PK, N100PK, N150PK, N100PK + manure@ 5 Mg ha(-1), N100PK + biochar@ 5 Mg ha(-1), and N150PK + biochar@ 5 Mg ha(-1). The results demonstrated significant (p < 0.01) differences in the magnitude of N2O emissions among treatments. However, only the interaction effect of residue x nutrient and nutrient x moisture was significant (p < 0.05). N100PK and N150PK at 80% FC mitigated N2O emission by approximately 20% in wheat residue-amended soil (cf. control soil without residue). In contrast, maize residue amendment (cf. control soil) increased N2O emission by 130% under N0P0K0 and 80% FC. Residue effects were negatively correlated with the C:N ratio, and a strong positive correlation (p < 0.01) was obtained between N2O emission and CO2 respiration, labile carbon, mineral N, and residue total nitrogen (TN). When no nutrients were added, N2O emission was higher in residue returned soil. However, cumulative fluxes of N2O decreased by 6-17% when maize and wheat residues (cf. control soil) were applied with nutrients. Negative fluxes of N2O indicating consumption were observed in every treatment after 57 days of incubation and were most pronounced in control soil without residue and nutrients. Decreasing the soil moisture from 80% FC to 60% FC, the N2O consumption rate increased by 6.6 times across residue types and nutrient management. The regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) results showed that residue TN, soil CO2 emission, NO3-N, and labile SOC were the key predictor variables and could explain 82% variability in the soil N2O emission in the Vertisols of Central India. The results suggested that nutrient addition (NPK) could alter the magnitude and direction of soil N2O flux by residue type and soil moisture by influencing the underlying soil microbial processes of the C and N cycle in the Vertisol of subtropical India.

AB Feeding a growing population, which will reach 10 billion in 2050, is a major challenge. Another major challenge is to increase crops' productivity in a sustainable way, as the increase in agricultural inputs may lead to greenhouse gas emissions, including N2O fertiliser. Several factors can influence N2O emissions such as irrigation, the soil management system, or the type of fertiliser used. The aim of this research is to study the impact of each above-mentioned factor on N2O emissions during three growing seasons in a maize field, considering three nitrogen fertilisers: urea (U), ammonium nitrate (AN), and a fertiliser with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP); two irrigation strategies: on demand (100%) and deficit irrigation (75% of demand); and a comparison of two soil management systems: conventional tillage (T) systems and no-tillage (NT) system. The interactions among the three factors and their effects on emissions were analysed through a principal component analysis. Higher emissions were recorded in plots that received the highest irrigation dose. The most favourable management to reduce N2O emissions derived from agricultural activity for maize crops under a Mediterranean climate was the NT soil management, using a fertiliser with nitrification inhibitor and an irrigation dose of 75% of conventional irrigation.

AB There is growing evidence for a positive non-linear response in N2O emissions where increasing N fertilizer rates critically exceed crop requirements from a range of cropping systems. However, the majority of these studies have been conducted in temperate regions, and it remains unclear if the non-linear response hypothesis can be transferred to tropical regions due to their inherently lower carbon (C) content and fertility. This study assessed the impact of different nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rates in combination with a carbon source (green-waste compost) on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and crop productivity from a maize-soybean rotation in tropical Sri Lanka. Low cation exchange capacity and extremely high rainfall promoted higher annual cumulative N2O emissions than reported from other cropping systems, ranging from 2.4-9.16 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the different fertilizer rates (0 N, 100 N, 220 N, 300 N). The Delta N2O emitted for every additional kilogram of fertilizer N applied (i.e. the marginal N2O emission), declined from similar to 24 g kg(-1) for the first 0-100 kg N applied to 7 g kg(-1) at 300 kg N. This resulted in declining Emission Factors with increasing N rate, as factors other than N limited denitrification. The addition of compost removed this limitation, resulting in constant Delta N2O production rates and Emission Factors with increasing N inputs, suggesting low C availability limited N2O production at high N rates. The study shows that the non-linear response hypothesis might not hold for highly weathered tropical soils, where C availability limits N2O emissions at high N inputs. While the use of compost can be a viable option to increase soil fertility in these highly weathered tropical soils, it needs to be balanced with reduced N fertilizer application rates to avoid elevated losses of N2O.

AB Given the common problem of fertilizer overuse, agronomists are calling for a reduction of the high nitrogen dose by 1/3. We carried out a field experiment over two full winter wheat-summer maize rotations in the North China Plain (NCP) to determine whether this degree of nitrogen reduction will significantly reduce the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Three treatments were investigated in the field trial: a control with no nitrogen application, the conventional practice with nitrogen over-application and the optimal practice with a reduced dose of nitrogen by 1/3. Our observations across all treatments over the experimental period reveal significant correlations of the fluxes of either gas with soil temperature and moisture as well as the concentrations of soil ammonium, nitrate and dissolvable organic carbon. There were strong correlations within the functions of the dual Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving apparent activation energy values of 40-97 and 59-92 kJ mol(-1) for N2O and NO fluxes, respectively. Our results provide annual direct emission factors of 0.48-0.96% for N2O and 0.15-0.47% for NO and demonstrate a significant correlation between N2O emission induced by fertilization and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The correlation indicates a significant potential of N2O mitigation via enhancing NUEs. A reduction in the nitrogen dose did not obviously mitigate either the annual NO emission in both rotations or the annual N2O emission in the second one. However, nitrogen reduction significantly decreased the annual total N2O emission by 38% during the first rotation. These inconsistencies in the responses of N2O emission to the reduced nitrogen dose can be attributed to improper fertilization practices, such as broadcasting urea prior to heavy rainfalls or irrigation events during the maize season, which implies a need for further fertilization practice options/techniques in addition to the reduction of nitrogen doses.

AB Addressing concerns about mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while maintaining high grain yield requires improved management practices that achieve sustainable intensification of cereal production systems. In the North China Plain, a field experiment was conducted to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes during the maize (Zea mays L.) season under various agricultural management regimes including conventional treatment (CONT) with high N fertilizer application at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) and overuse of groundwater by flood irrigation, optimal fertilization 1 treatment (OPT1T), optimal fertilization 2 treatment (OPT2T), and controlled-release urea treatment (CRUT) with reduced N fertilizer application and irrigation, and a control (CK) with no N fertilizer. In contrast to CONT, balanced N fertilization treatments (OPT1T, OPT2T, and CRUT) and CK demonstrated a significant drop in cumulative N2O emission (1.70 v.s. 0.43-1.07 kg N ha(-1)), indicating that balanced N fertilization substantially reduced N2O emission. The values of the N2O emission factor were 0.42%, 0.29%, 0.32%, and 0.27% for CONT, OPT1T, OPT2T, and CRUT, respectively. Global warming potentials, which were predominantly determined by N2O emission, were estimated to be 188 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) for CK and 419-765 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) for the N fertilization treatments. Global warming potential intensity calculated by considering maize yield was significantly lower for OPT1T, OPT2T, CRUT, and CK than for CONT. Therefore, OPT1T, OPT2T, and CRUT were recommended as promising management practices for sustaining maize yield and reducing GHG emissions in the North China Plain.

AB Application of nitrogen (N) can increase the supply of N in soil and, in turn, can lead to higher yield-but also to large increase in emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) if applied in excess. To determine the optimum dose of N for maize planting system, we analysed the relationship between yield and emissions of GHGs at seven levels of N, namely 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 kg ha(-1), using the DNDC (denitrification decomposition) model and maize grown with and without mulching. The model simulated the following variables: maize production; emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4); global warming potential (GWP); and GHG intensity (GHGI). We used data from 1980 to 2013 for a rain-fed region of the Loess Plateau in north-western China and validated the DNDC model against data from field experiments. The model performed well in simulating yield and GHG emissions (Adj.R-2 > 0.61). Under mulching, the average yield of maize was 3.6-12.2 t ha(-1) and the partial factor productivity was 73.1-35.0 kg kg(-1); and both of these were significantly higher 78%-236% than those in the crop without mulching. The emissions of CO2, N2O, and the GWP increased with the increase in the dose of N whereas CH4 emissions remained unaffected by the dose. Mulching increased yields significantly in the north-western region, and the GWP and GHGI were higher mainly in the central and north-western regions. The optimum dose of N for maize grown with mulching ranged between 150 kg ha(-1) and 200 kg ha(-1) and offers the best balance between higher yield and lower emissions. The optimum dose may promote the development of mulched maize and provide a reference standard for dryland agriculture in zones with similar climates elsewhere in the world.

AB BACKGROUNDScientific fertilization plays a crucial role in addressing food security and mitigating environmental costs. We conducted a two-season field experiment in northwest China and synthesized 151 national studies to quantitatively assess the potentials of N rate, source (controlled-release urea, nitrification inhibitors, urease inhibitors, and manure) and deep placement to simultaneously reduce ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions while maintaining yields.RESULTSField results showed that reducing N rate from 300 to 200 kg N ha-1 resulted in a marginal yield penalty (5.3%) but decreased N2O by 28.2% and NH3 by 17.3%. Literature synthesis identified 180 kg ha-1 as the optimal N rate for 95% yield potential. Deep placement, compared to surface broadcasting, enhanced yield by 2.6% and reduced N2O by 15.3% in field trials, with meta-analysis showing substantial suppression of NH3 (80.5%) and N2O (12.5%). Manure substitution exhibited limited benefits for yield enhancement and N2O mitigation but demonstrated specific efficacy in medium- and coarse-textured soils with low soil organic carbon. Urea plus controlled-release urea performed best from meta-analysis yet its benefit diminished under high rainfall. Urea-nitrification inhibitor blends led to 5.9% higher NH3 and urea-urease inhibitors exerted limited mitigation efficacy on N2O production from field data, with meta-results confirming the risk of urease inhibitors in stimulating NH3. Dual inhibitors worked synergistically to sustain yields and alleviate N losses, especially in alkaline and coarse soils.CONCLUSIONThe combination of using controlled-release fertilizer plus traditional urea mixed with dual inhibitors and deep placement would be an enhanced approach across Chinese maize croplands under all conditions.

AB Incorporating crop residues into the soil is an effective method for improving soil carbon sequestration, fertility, and crop productivity. Such potential benefits, however, may be offset if residue addition leads to a substantial increase in soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study aimed to quantify the effect of different crop residues with varying C/N ratios and different nitrogen (N) fertilizers on GHG emissions, yield, and yield-scaled emissions (GHGI) in winter wheat. The field experiment was conducted during the 2018-2019 winter wheat season, comprising of four residue treatments (no residue, maize residue, soybean residue, and maize-soybean mixed residue) and four fertilizer treatments (control, urea, manure, and manure + urea). The experiment followed a randomized split-plot design, with N treatments as the main plot factor and crop residue treatments as the sub-plot factor. Except for the control, all N treatments received 150 kg N ha(-1) season(-1). The results showed that soils from all treatments acted as a net source of N2O and CO2 fluxes but as a net sink of CH4 fluxes. Soybean residue significantly increased soil N2O emissions, while mixed residue had the lowest N2O emissions among the three residues. However, all residue amendments significantly increased soil CO2 emissions. Furthermore, soybean and mixed residues significantly increased grain yield by 24% and 21%, respectively, compared to no residue amendment. Both soybean and mixed residues reduced GHGI by 25% compared to maize residue. Additionally, the urea and manure + urea treatments exhibited higher N2O emissions among the N treatments, but they contributed to significantly higher grain yields and resulted in lower GHGI. Moreover, crop residue incorporation significantly altered soil N dynamics. In soybean residue-amended soil, both NH4+ and NO3- concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.05). Conversely, soil NO3- content was notably lower in the maize-soybean mixed residue amendment. Overall, our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how different residue additions from different cropping systems influence soil N dynamics and GHG emissions, offering valuable insights into effective agroecosystems management for long-term food security and soil sustainability while mitigating GHG emissions.

AB Agricultural soils are major sources of the greenhouse gas N2O, particularly under maize with high nitrogen (N) inputs and excessive irrigation. To determine how N and water management can mitigate N2O emissions from drip-irrigated maize fields, a field study was carried out in the North China Plain during the maize growing season. The objective of the study was to investigate the individual and combined effects of irrigation level and N input on N2O emissions and grain yields, as well as N and water use efficiency (WUE), under drip-fertigation management. The main treatments were two irrigation levels: 50 mm/event (sufficient irrigation, W-H) and 25 mm/event (limited irrigation, W-L), with four N application rates: 0 (N-0), 90 (N-1), 180 (N-2), and 270 (N-3) kg N ha(-1). Pulses of N2O emissions were recorded every 2-3 d following each irrigation or fertigation (irrigation + fertilization) event. N input, irrigation, and their interactions all significantly influenced N2O emissions. A significant exponential relationship (P < 0.05) was observed between N application rate and cumulative and yield-scaled N2O emissions in both irrigation treatments. The cumulative N2O emission fluxes from the N-0, N-1, N-2, and N-3 levels of fertilizer with W-L were 11.4, 13.8, 27.2, and 58.8% lower, respectively, than those from the same N levels with W-H; this occurred because high pulses of N2O were avoided during low irrigation conditions. Under W-H, denitrification was the likely source of the high amounts of N2O, whereas nitrification was likely the main source of N2O emissions under W-L. The variations in the water-filled pore space (WFPS) between the two irrigation treatments may explain these results. The effect of N fertilizer on grain yield and WUE depended on the availability of soil water. Based on the available soil water content, the regulation of N fertilizer application can increase yield and also reduce cumulative and yield-scaled N2O emissions. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB Afforestation, through the conversion of upland cropland to forest, is of great significance to land use change in montane (hilly) agricultural landscapes worldwide. Such afforestation is Implemented to improve soil and water conservation and facilitate terrestrial carbon sequestration. However, particularly for subtropical and tropical regions, the effects of afforestation on soil N2O emissions have not been well investigated. Therefore, a three-year field experiment was conducted to simultaneously monitor N2O emissions from three paired sites of afforestation with cypress (Cypressus funebris) and adjacent cropland under a wheat-maize rotation system. The experiment was carried out in a subtropical montane agricultural landscape in southwest China. In both forest and cropland ecosystems, the N2O emissions exhibited a pronounced spatial and temporal variability. These variations in N2O emissions can be well explained by the spatiotemporal dynamics of environmental variables, such as soil temperature, WFPS, soil NH4+ or NO3- availability, because these environmental variables correlated significantly with the N 2 0 emissions across different experimental sites and years. The average annual N2O fluxes were 2.69 kg N ha(-1) for cropland and 0.13 kg N ha(-1) for afforestation. It is noteworthy that the annual N2O fluxes for afforestation found in the present study constitute one of the lowest recorded N2O fluxes for unfertilized forest ecosystems globally. Overall, across all experimental sites and years, afforestation with cypress (Cypressus funebris) stands significantly decreased N2O fluxes by over twenty times relative to the adjacent cropland. This outcome suggests that afforestation could be an effective mitigation strategy for soil N2O emissions in a subtropical montane agricultural landscape.

AB No-till (NT) often increases soil carbon (C) sequestration compared with conventional tillage (CT), yet its net effect on N2O emissions is controversial. Cover crops (CCs) adoption is promoted in NT systems because CCs growth curbs nitrate losses via leaching. However, incorporating CC residues into the soil may have positive or negative effects on N2O emissions depending on CC species and agro-ecosystem management. A better understanding of how tillage practices and CC species affect N2O emissions is therefore needed for the development of productive agroecosystems that contribute to climate change mitigation. The objectives of this three-year (2015-2017) field experiment on a Udertic Haplustalf soil in the Po Valley were to compare N2O emissions and crop yield of soybean under NT and CT, and to examine how contrasting residues from two CCs (rye, Secale cereale L. vs hairy vetch, Vicia villosa Roth) affect N2O emissions in NT soybean and maize. We hypothesized that N2O emissions would be lower with NT than with CT and with rye residues than with vetch ones. Nitrous oxide was continuously sampled using automatic chambers during three periods (emergence, N-fixation and maturity) over the soybean-cropping season in 2015 and during the entire cropping maize season in 2017. The DNDC model was calibrated (2015 data) and validated (2017 data), and then used to estimate the annual cumulative N2O emissions in different treatments. Overall, N2O emissions in NT were 40-55% lower than in CT, for both in situ measurements (Period I) and modelled estimations. These differences could be ascribed to the higher water-filled pore space (WFPS) and soil nitrate availability in CT than in NT. No-till also increased SOC content (28%; 0-5 cm) and earthworm abundance (5 times) compared with CT. Within NT systems, N2O emissions were 20-36% lower with rye CC than with vetch CC (P < 0.05), which was a consequence of the lower availability of soil mineral N under rye than under vetch due to the high C/N ratio of rye residues. Yield of soybean and maize under NT was higher with rye CC than with vetch CC. The combination of NT and rye CC that led to the lowest N2O emissions and highest yields should be recommended in the Po Valley region.

AB The environmental benefits of organic farming compared to conventional agriculture are well documented, but relatively few studies have assessed their differences in emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas (GHG). The objective of the study was to assess the interactive impact of management and landscape positions on soil characteristics and N2O emissions. A field-scale experiment was conducted in two adjacent grain farms in upstate New York that have both undergone the same management for 20 years. In the conventional field (CNV), inorganic fertilizer was the only nitrogen (N) source, but in the organic fields (ORG), a legume cover crop, red clover (Thfoliutn pratense), was frost-seeded into a winter grain (spelt, Triticum spelta), and then incorporated in spring as a N source for the subsequent maize plants (Zea mays). Measurements of soil properties and N2O emissions were conducted at shoulder and toeslope positions on both CNV and ORG fields in 2012. Based on Principal Component Analysis, landscape position, management regime, and rotation phases explained 67% of the variation in the soil properties; these three major sources of variation in soil properties (principal components) were correlated significantly with seasonal average N2O emissions. Comparable N2O emissions were found from the clover-maize (ORG Cl-M) phase in the ORG field and the bare fallow-maize phase in the CNV field. The spelt-clover phase in the ORG field had the lowest N2O emissions due to low N availability. In the CNV field, seasonal average N2O emissions were driven mainly by the elevated gas fluxes after fertilizer application. High soil moisture and inorganic N pools towards the end of the growing season probably resulted in increased denitrification rates. The impact of landscape position on N2O emissions was mainly found in the CNV field, probably because greater moisture and pH drove greater rates of complete denitrification at toeslope positions. In the ORG Cl-M phase, the seasonal average N2O emissions were dominated by the emission peaks that immediately followed incorporation of clover. Greater clover biomass at shoulder slope positions resulted in greater N2O peaks there, but the position effect was not statistically significant. Our study suggests that ecosystem state factors, such as landscape characteristics, interacted with management practices to impact soil properties, crop growth, and microbial communities and, therefore, had interactive effects on N dynamics, including N2O emissions.

AB Nitrous oxide (N-N2O) emissions in the agricultural sector represent ca. 25% of total N-N2O emissions on a global scale. In Argentina, information on agricultural emissions is scarce, and thus, N-N2O emissions are estimated by IPCC equations. Most reports in Argentina have estimated N-N2O emissions at crop scale, while few studies estimated emissions at the cropping system scale. Soybean in Argentina is mainly planted as monoculture, though, the inclusion of cereals in crop rotations may modify soil properties associated with N-N2O emissions such as water-filled pore space (%WFPS), soil temperature, or nitrate content. The objectives of this work were to: i) compare N-N2O emissions in crop sequences that include soybean in different proportions; ii) evaluate the impact of these emissions in relation with N inputs (fertilizer + BNF) at the cropping sequence level, and iii) compare these observations with emissions as estimated by the IPCC equation (tier 1). During two years, N-N2O emissions, soil N-NO3-, soil WFPS, and soil temperature were measured biweekly in a long-term experiment under no-tillage in four sequences: i) full-season soybean monoculture (S-S); ii) winter cover crop/soybean (CC/S); iii) double-cropped wheat/soybean - maize (W/S-M), and vi) double-cropped wheat/soybean - winter cover crop/maize (W/S-CC/M). Aboveground biomass, yield (expressed in glucose equivalents), and nitrogen (N) uptake were determined for each crop at harvest. For soybean, additionally to these variables, N derived from biological N fixation (BNF) was determined, as well. N-N2O emissions were scaled to yield and to vegetative biomass. During the two years of this study, cumulated biomass (expressed in glucose equivalents) was significantly lower in S-S and CC/S (29.5 and 36.8 Mg GluEq ha(-1), respectively) than in W/S-M and W/S-CC/M (48.6 and 54.6 Mg GluEq ha 1, respectively). In the same period, exported cumulated N with grains was similar among sequences averaging 277 kg N ha(-1), while the largest cumulated N input (N fertilizer + BNF) was 392 kg N ha(-1) in W/SCC/M, surpassing the other sequences by 100%. N-N2O flux rates were the lowest in W/S-M (7.8 mu g N-N2O m(2)h 1) and the highest in CC/S (19.0 mu g N-N2O m(-2)h(-1)). Therefore, at the cropping sequence level, N-N2O emissions represented on average 0.62% of cumulated N inputs. A multiple regression model indicated that NN2O emissions were more related to soil %WFPS (0-20 cm) and soil temperature (at 10 cm). IPCC direct emission equation (tier 1) overestimated N-N2O emissions for W/S-M and W/S-CC-M. In absolute terms, sequences including cereals showed similar cumulated emissions to S-S, however, when emission were scaled to unit yield or vegetative biomass, sequences that included cereals in the rotation attenuated N-N2O losses.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate N2O emissions during the first three months after different nitrogen (N) source treatments involving green manure and chemical fertilizer in a sugarcane field in Okinawa, Japan. Four treatment plots were established: 100 and 300 kg N ha(-1) chemical fertilizer (100N and 300N plots, respectively); green manure (Crotalaria juncea, 150 kg N ha(-1), C:N=20; GM plot); and the control (0N plot). We regularly measured N2O flux and soil inorganic N (NH4+-N and NO3--N), and also recorded environmental data. There were no significant differences in the fluctuation pattern and peaks of N2O emissions between the 100N and GM plots, and total N2O emissions were comparable, though the applied N amount was higher in the GM plot. Little rainfall in the early period should limit microbial activity in the 100N plot, though soil NH4+-N and NO3--N contents were higher in the 100N plot than in the GM plot. Total N2O emissions in the 300N plot were 1.5-times higher than in the 100N and GM plots. Collectively, the results suggest that the amount of applied N more strongly affected N2O emission than the difference in N substrate quality.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can form symbionts with plant roots, acquire soil nitrogen, and affect nitrous oxide (N2O) production. Biochar, as a soil additive for the management of agricultural soil, affects soil nitrogen (N) utilization and plant growth. However, how AMF regulates soil N unitization, the denitrification process, and N2O emissions in plant-soil systems remains largely unknown, particularly under the biochar amendment. In this study, a microcosm experiment was conducted to investigate the impacts of different mycorrhizal treatments (CK: neither AMF hyphae nor plant roots; AMF: only AMF hyphae; AMF + R: AMF hyphae and plant roots) on plant growth, soil N fertilizer utilization, N2O production and consumption, functional gene abundance, and N2O emission at two biochar addition levels (B0: no biochar; B1: biochar addition rate of 10 g<middle dot>kg-1 soil) in a maize planting soil system. The results revealed that AMF alone and AMF with plant root treatments enhanced the fresh weight of maize plants by 10.15% and 19.23% and decreased soil inorganic N contents by 33.28% and 75.56%, respectively. The combination of biochar, AMF, and plant roots showed the largest increase in maize plant biomass. The AMF and AMF with root treatments all significantly decreased the nirS + nirK/nosZ ratio and N2O emissions at two biochar levels. The presence of AMF and plant roots during biochar amendment showed the smallest nirS + nirK/nosZ ratio and N2O emissions. The AMF combined with biochar and AMF and plant roots combined with biochar treatments increased nirS + nirK/nosZ by 24.32% and 26.90% and decreased N2O accumulation emission by 21.12% and 38.13%, respectively. The results imply that biochar, AMF, and plant roots reduced N2O emissions directly by reducing soil N and increasing soil N unitization efficiency and indirectly by shifting the N2O production and consumption gene abundance in agroecosystems. These findings suggest that the addition of biochar and AMF and/or the presence of plant roots can interact to alleviate soil N2O emissions by manipulating plant inorganic N acquisition and the soil denitrification process.

AB Agronomical and environmental benefits are associated with replacing winter fallow by cover crops (CCs). Yet, the effect of this practice on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remains poorly understood. In this context, a field experiment was carried out under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effect of replacing the traditional winter fallow (F) by vetch (Vicia sativa L.; V) or barley (Hordeum vulgare L.; B) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the intercrop and the maize (Zea mays L.) cropping period. The maize was fertilized following integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) criteria. Maize nitrogen (N) uptake, soil mineral N concentrations, soil temperature and moisture, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and GHG fluxes were measured during the experiment. Our management (adjusted N synthetic rates due to ISFM) and pedo-climatic conditions resulted in low cumulative N2O emissions (0.57 to 0.75 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) , yield-scaled N2O emissions (36 gN(2)O-N kg aboveground N uptake(-1)) and N surplus (31 to 56 kg N ha(-1)) for all treatments. Although CCs increased N2O emissions during the intercrop period compared to F (1.6 and 2.6 times in B and V, respectively), the ISFM resulted in similar cumulative emissions for the CCs and F at the end of the maize cropping period. The higher C : N ratio of the B residue led to a greater proportion of N2O losses from the synthetic fertilizer in these plots when compared to V. No significant differences were observed in CH4 and CO2 fluxes at the end of the experiment. This study shows that the use of both legume and nonlegume CCs combined with ISFM could provide, in addition to the advantages reported in previous studies, an opportunity to maximize agronomic efficiency (lowering synthetic N requirements for the subsequent cash crop) without increasing cumulative or yield-scaled N2O losses.

AB Maize and wheat are two major staple foods that collectively contribute two-thirds of the world's grain supply. The extensive use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers during the cultivation of both crops leads to significant losses of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into the environment. Here, using machine learning algorithms, we generate high-resolution maps of crop-specific soil Nr losses based on global field measurements. We estimate that global annual soil Nr losses from the use of synthetic N fertilizer in 2020, including direct emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), ammonia (NH3), N leaching and run-off, amount to 0.18, 1.62, 0.09, 1.47 and 1.10 million tonnes N for maize, and 0.12, 1.33, 0.07, 1.21 and 0.95 million tonnes N for wheat, respectively. The annual indirect N2O emissions induced by synthetic N fertilizer use from these soil Nr losses are estimated to be 45,000 and 37,000 tonnes for maize and wheat, respectively, with hydrologic pathways playing a predominant role. Enhancing N use efficiency up to 60% for regions below this value can achieve a total soil Nr loss mitigation potential of 4.00 million tonnes per year for the two crops, thereby reducing indirect N2O emissions by 49%. Our results contribute to constrain global N budgets from the use of fertilizer in agriculture, which then can help to improve projections of nitrogen cycle-climate feedbacks using modelling approaches.

AB Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are influenced by land use adjustment and management practices. To meet the increasing socioeconomic development and sustainable demands for food supply, forestland conversion to cropland occurs around the world. However, the effects of forestland conversion to cropland as well as of tillage and fertilization practices on soil N2O emissions are still not well understood, especially in subtropical regions. Therefore, field experiments were carried out to continuously monitor soil N2O emissions after the conversion of forestland to cropland in a subtropical region in Southwest China. One forestland site and four cropland sites were selected: forestland (CK), short-term croplands (tillage with and without fertilization, NC-TF and NC-T), and long-term croplands (tillage with and without fertilization, LC-TF and LC-T). The annual cumulative N2O flux was 0.21 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in forestland. After forestland conversion to cropland, the annual cumulative N2O flux significantly increased by 76-491%. In the short-term and long-term croplands, tillage with fertilization induced cumulative soil N2O emissions that were 94% and 235% higher than those from tillage without fertilization. Fertilization contributed 63% and 84% to increased N2O emissions in the short-term and long-term croplands, respectively. A stepwise regression analysis showed that soil N2O emissions from croplands were mainly influenced by soil NO3- and NH4+ availability and WFPS (water-filled pore space). Fertilization led to higher soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, which thus resulted in larger N2O fluxes. Thus, to reduce soil N2O emissions and promote the sustainable development of the eco-environment, we recommend limiting the conversion of forestland to cropland, and meanwhile intensifying the shift from grain to green or applying advanced agricultural management practices as much as possible.

AB Excessive synthetic N fertilization has resulted in severe soil degradation and high greenhouse gas emissions in agroecosystems. As a promising approach for achieving sustainable agriculture, partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer can affect the stoichiometric balance between organic C and inorganic N, thereby regulating nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. However, the responses of soil N2O emissions and crop productivity to different ratios of organic fertilizer (OF) to synthetic fertilizer (SF) are still unclear, making the optimal fertilization scheme less accurate. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to measure soil properties, N2O emissions, and crop yields in a wheat-maize rotation system. Six fertilization managements were included: no fertilization (CK); total SF; and 15%, 30%, 45%, and 100% of organic substitution for synthetic fertilizers (LO, MO, HO, and OF), respectively. Compared to SF, soil annual cumulative N2O emissions in LO, MO, HO, and OF were significantly reduced by 16.2-20.5%, 28.9-33.9%, 33.2-42.2%, and 70.2-74.9% in two years, respectively. The mitigation of N2O emission with organic substitution was mainly attributed to the decreasing NO3 - and NH4+ contents and increasing soil pH. Meanwhile, soil organic C and total N were considerably higher in HO and OF than other treatments, with the lowest in CK in wheat season and in SF in maize season. Synthetic fertilizer and partial organic substitution increased the annual yield of wheat and maize compared with OF and CK in the first year, and HO increased the annual yield by 9.7% and 37.6% compared with SF and OF in the second year, respectively. The beneficial yield effects were mainly due to the enhanced synchronization of nutrient availability and soil fertility with partial organic substitution. Finally, the yield-scaled N2O emissions were reduced with increasing ratios of organic substitution in two years. Our study suggested that partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer, especially 45% organic substitution would be feasible fertilization strategy to improve soil fertility and crop productivity while mitigating N2O emissions in wheat-maize rotation systems.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas that is released from agricultural ecosystems where nitrogen fertilizers are poorly used and contributes to global climate warming. Large nitrogen fertilizer inputs in summer maize fields on the North China Plain (NCP) lead to large N2O emissions. N2O emissions can be mitigated using 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), but the efficiency and microbial mechanisms of this mitigation at different nitrogen rates remain poorly understood. To evaluate the efficiency of N2O emission mitigation by DMPP at different nitrogen rates and to explore its mechanisms at the microbial level, we monitored the dynamic changes in mineral and N2O fluxes and analysed the abundance and community structure of ammonia oxidizers. We found that DMPP significantly inhibited the oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3-) and thus maintained NH(4)(+)concentrations but decreased the peak value of NO(3)(-)concentrations. Total N2O emissions were increased by 6.5-fold, 13.2-fold and 26.7-fold in fields with 112.5 kg N ha(-1), 225 kg N ha(-1)and 337.5 kg N ha(-1), respectively, compared with fields with no nitrogen applied. Nitrogen increased the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and decreased that of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), whereas DMPP exhibited the opposite effects. Therefore, AOB could be the dominant N2O emission contributors in nitrogen-treated soils. Sequencing results suggested that all AOB belong to theNitrosospiraandNitrosomonas nitrosagroups, and all AOA fell within theNitrososphaeragroup. In both AOB and AOA communities, changes in the second-largest cluster after the application of nitrogen fertilizer and DMPP were more pronounced than those in the largest cluster. The potential functional clusters of AOB and AOA wereNitrosospiracluster 3b andNitrososphaeracluster 4.1, respectively. This study showed that nitrogen and DMPP both affected the abundance and structure of ammonia-oxidizer communities, which may contribute to the variations in N2O emissions from croplands. Highlights
   Role of soil microorganisms in the efficiency of DMPP to reduce N2O emissions under different N inputs was explored. N input increased N2O emissions and DMPP reduced N2O emissions N and DMPP affect N2O emission via a changed key cluster of ammonia oxidizers. DMPP was more efficient at higher nitrogen input levels.

AB The main aim of this paper was to calibrate and evaluate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model for estimating N2O emissions and crop productivity for a summer maize-winter wheat double cropping system with different N fertilizer rates in Hebei, China. The model's performance was assessed before and after calibration and model sensitivity was investigated. The calibrated and validated DNDC performed effectively in estimating cumulative N2O emissions (coefficient of determination (1:1 relationship; r(2)) = 0.91; relative deviation (RD) = -13 to 16%) and grain yields for both crops (r(2) = 0.91; RD = -21 to 7%) from all fertilized treatments, but poorly estimated daily N2O patterns. Observed and simulated results showed that optimal N fertilizer treatment decreased cumulative N2O flux, compared to conventional N fertilizer, without a significant impact on grain yields of the summer maize-winter wheat double cropping system. The high sensitivity of the DNDC model to rainfall, soil organic carbon and temperature resulted in significant overestimation of N2O peaks during the warm wet season. The model also satisfactorily estimated daily patterns/average soil temperature (degrees C; 0-5 cm depth) (r(2) = 0.88 to 0.89; root mean square error (RMSE) = 4 degrees C; normalized RMSE (nRMSE) = 25% and index of agreement (d) = 0.89-0.97) but under-predicted water filled pore space (WFPS; %; 0-20 cm depth) (r(2) = 0.3 to 0.4) and soil ammonium and nitrate (exchangeable NH4+& NO3-; kg N ha(-1); r(2) == 0.97). With reference to the control treatment (no N fertilizer), DNDC was weak in simulating both N2O emissions and crop productivity. To be further improved for use under pedo-climatic conditions of the summer maize-winter wheat double cropping system we suggest future studies to identify and resolve the existing problems with the DNDC, especially with the control treatment.

AB Agricultural production plays an important role in affecting atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Field measurements were conducted in Quzhou County, Hebei Province in the North China Plains to quantify carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a winter wheat-maize rotation field, a common cropping system across the Chinese agricultural regions. The observed flux data in conj. unction with the local climate, soil and management information were utilized to test a process-based model, Denitrification-Decomposition or DNDC, for its applicability for the cropping system. The validated DNDC was then used for predicting impacts of three management alternatives (i.e., no-till, increased crop residue incorporation and reduced fertilizer application rate) on CO2 and N2O emissions from the target field. Results from the simulations indicated that (1) CO2 emissions were significantly affected by temperature, initial SOC, tillage method, and quantity and quality of the organic matter added in the soils; (2) increases in temperature, initial SOC, total fertilizer N input, and manure amendment substantially increased N2O emissions; and (3) temperature, initial SOC, tillage, and quantity and quality of the organic matter added in the soil all had significant effects on global warming. Finally, five 50-year scenarios were simulated with DNDC to predict their long-term impacts on crop yield, soil C dynamics, nitrate leaching losses, and N2O emissions. The modelled results suggested that implementation of manure amendment or crop residue incorporation instead of increased fertilizer application rates would more efficiently mitigate GHG emissions from the tested agro-ecosystem. The multi-impacts provided a Sound basis for comprehensive assessments on the management alternatives. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a major greenhouse gas (GHG) product of intensive agriculture. Fertilizer nitrogen (N) rate is the best single predictor of N2O emissions in row-crop agriculture in the US Midwest. We use this relationship to propose a transparent, scientifically robust protocol that can be utilized by developers of agricultural offset projects for generating fungible GHG emission reduction credits for the emerging US carbon cap and trade market. By coupling predicted N2O flux with the recently developed maximum return to N (MRTN) approach for determining economically profitable N input rates for optimized crop yield, we provide the basis for incentivizing N2O reductions without affecting yields. The protocol, if widely adopted, could reduce N2O from fertilized row-crop agriculture by more than 50%. Although other management and environmental factors can influence N2O emissions, fertilizer N rate can be viewed as a single unambiguous proxy-a transparent, tangible, and readily manageable commodity. Our protocol addresses baseline establishment, additionality, permanence, variability, and leakage, and provides for producers and other stakeholders the economic and environmental incentives necessary for adoption of agricultural N2O reduction offset projects.

AB An important ecological service provided by tropical riparian ecosystems is the mitigation of nutrient pollution (e.g. nitrate) from surrounding agricultural areas. However, a negative impact of this nutrient remediation may be that the ecozone also functions as a major emitter of nitrous oxide (N2O). We hypothesized that the high inorganic nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil water content in tropical riparian ecosystems enhances N2O production through rapid nitrification and denitrification processes. This study was therefore designed to quantify the variability in N2O emissions in such an ecosystem in northern Thailand with specific emphasis on (1) different land uses (comparing replicate leguminous reforestation areas with conventional maize agriculture with high rates of nitrogen fertilizer addition), and (2) temporal aspects (comparing wet and dry seasons). Our aim was to quantify N2O emissions and to identify the major drivers controlling these emissions. Using in situ closed chambers the annual average emissions of N2O from the leguminous reforestation area (3.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1)) was significantly higher than agricultural areas with maize (2.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1))). The seasonal variation results indicated that the rate of N2O flux in the wet season was higher than in the dry season. The variations of N2O emission rates were strongly correlated with water filled pore space (WFPS), denitrification, and microbial biomass C, but not with nitrification. This study indicates that when inorganic N and soil organic C are sufficient, WFPS plays an important role in controlling N2O emissions from denitrification. Comparatively, annual N2O emissions from the tropical riparian reforestation were similar to that reported for temperate riparian forests and other ecosystems. Although the annual N2O emissions from the maize agricultural area were comparable to other crops cultivated in riparian ecosystems, it was higher than the N2O fluxes from crops grown in non-riparian zones. We conclude that agricultural lands located in tropical riparian zones do not represent a major hotspot of N2O emissions and that this does not diminish the positive benefits they provide in relation to other aspects of ecosystem service provision.

AB Irrigation is a common practice used to promote vegetable yields through high agricultural inputs, which potentially increases nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, it is still unclear how an effective irrigation strategy could increase yield by regulating soil water conditions, ultimately mitigating N2O emissions. In this study, negative pressure irrigation (NPI) and furrow irrigation (FI) were applied to control two different soil conditions (i.e., the stable soil water content and the dry-wet cycles) in a vegetable greenhouse growing amaranth (Amaranthus hybridus L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The key objective was to assess the effect of irrigation on vegetable yields and N2O emissions and further reveal their controlling factors. Compared to FI, NPI increased the seasonal stability of soil moisture, NH4+-N, and NO3-N by 11.4%, 26.4%, and 21.2%, respectively. NPI also increased vegetable yields by 16.6%20.3%, whereas the average area-scaled and yield-scaled N2O emissions under NPI were 15.1% and 29.2% lower than FI, respectively. Notably, the N2O emissions could be affected by soil moisture, temperature, NH4+-N, NO3-N, and soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, but the relative importance of these factors was different under the two irrigation systems due to different soil water conditions. The random forest (RF) model showed that soil moisture was the most crucial factor driving N2O flux under FI, whereas soil NO3-N and NH4+-N were the key governing factors under NPI. Overall, this study highlights the importance of increasing seasonal soil water stability for improving the sustainability of irrigation and NPI was a promising irrigation strategy to promote vegetable yields while mitigating N2O emissions.

AB Manure is known to increase soil N2O emissions by stimulating nitrification and denitrification processes. Our objective was to compare soil-surface N2O emissions following the application of liquid and solid dairy cattle manures to a loamy and a clay soil cropped to silage maize. Manures were applied in 2 consecutive years at rates equivalent to 150 kg total N ha(-1) and compared with a control treatment receiving an equivalent rate of synthetic N. Soil-surface N2O fluxes, soil temperature, and soil water, nitrate and ammonium contents were monitored weekly in manured and control plots. From 60 to 90% of seasonal N2O emissions occurred during the first 40 d following manure and synthetic fertilizer applications, indicating that outside that period one or several factors limited N2O emissions. The period of higher emissions following manure and fertilizer application corresponded with the period when soil mineral N contents were highest (up to 17 g NO3- -N m(-2)) and water-filled pore space (WFPS) was greater than 0.5 m(3) m(-3). The absence of significant N2O fluxes later in the growing season despite high WFPS levels indicated that the stimulating effect of organic and synthetic N additions on soil N2O production was relatively short-lived. Fertilization of silage maize with dairy cattle manure resulted in greater or equal N2O emissions than with synthetic N. This was observed despite lower overall soil mineral N contents in the manured plots, indicating that other factors affected by manure, possibly additional C substrates and enhanced soil respiration, resulted in greater denitrification and N2O production. Silage maize yields in the manured soils were lower than those receiving synthetic N, indicating that the N(2)Oemissions per kilogram of harvested biomass were greater for manures than for synthetic N. Our results also suggest that the main source of N2O was nitrification in the loam and denitrification in the clay soil. There was no clear difference in N2O emissions between liquid and solid manures. The variable effects of liquid and solid manure addition on soil N(2)Oemissions reported in the literature likely result from the variable composition of the manures themselves as well as from interactions with other factors such as soil environment and farming practices. A better characterization of the availability of manure C and N is required to assess the impact of manure application on soil N2O emissions under field conditions.

AB Spring maize is one of the most popular crops planted in northeastern China. The cropping systems involving spring maize have been maintaining high production through intensive management practices. However, the high rates of nitrogen (N) fertilizers application could have introduced a great amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. It is crucial for sustaining the maize production systems to reduce N2O emissions meanwhile maintaining the optimum yields by adopting alternative farming management practices. The goal of this study was to evaluate effects of alternative fertilization and crop residue management practices on N2O emission as well as crop yield for a typical maize field in northeastern China. Field experiments were conducted during the 2010-2011 maize growing seasons (from early May to late September) in Liaoning Province, northeastern China. N2O fluxes were measured at the field plots with six different treatments including no N fertilizer use (CK), farmers' conventional N fertilizer application rate (FP), reduced N fertilizer rate (OPT), reduced N fertilizer rate combined with crop straw amendment (OPTS), slow-release N fertilizer (CRF), and reduced N fertilizer rate combined with nitrification inhibitor (OPT+DCD). The static chamber method combined with gas chromatography technique was employed to conduct the measurements of N2O fluxes. The field data showed that N2O emissions varied across the treatments. During the maize growing season in 2010, the total N2O emissions under the treatments of CK, FP, OPT, OPTS, and CRF were 0.63, 1.11, 1.03, 1.26, and 0.98 kg N ha(-1), respectively. The seasonal cumulative N2O emissions were 0.54, 1.07, 0.96, 1.12, and 0.84 kg N ha(-1), respectively, under CK, FP, OPT, OPTS, and OPT+DCD in 2011. In comparison with FP, CRF or OPT+DCD reduced the N2O emissions by 12 or 21%, respectively, while the crop yields remained unchanged. The results indicate that the reduction of N-fertilizer application rate in combination with the slow-release fertilizer type or nitrification inhibitor could effectively mitigate N2O emissions from the tested field. The incorporation of crop residue didn't show positive effect on mitigating N2O emissions from the tested cropping system. The field study can provide useful information for the on-going debate on alternative N fertilization strategies and crop straw management in China. However, further studies would be needed to explore the long-term impacts of the alternative management practices on a wide range of environmental services.

AB Lands under riparian and agricultural management differ in soil properties, water content, plant species and nutrient content and are therefore expected to influence denitrifier communities, denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Denitrifier community abundance, denitrifier community structure, denitrification gene expression and activity were quantified on three dates in a maize field and adjacent riparian zone. N2O emissions were greater in the agricultural zone, whereas complete denitrification to N-2 was greater in the riparian zone. In general, the targeted denitrifier community abundance did not change between agricultural and riparian zones. However, nosZ gene expression was greater in the riparian zone than the agricultural zone. The community structure of nirS-gene-bearing denitrifiers differed in June only, whereas the nirK-gene-bearing community structure differed significantly between the riparian and the agricultural zones at all dates. The nirK-gene-bearing community structure was correlated with soil pH, while no significant correlations were found between nirS-gene-bearing community structure and soil environmental variables or N2O emissions, denitrification or denitrifier enzyme activity. The results suggested for the nirK and nirS-gene-bearing communities different factors control abundance vs. community structure. The nirK-gene-bearing community structure was also more responsive than the nirS-gene-bearing community structure to change between the two ecosystems.

AB Irrigation with waste water adds labile carbon and nitrogen compounds to the soil, and when applied by flooding it rapidly changes the soil's atmosphere and redox potential. In the Mezquital Valley more than 90 000 ha is irrigated with waste water from Mexico City, and enhanced emissions of CO2 and N2O follow each flooding. We measured the emissions of these two gases from a field irrigated periodically with waste water and under three crops, namely alfalfa, rye-grass and maize, using static chambers for 21 months. We also measured emissions from a field growing rain-fed maize before and shortly after two rain events. The data from repeated measurements from the same chambers are correlated in time, and so we modelled the ante-dependence and fitted the models by residual maximum likelihood (REML). The emissions of both CO2 and N2O increased rapidly in response to flood irrigation with peaks up to 448 mg C m(-2) hour(-1) for CO2 and 2.98 mg N m(-2) hour(-1) for N2O under maize. Emissions peaked in particular irrigation events either as the infiltrating water replaced the gas from air-filled pores or several days after irrigation as excess nitrogen and fresh sources of carbon were mineralized. Processes operating during the few days during and immediately after irrigation seem to determine the dynamics of gaseous production in this agricultural ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Agricultural practices are believed to be the major anthropogenic source of enhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) gas emissions in New Zealand. Studies conducted in New Zealand generally suggest low N2O emission from pasture; however, there is little information for arable farming systems. This paper evaluates tillage and land use effects on N2O emissions using a closed chamber technique at an Ohakea silt loam (Gleyic luvisol) where winter oats (Avena sativa L.)/fodder maize (Zea mays L.) was double-cropped for 5 years. The tillage types included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, and a permanent pasture (PP) was used as a control.
   Spatial variability in all treatments showed large inherent variations in N2O fluxes (a mean CV = 119%), which reflected natural soil heterogeneity, and perhaps the measurement technique used rather than the real differences due to the tillage and cropping systems evaluated. On an annualised basis, N2O emissions measured from December 1998 to September 1999 from the PP (1.66 kg N2O-N/ha per year or 19 mug N2O-N/(m(2) h)) were significantly lower than the CT and NT fields averaging at 9.20 (or 105) and 12.0 (or 137) kg N2O-N/ha per year (or mug N2O-N/(m(2) h)), respectively. However, there were no differences in N2O emission rates between the CT and NT treatments. Seedbed preparation using a power harrow which followed within a few days of first ploughing the CT field reduced N2O emissions by 65% within the first hour after power harrowing. However, N2O emission rates returned to the pre-power harrowing levels at the next sampling period, which was 1 month later.
   There was a strong relationship between log-transformed data of soil water content (SWC) and N2O emissions in all treatments with r = 0.73, 0.75 and 0.86 for the PP, CT and NT treatments, respectively. Seasonal variations in N2O emission from the PP were in the order of winter = autumn > summer. Although fluxes in the CT were higher in winter than in the autumn season, there were no differences between the summer and autumn data. The seasonal variations in N2O emission in the NT treatment were in the order of winter > autumn = summer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Land management practices that simultaneously improve soil properties are crucial to high crop production and minimize detrimental impact on the environment. We examined the effects of crop residues on crop performance, the fluxes of soil N2O and CO2 under wheat-maize (WM) and/or faba bean-maize (FM) rotations in Amorpha fruticosa (A) and Vetiveria zizanioides (V) intercropping systems on a loamy clay soil, in subtropical China. Crop performance, soil N2O and CO2 as well as some potential factors such as soil water content, soil carbon, soil nitrogen, microbial biomass and N mineralization were recorded during 2006 maize crop cultivation. Soil N2O and CO2 fluxes are determined using a closed-based chamber. Maize yield was greater after faba bean than after wheat may be due to differences in supply of N from residues. The presence of hedgerow significantly improved maize grain yields. N2O emissions from soils with maize were considerably greater after faba bean (345 g N2O-N ha(-1)) than after wheat (289 g N2O-N ha(-1)). However, the cumulated N2O emissions did not differ significantly between WM and FM. The difference in N2O emissions between WM and FM was mostly due to the amounts of crop residues. Hedgerow alley cropping tended to emit more N2O than WM and FM, in particular A. fruticosa intercropping systems. Over the entire 118 days of measurement, the N2O fluxes represented 534 g N2O-N ha(-1) (AWM) and 512 g N2O-N ha(-1) (AFM) under A. fruticosa species, 403 g N2O-N ha(-1) (VWM) and 423 g N2O-N ha(-1) (VFM) under Vetiver grass. We observed significantly higher CO2 emission in AFM (5,335 kg CO2-C ha(-1)) from June to October, whereas no significant difference was observed among WM (3,480 kg CO2-C ha(-1)), FM (3,302 kg CO2-C ha(-1)), AWM (3,877 kg CO2-C ha(-1)), VWM (3,124 kg CO2-C ha(-1)) and VFM (3,309 kg CO2-C ha(-1)), indicating the importance of A. fruticosa along with faba bean residue on CO2 fluxes. As a result, crop residues and land conversion from agricultural to agroforestry can, in turn, influence microbial biomass, N mineralization, soil C and N content, which can further alter the magnitude of crop growth, soil N2O and CO2 emissions in the present environmental conditions.

AB The mineralization of plant residues results in changes in soil C and N. However, it is difficult to determine the origins of C and N from either soil organic matter mineralization or residue decomposition using traditional methods. An incubation experiment containing two treatments (blank soil (BS) and soil with 6% maize straw (MS)) was conducted to assess the contributions of maize straw to gas emissions, and to soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) using isotopic tracers. About 11.5% of maize straw C was sequestered in soil, the cumulative amount of C emitted from MS was 2.5-fold higher than that in BS treatment. A positive priming effect of maize straw on native SOC in the first 14 days was observed, and then became negative, indicating the potential for a positive balance of SOC storage. Cumulative N2O emissions in MS markedly decreased by 22.4% compared with BS, and the loss of N via N2O in MS was approximately 3.3%. Maize straw significantly increased soil TN and contributed 15.8% to TN at day 120. Our study clearly demonstrated that the different dynamics of C-13 and N-15 in the soils and gases indicated differences of maize straw C and N during decomposition. Maize straw C preferred to contribute to CO2 emissions, while maize straw N contributed more to soil TN.

AB Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, from farmland have been recognized to be affected by soil pH and nitrogen (N) fertilizer application. However, the interactive effects of soil pH and N fertilizer type on N2O emissions and their influencing mechanism are poorly understood. A field experiment was conducted to elucidate the impacts of synthetic fertilizer and manure on soil properties and N2O fluxes along a soil acidity gradient (soil pH = 6.8, 6.1, 5.2, and 4.2) in the Huai River Basin, and a lab incubation experiment was performed to understand the underlying mechanisms of changed N2O flux. Low soil pH inhibited the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria abundance and thereby reduced the N2O production by nitrification under both synthetic fertilizer and manure application. The N2O production by denitrification was also reduced with declining soil pH, likely due to the decreased nirS and nirK abundances, and lower NO3-. However, low soil pH reduced the nosZ abundance and increased (nirS + nirK)/nosZ ratio, resulting in the increased N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratio. Finally, with the decreased nitrification and denitrification, soil N2O emission was significantly reduced with declining soil pH regardless of fertilizer types. Compared with synthetic fertilizer, manure application increased soil nutrients (total N, dissolved organic C, and NO3-), nirK abundance, and (nirS + nirK)/nosZ ratio in the soils with pH of 5.2 and 4.2, thereby promoting N2O production by denitrification and N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio in acidic soils. Consequently, soil N2O emission was increased with manure application in acidic soils. This study provides novel insight and improves our understanding of how soil pH regulates nitrification, denitrification, and N2O emissions from soils amended with chemical fertilizer and manure, which gives guidance on developing N management strategies for sustainable production and N2O mitigation in acid soils.

AB The production and use of biofuels have increased rapidly in recent decades. Bioethanol derived from sugarcane has become a promising alternative to fossil fuel for use in automotive vehicles. The savings' calculated from the carbon footprint of this energy source still generates many questions related to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from sugarcane cultivation. We quantified N2O emissions from soil covered with different amounts of sugarcane straw and determined the direct N2O emission factors of nitrogen fertilizers (applied at the planting furrows and in the topdressing) and the by-products of sugarcane processing (filter cake and vinasse) applied to sugarcane fields. The results showed that the presence of different amounts of sugarcane straw did not change N2O emissions relative to bare soil (control). N-fertilizer increased N2O emissions from the soil, especially when urea was used, both at the planting furrow (plant cane) and during the regrowth process (ratoon cane) in relation to ammonium nitrate. The emission factor for N-fertilizer was 0.46 +/- 0.33%. The field application of filter cake and vinasse favored N2O emissions from the soil, the emission factor for vinasse was 0.65 +/- 0.29%, while filter cake had a lower emission factor of 0.13 +/- 0.04%. The experimentally obtained N2O emission factors associated with sugarcane cultivation, specific to the major sugarcane production region of the Brazil, were lower than those considered by the IPCC. Thus, the results of this study should contribute to bioethanol carbon footprint calculations.

AB The respective contribution of conservation agriculture (CA) principles (no-tillage, permanent soil cover/mulch and crop rotations) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is still unclear. This study was conducted at two long-term experimental sites established in 2013 in Zimbabwe, on an abruptic Lixisol at Domboshava Training Center (DTC) and on a xanthic Ferralsol at the University of Zimbabwe Farm (UZF). The purpose of the study was to unravel the individual and combined effects of tillage, mulching and rotation on N2O and CH4 emissions in low nitrogen (N) input maize-based cropping systems (< 60 kg N ha -1) and to compare emissions within maize rows and between maize rows. We hypothesised that integrating no tillage, mulch and cereal-legume rotation would enhance N2O emissions. Six treatments, replicated four times were investigated: conventional tillage, conven-tional tillage with rotation, no-tillage, no-tillage with mulch, no-tillage with rotation, no-tillage with mulch and rotation. The main crop was maize (Zea mays L.) and treatments with rotation included cowpea (Vigna unguiculate L. Walp.). Gas samples were regularly collected using the static chamber method in the maize row and inter-row spaces during the 2019/20 and 2020/21 cropping seasons and during the 2020/21 dry season. Soil moisture and mineral N were measured in the 0-20 cm soil depth. In 2019/20, cumulative total N2O emissions were signif-icantly higher in mulch treatments at DTC, while at UZF N2O emissions were higher with cowpea rotation. Cumulative total N2O emissions ranged from 215 to 496 g N2O-N ha- 1 yr- 1 and from 226 to 395 g N2O-N ha- 1 yr -1, at DTC and UZF, respectively. In 2020/21, N2O emissions were much lower and no differences were found between treatments on both sites (145 to 179 g N2O-N ha- 1 yr- 1 and 83 to 136 g N2O-N ha- 1 yr- 1 at DTC and UZF, respectively). A significant relationship was found between soil nitrate and daily N2O emissions. At UZF, highest N2O emissions were observed at a water-filled pore space of 60-70%. There were no significant differ-ences in yield-scaled N2O emissions between treatments at both sites for the two seasons. DTC was a net source of CH4 (694 g CH4-C ha- 1 yr- 1 on average), while UZF was a net sink of CH4 (-494 g CH4-C ha- 1 yr- 1 on average). No evidence was found for in situ CH4 production at DTC, and an external source is most likely. Our study in-dicates that for low N input cropping systems in the sub-humid tropics, N loss through N2O is low.

AB Global climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events, which can dramatically alter soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, our ability to predict this effect is limited due to the lack of studies under real-world conditions. We conducted a field experiment in a maize-cultivated black soil in northeast China with six treatments: control without nitrogen (N) application (CK) and N-fertilized treatments with the ratio of urea N to manure N at 100:0 (NPK), 75:25 (OM1), 50:50 (OM2), 25:75 (OM3) and 0:100 (OM4). The experimental year was the wettest on record with an extreme rainfall event of 178 mm occurring in summer 2013. Annual N2O emissions from CK and NPK were increased by 168% and 171%, respectively, relative to normal wet years. Extreme rainfall saturated soils, resulted in low N2O fluxes (<20 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) lasting for 25 d. However, N2O flux peaked (169-264 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) in all treatments as the soil dried. Total N2O emissions were 0.43 -0.74 kg N ha(-1) over the drying period, accounting for 47.5-51.2% of the annual budget. High N2O fluxes occurred when the ratio of soil nitrate (NO3-) to dissolved organic carbon was 0.07-0.10 mg N mg(-1) C, NOT concentration was >3 mg N kg(-1) and water-filled pore space was 67-76%. Distinctly higher N2O fluxes were also identified during the spring thaw period, accumulating to 20.1-49.4% of the non growing season emissions. Emissions upon thawing were likely related to denitrification induced by high moisture conditions as a result of lag effect of the extreme rainfall. Annual N2O emissions progressively reduced as the ratio, of urea N:manure N shifted towards manure, which was also the case during soil drying after waterlogging. Total N2O emissions were reduced by 25.6% for OM4 than NPK. Overall, our results suggest that soil N2O emissions were increased in the record wet year but a shift from urea towards manure with more N applied as starter N can minimize the N2O losses.

AB Conservation tillage can improve soil health and carbon sequestration and is helpful for sustainable agricultural development. However, its effect on crop yields and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is still controversial. In this study, a two-year field experiment of spring maize was conducted from 2019 to 2020 in the Phaeozems region of Northeast China, involving two tillage practices (strip tillage and conventional tillage) and two nitrogen inhibitors (N-butylthiophosphorotriamine, NBPT and 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate, DMPP). The WHCNS (Soil Water Heat Carbon Nitrogen Simulator) model was calibrated and validated with field observations, and the effects of different tillage practices and nitrification inhibitors on spring maize yield, N2O emissions, water use efficiency (WUE), and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were simulated using the WHCNS model. Precipitation scenarios were set up to simulate and analyze the changes in patterns of crop yield and N2O emissions under long-term conservation tillage for 30 years (1991-2020). The results showed that concerning maize yield, under conservation tillage, the type of straw and nitrogen fertilizer inhibitor could explain 72.1% and 7.1%, respectively, of the total variance in maize yield, while precipitation explained only 14.1% of the total variance, with a 28.5% increase in crop yield in a humid year compared to a dry year. N2O emissions were principally influenced by precipitation, which could explain 46.4% of the total variance in N2O emissions. Furthermore, N2O emissions were 385% higher in humid years than in dry years. Straw under conservation tillage and inhibitor type explained 8.1% and 19.4% of the total variance in N2O emissions, respectively. Conservation tillage with nitrification inhibitors is recommended to increase crop yields, improve soil quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Phaeozems region of Northeast China, thus ensuring sustainable agricultural development in the region.

AB Corn (Zea mays L.) is grown across vast acreages producing massive quantities of stover making corn a desirable cellulosic bioenergy feedstock. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) so small changes in direct soil N2O emissions may have substantial influence on global warming potential (GWP) from the agricultural sector. Harvesting stover alters soil properties such as soil moisture, oxygen availability, temperature, and substrate availability (C and N). Thus, harvesting stover might reduce soil N2O emissions by reducing substrate and by warming and drying the soil. The goal of the study was to determine how harvesting corn stover altered soil N2O emissions. Therefore, soil N2O emissions were measured for four crop-years (planting to planting) in two independent studies, one in a field managed without tillage (NT1995) and the other was in a field tilled annually with a chisel plow (Chisel). Each field was in a cornsoybean (Glycine max L. [Merr.]) rotation, with (i) corn grain (Grain) only, (ii) grain plus about 50% of the stover harvested (Grain+ Moderate), and (iii) grain plus harvesting as much stover as possible (Grain+ Aggressive) treatments. Cumulative soil N2O emissions did not differ among treatments in either field during any of the crop-years monitored. Flux events occurred corresponding to fertilizer applications and to spring freeze-thaw events. Cumulative fertilizer stimulated emissions tended to be greater for corn than soybean because of N-fertilizer application. These results are valuable to modelers for enhancing estimates of the N2O component of the stover management C-footprint.

AB Emissions of nitrogen compounds (NO, NH3, N2O and N-2) from heavily fertilized (280 kg(N) ha(-1)) and irrigated maize fields were studied over an annual cultivation cycle in southwestern France. NO and N2O emissions were measured by chamber techniques throughout the year. During fertilization and maize growth periods, chamber measurements were intensified and complemented by flux-gradient micrometeorological measurements of NOx and NH3. The two methods used, Bowen ratio and a simplified aerodynamical techniques, agree quite well and quantify NOx and NH3 flux variations during the period of intense emission which followed fertilizer application. Over a yearly cycle, nitrogen loss in the form of NH3, NO and N2O were calculated using micrometeorological flux measurements and emission algorithms calibrated with field data (chambers). The soil denitrification potential represented by the ratio N2O/(N2O+N-2) was measured in the laboratory to calculate potential total gaseous nitrogen loss. Taking into account all uncertainties, the total N loss into the atmosphere represents 30 to 110 kg(N) ha(-1) with about less than 1% as NH3, 40% as NO, 14% as N2O and 46% as N-2. This is in agreement with the agronomic nitrogen budget based on the N fertilizer input and soil furniture and, on the N-output by crops and crop residues, which displays a net imbalance of 50 to 100 kg(N) ha(-1).

AB Emissions of N2O from maize fields irrigated and fertilised with 200 kg N ha(-1) were measured using several chamber and micrometeorological techniques at a single site in the Landes de Gascogne (France). The methods were compared over similar periods, but the sampling areas covered range from 0.18 m(2) for the chamber methods to 10(4)-10(5) m(2) for the micrometeorological methods. Nitrous oxide concentration was measured using electron capture gas chromatography (GC) for the chamber technique. Micrometeorological fluxes were determined by eddy covariance and gradient methods with N2O mixing ratios measured using fast-response tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. The spatial heterogeneity of N2O emissions was studied with a set of 30 closed chambers. This study showed an anisotropic distribution of N2O emissions which was attributed to the pattern of fertiliser application. A sensitivity analysis of the micrometeorological techniques indicated that uncertainties on Aux assessment are mainly due to spatial heterogeneity of N2O emissions. Fluxes measured using chamber and micrometeorological techniques were compared over a 2 h period. Depending on the precision of the techniques, good agreement between the magnitude of the fluxes measured by chamber and micrometeorological methods was observed. For micrometeorological methods, the Aux ranged from 20 to 400 ng N-N2O m(-2) s(-1) and from 25 to 275 ng N-N2O m(-2) s(-1) for chamber method. Average relative variations of the Aux were similar in both methods, and were mainly dependent on the soil water content. Using micrometeorological measurements, large variations of the flux were observed from 1 h to the next related to variations in the wind direction combined with spatial heterogeneity.

AB Our experiment evaluated the effect of maize and peanut mulched residues upon soil organic matter and denitrifying community over a five-week incubation in soil microcosms. Soil organic matter under peanut and maize debris contrasted in biochemical quality throughout incubation, despite identical soil C contents that were significantly increased by both organic amendments. Moreover, only soluble extracts originating from the peanut treated soils could significantly fuel semi-potential denitrification. Accordingly, the composition of the nirK and nosZ communities was also specifically affected by mulch type, and the strongest impact was registered within the nosZ gene-bearing denitrifiers under peanut residues. Residue enriched soils displayed temporal patterns of potential denitrification activity that were also dependant on residue type. The highest overall emission rates were recorded with soils under maize mulch but they were not mirrored by direct N2O contents of the microcosm's headspace. Overall, both soil organic matter and denitrifiers community changes were conditioned throughout the decomposition kinetics by the original quality of mulched crop residues. However, the denitrification activity was decoupled both from the composition of the denitrifying community and from the soil organic matter quality.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were measured and compared on 2 typical crop rotations of a grain farm and a dairy farm with feed cropping, over 5 years (from 2012 to 2016) in southwestern France. The annual N2O emissions of the 5 typical rotational crops of the region (summer crops: irrigated maize and sunflower; winter crops: winter wheat, rapeseed and barley) varied from 0.95 +/- 0.88 to 7.96 +/- 1.73 kgN ha-1, with the highest values observed on the dairy farm plot and for summer crops. N2O emissions were analysed on a daily, monthly, seasonal and annual basis, and correlated with their main direct or indirect drivers, i. e. water and nitrogen (mineral or organic) supply amount, rotational crops, vegetation covering and tillage. We observed a marked seasonal pattern of N2O emission peaks. On average, more than 50% of N2O emissions occurred during spring for summer crops, and more than 40% occurred in winter for winter crops. We have identified agricultural practices that increase N2O emissions. In particular, our results show that when the soil is left bare or with limited crop development, spring mineralization of organic N residues (from previous crop or winter cover crop) results in N losses, partly as emissions of N2O, which are detrimental to agronomic performance (low NUE).We also conducted an agronomic assessment of annual N2O emissions versus nitrogen surplus and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), which lead us to discuss agricultural practices that may mitigate N2O emissions while optimizing agronomic and economic performance of crops. Indeed, we point out that N surplus and N fate may be controlled through the right timing of sowing, cover crop, irrigation and fertilization.

AB Erosion is a key driver of topsoil removal in agriculture, resulting in nutrient losses and leaving truncated soil profiles on shoulder slopes, where subsoil material can be incorporated into topsoil by the plough, changing soil properties and, thus, altering biogeochemical cycling and associated nitrogen (N) losses. To date, the effects of topsoil erosion on N cycling have rarely been investigated. We conducted a short-term mesocosm experiment, integrating N-15 tracing techniques to quantify N transformation processes, focusing on N availability and N losses in three artificially eroded agricultural topsoils. Nitrogen transformation pathways were simulated using the numerical model Ntrace, considering N uptake by maize (Zea mays L.) at early development stages. The N-15 label also allows the quantification of nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N-2) losses by applying the N-15 gas flux method ((15)NGF). Erosion induced topsoil dilution significantly reduced gross N turnover and consequently N2O and N-2 emissions in both treatments with and without plants. The oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3-) was by far the dominating N pathway across all investigated topsoils, followed by N-org mineralization > NH4+ immobilization. However, more than 90 % of total N2O losses derived from the NO3- pool, with coupled nitrification-denitrification assumed to be the dominant process at water contents of similar to 40 % water-filled pore space (WFPS). Although maize more than doubled N2O + N-2 emissions in some treatments, the overall effect of topsoil dilution on gaseous N losses was considerably greater, independent of maize presence. Our study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of N cycling in erosion-affected agricultural soils, which is essential for enhancing N fertilizer use efficiencies and reducing N pollution.

AB Agroecosystems face double pressures of producing more food to feed growing global population and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate climate change. The Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) plain produces similar to 1/3 wheat and maize of China with very high resource inputs, particularly synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers since the 1980 s. Although fertilizer input has substantially increased crop yield and enhanced biomass carbon (C) input to the soil and thus stimulating soil C sequestration, GHG emissions (e.g., nitrous oxide (N2O)) relating to the fertilizers have been also dramatically increased. Yet, a systematic regional assessment on the trade-offs between crop yield, soil C sequestration and N2O emissions as impacted by management practices and environmental conditions is lacking. Here we calibrated a fanning system model to conduct comprehensive assessment on crop yield and GHG emissions (soil CO2 and N2O emissions) during the period 1981-2010 across the HHH plain at the resolution of 10 km. We found that soil in HHH plain was a C sink with an annual C sequestration rate of 1.53 CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (0-30 cm soil layer) during the period under current typical agricultural practices, but this sink could only offset about 68% of global warming potential from contemporary N2O emissions. By reducing the annual N input rate (from current more than 300 to similar to 250 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and enhancing crop residue retention rate (from current 30% to 100%), the HHH plain could act as a net sink of GHG without sacrificing grain yield. Apart from management, the effects of three key environmental factors, i.e., mean annual rainfall and temperature and initial soil organic carbon stock on dynamics of crop yield, soil CO2 and N2O emissions were also studied. The results will have important implications for the development of management strategies to maintain yield while reducing GHG emissions.

AB Studies on the CO2 and N2O emission patterns of agricultural soils under different ploughing practices may provide an insight into the potential and magnitude of CO2 and N2O mitigation in highly managed farmland soils. In this study, field measurements of soil respiration and N2O flux with different ploughing depths were performed in the 2003-04 wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), 2004 maize (Zea mays L.), and 2004-05 wheat seasons. Soil temperature and moisture were simultaneously measured. Results showed that, in each cropping season, the seasonal variation in soil respiration developed with a similar pattern for different treatments, which was primarily regulated by soil temperature. This work demonstrates that ploughing depth can influence long-term loss of carbon from soil, but this was contingent on preceding cropping types. Given the same preceding cropping practice, no significant difference in N2O emission was found among different ploughing depths in each cropping season.

AB Nitrogen (N)-fixing tree and crop intercropping systems can be a sustainable agricultural practice in sub-Saharan Africa and can also contribute to resolving climate change through enhancing soil carbon (C) sequestration. A study conducted by Makumba et al. (Agric Ecosyst Environ 118:237-243, 2007) on the N-fixing tree gliricidia and maize intercropping system in southern Malawi provides a rare dataset of both sequestered soil C and C loss as soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, no soil C gain and loss estimates were made so the study failed to show the net gain of soil C. Also absent from this study was potential benefit or negative impact related to the other greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from the intercropping system. Using the data provided in Makumba et al. (Agric Ecosyst Environ 118:237-243, 2007) a C loss as soil CO2 emissions (51.2 +/- A 0.4 Mg C ha(-1)) was estimated, amounting to 67.4% of the sequestered soil C (76 +/- A 8.6 Mg C ha(-1) in 0-2 m soil depth) for the first 7 years in the intercropping system. An annual net gain of soil C of 3.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) was estimated from soil C sequestered and lost. Inclusion of the potential for N2O mitigation [0.12-1.97 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1), 0.036-0.59 Mg CO2 equivalents (eq.) ha(-1) year(-1)] within this intercropping system mitigation as CO2 eq. basis was estimated to be 3.5-4.1 Mg CO2 eq. ha(-1) year(-1). These results suggest that reducing N2O emission can significantly increase the overall mitigation benefit from the intercropping system. However, significant uncertainties are associated with estimating the effect of intercropping on soil N2O and CH4 emissions. These results stress the importance of including consideration of quantifying soil CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions when quantifying the C sequestration potential in intercropping system.

AB The aim of this study was to compare the effects of cowpea green manure and inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizers on yields of winter wheat and soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). The comparisons included cowpea grown solely as green manure where all biomass was terminated at maturity by tillage, summer fallow treatments with 90 kg N ha(-1)as urea (90-N), and no fertilization (control) at planting of winter wheat. Fluxes of N2O were measured by closed chamber methods after soil incorporation of cowpea in autumn (October-November) and harvesting of winter wheat in summer (June-August). Growth and yields of winter wheat and N concentrations in grain and straw were also measured. Cowpea produced 9.5 Mg ha(-1)shoot biomass with 253 kg N ha(-1)at termination. Although soil moisture was favorable for denitrification after soil incorporation of cowpea biomass, low concentrations of soil mineral N restricted emissions of N2O from cowpea treatment. However, increased concentrations of soil mineral N and large rainfall-induced emissions were recorded from the cowpea treatment during summer. Growth of winter wheat, yield, and grain N concentrations were lowest in response to cowpea treatment and highest in 90-N treatment. In conclusion, late terminated cowpea may reduce yield of winter wheat and increase emissions of N2O outside of wheat growing seasons due to poor synchronization of N mineralization from cowpea biomass with N-demand of winter wheat.

AB The aims of this study were to determine type and application rate of composted animal manure to optimize sweet potato yield relative to N2O emissions from upland soils. To this end, the study was conducted on upland soils amended with different types and rates of composted animal manure and located at two geographically different regions of South Korea. Field trials were established at Miryang and Yesan in South Korea during the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) growing season over 2 years: 2017 (Year 1) and 2018 (Year 2). Three composted animal manures (chicken, cow, and pig) were applied at the rates of 0,10, and 20 Mg ha(-1) to upland soils in both locations. In both Years and locations, manure type did not affected significantly cumulative N2O emissions from soil during the sweet potato growing season or the belowground biomass of sweet potato. However, application rate of animal manures affected significantly the cumulative N2O emission, nitrogen (N) in soil, and belowground biomass of sweet potato. An increase in cumulative N2O emission with application rates of animal manures was related to total N and inorganic N concentration in soil. The belowground biomass yield of sweet potato but also the cumulative N2O emission increased with increasing application rate of composted animal manures up to 7.6 and 16.0 Mg ha(-1) in Miryang and Yesan, respectively. To reduce N2O emission from arable soil while increasing crop yield, composted animal manures should be applied at less than application rate that produce the maximum belowground biomass of sweet potato.

AB Using an enclosed chamber technique, N2O emissions from intensively cultivated soils in the North China Plain were measured during periods fi om October 1995 to September 1996 and June 1997 to June 1998, to reflect distinct contributions of the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons. The results show that the measured annual mean emission of N2O from soils treated with chemical N Fertilizer and from soils treated with chemical N fertilizer combined with organic manure were 52.8 and 61.4 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. These emissions from fertilized soils were significantly higher right after the chemical fertilizer was applied. A relatively low annual mean emission of 2.2 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1) was measured in soils that had not been Fertilized for 12 years. Maximal annual emissions of N2O from the studied agroecosystem were 3.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1). The results indicate that the application of organic manure also had a significant effect on N2O emissions, which combined with the use of chemical N fertilizer increased about 20% over the whole year. A weak correlation was found between N2O emissions and soil available NH4+ N content. Average annual N2O emission from fertilized soils was estimated to be 57.1 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1), which is in good agreement with the average emission of 52.7 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1) reported in other fertilized soil Bur studies at different locations in China.

AB Agricultural activities contribute almost half of the total anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) 2 O) emissions, but proper assessment of mitigation measures is hampered by large uncertainties during the quantification of cropland N2O 2 O emissions and mitigation potentials. This review summarizes the up-to-date datasets and approaches to provide spatially explicit and crop-specific assessment of the global mitigation potentials. Here, we show that global cropland N2O 2 O emissions have quadrupled to 1.2 Tg N2O-N 2 O-N year- 1 over 1961-2020. The mitigation potential is 0.7 Tg N2O-N 2 O-N without compromising the crop production, with 86% from optimizing nitrogen fertilization, three-quarters (78%) from maize (22%), vegetables, and fruits (16%), other crops (15%), wheat (13%), and rice (12%), and over 80% from South Asia, China, the European Union, other American countries, the United States, and Southeast Asia. More accurate estimation of cropland N2O 2 O mitigation potentials requires extending the N2O 2 O observation network, improving modeling capacity, quantifying the feasibility of mitigation measures, and seeking additional mitigation measures.

AB Nitrification inhibitors, originally proposed for nitrate leaching mitigation, are recommended as effective nitrous oxide (N2O) mitigation strategies. Several compounds have been trialled and used in the past including dicyandiamide (DCD) or 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Yet, little is known about the new nitrification inhibitor 2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA). A field experiment using N-15 single-labelled ammonium nitrate ((NH4NO3)-N-15 or (NH4NO3)-N-15) was conducted to understand the effectiveness of DMPSA on a biochemical basis in an irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) crop. Gaseous fluxes, i.e. N2O, (N2O)-N-15, N-15(2), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) were measured, as well as soil mineral N, yield components and N-15 recovery in plant and soil. During the maize cropping period, the use of DMPSA significantly reduced cumulative N2O emissions (118 g N ha(-1)) compared to ammonium nitrate without inhibitor (231 g N ha(-1)). The N-15 analyses revealed that most N2O losses (particularly during the emission peak) came from (NH4NO3)-N-15 (i.e. nitrification, nitrifier denitrification and/or coupled nitrification denitrification) rather than (NH4NO3)-N-15 in this calcareous low C-content soil. As expected, DMPSA decreased N2O losses from (NH4+)-N-15 oxidation, but an effect on non-target microorganisms was noticed, as shown by the significant reduction of respiration rates and N2O losses coming from (NO3-)-N-15. No significant effect of DMPSA on CH4 oxidation or N-15(2) fluxes was observed. The DMPSA did not lead to a significant improvement of the dry weights of grain or biomass, although an increment of root biomass by 64% was found. This compound also tended to increase plant N recovery (average 67.8%) and to decrease soil N recovery (average 18.3%) but differences were not statistically significant. Conversely, the nitrification inhibitor significantly reduced the residual fertilizer-N in the 15-30 cm and 30-45 cm soil layers. The use of DMPSA was confirmed as a highly effective tool to reduce N2O emissions from irrigated crops in semi-arid areas.

AB The spatial and temporal distribution of water and nitrogen supply affects soil-borne nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. In this study, the effects of different irrigation technologies (no irrigation, sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation) and nitrogen (N) application types (no fertilizer, broadcasted and within irrigation water) on N2O flux rates and the quantities of functional genes involved in the N cycle in potato cropping were investigated over an entire season. The volume of irrigation water affected microbial N2O production, with the highest N2O flux rates found under sprinkler irrigation conditions, followed by drip and no irrigation. Nitrifier denitrification was identified as the potential pre-dominant pathway stimulated by fluctuations in aerobic-anaerobic soil conditions, especially under sprinkler irrigation. Regarding the different N application types, increased N use efficiency under fertigation was expected. However, N2O flux rates were not significantly reduced compared to broadcasted N application under drip irrigation. On average, the N2O fluxes were higher during the first half of the season, which was accompanied by a low N use efficiency of the potato crops. Potato crops mainly require N at later growth stages. Due to the different water and nutrient demand of potatoes, an adjusted application of fertilizer and water based on crop demand could reduce N2O emissions.

TI A 4-year field measurement of N2O emissions from a

AB Soil N2O emissions depend on the status of stoichiometric balance between organic C and inorganic N. As a beneficial management practice to sustain soil fertility and crop productivity, partial substitution of organic fertilizers (OFs) for synthetic fertilizers (SFs) can directly affect this balance status and regulate N2O emissions. However, no multi-year field studies of N2O emissions under different ratios of OFs to SFs have been performed. We conducted a 4-year experiment to measure N2O emissions in a maize-wheat rotation in central China. Six treatments were included: total SF (TS), total OF, no N fertilizer, and ratios of to SF with 1: 2 (LO), 1: 1 (MO), and 2: 1 (HO), based on N content. Two incubation experiments were performed to further interpret the field data. In the first year, cumulative N2O emissions (kg N ha(-1)) in LO, MO, and HO were 4.59, 4.68, and 3.59, respectively, significantly lower than in TS (6.67). However, from the second year onwards, organic substitution did not reduce N2O emissions and even significantly enhanced them in the fourth year relative to TS. Soil respiration under OF-amended soils increased over the course of the experiment. From the second year onwards, there was no marked difference in mineral N concentrations between OF- and SF-amended soils. OF caused a drop in soil pH. Cumulative N2O was negatively correlated with pH. Long-term organic substitution enhanced N2O emissions produced via denitrification rather than nitrification and resulted in higher temperature sensitivity of N2O emissions than TS. The enhanced N2O emissions from the OF-treated soils were mainly attributable to accelerated OF decomposition, increased denitrification-N2O emissions, and lessened N2O reduction due to lower pH and greater NO3-. These results indicate that OF substitution can reduce N2O emissions in the first year, but in the long-term it can increase emissions, especially as soils warm.

AB Reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agriculture is critical to limiting future global warming. In response, a growing number of food retailers and manufacturers have committed to reducing N2O emissions from their vast networks of farmer suppliers by providing technical assistance and financial incentives. A key challenge for such companies is demonstrating that their efforts are leading to meaningful progress toward their climate mitigation commitments. We show that a simplified version of soil surface nitrogen (N) balance-or partial N balance-the difference between N inputs to and outputs from a farm field (fertilizer N minus crop N), is a robust indicator of direct N2O emissions from fields with maize and other major rainfed temperate-region crops. Furthermore, we present a generalized environmental model that will allow food-supply-chain companies to translate aggregated and anonymized changes in average N balance across their supplying farms into aggregated changes in N2O emissions. This research is an important first step, based on currently available science, in helping companies demonstrate the impact of their sustainability efforts.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) contributes to global climate change, and its emission from soil-crop systems depend on soil, environmental, and anthropogenic factors. Thus, we evaluated the variability of N2O emissions measured by microchambers (cross section: 184 cm(2)) from a groundnut-fallow-maize-fallow cropping system of the humid tropics. The crops received inorganic nitrogen (N) plus crop residues (NC), inorganic N alone as ammonium sulfate (RN), and half of the inorganic N along with crop residues and chicken manure (N1/2CM), amounting for the crop rotation to 322, 180, and 400 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The N2O fluxes during the groundnut-maize crop rotation were log-normally distributed, and the frequency distributions were positively skewed. Daytime changes in N2O fluxes were inconsistent, and the 50% of total N2O emission during the 12 h measurement periods was attained earlier under maize (-11 : 00 h) than groundnut covers (- 13: 00 h). Spatial variability in each treatment with eight gas chambers was large but smaller during the cropping periods than the fallow, indicating masking efficiency of crop covers for the soil heterogeneity that was accelerated presumably by antecedent climatic variables. The temporal variability of N2O emissions was also large (coefficients of variation, CV, ranged from 60 to 81%), involving both input differences between treatments and measurement periods. As such, the relative deviation from the annual mean of total N2O emission was high during the period after a large N application with a maximum of +480%, due to addition of chicken manure. The seasonal contribution of summer and monsoon to N2O emissions was insignificant. However, intensive rainfall negatively (-0.65**) and the amount of added N from either source positively (0.83***) correlated with the integrated N2O emissions, and those were exponential. Results suggest that around noon (12: 00 h) gas collection could represent well the daily N2O fluxes, increasing the number or size of the gas chambers could minimize the large variability, and mainly the rainfall and N inputs regulated its emissions in the humid tropics of Malaysia.

AB Crop intensification is often thought to increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but studies in which crop management is optimized to exploit crop yield potential are rare. We conducted a field study in eastern Nebraska, USA to quantify GHG emissions, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and the net global warming potential (GWP) in four irrigated systems: continuous maize with recommended best management practices (CC-rec) or intensive management (CC-int) and maize-soybean rotation with recommended (CS-rec) or intensive management (CS-int). Grain yields of maize and soybean were generally within 80-100% of the estimated site yield potential. Large soil surface carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were mostly associated with rapid crop growth, high temperature and high soil water content. Within each crop rotation, soil CO2 efflux under intensive management was not consistently higher than with recommended management. Owing to differences in residue inputs, SOC increased in the two continuous maize systems, but decreased in CS-rec or remained unchanged in CS-int. N2O emission peaks were mainly associated with high temperature and high soil water content resulting from rainfall or irrigation events, but less clearly related to soil NO3-N levels. N2O fluxes in intensively managed systems were only occasionally greater than those measured in the CC-rec and CS-rec systems. Fertilizer-induced N2O emissions ranged from 1.9% to 3.5% in 2003, from 0.8% to 1.5% in 2004 and from 0.4% to 0.5% in 2005, with no consistent differences among the four systems. All four cropping systems where net sources of GHG. However, due to increased soil C sequestration continuous maize systems had lower GWP than maize-soybean systems and intensive management did not cause a significant increase in GWP. Converting maize grain to ethanol in the two continuous maize systems resulted in a net reduction in life cycle GHG emissions of maize ethanol relative to petrol-based gasoline by 33-38%. Our study provided evidence that net GHG emissions from agricultural systems can be kept low when management is optimized toward better exploitation of the yield potential. Major components for this included (i) choosing the right combination of adopted varieties, planting date and plant population to maximize crop biomass productivity, (ii) tactical water and nitrogen (N) management decisions that contributed to high N use efficiency and avoided extreme N2O emissions, and (iii) a deep tillage and residue management approach that favored the build-up of soil organic matter from large amounts of crop residues returned.

AB Agricultural soil with fertilization is a main anthropogenic source for atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O fluxes from a maize-wheat rotation field in the North China Plain (NCP) were investigated for 4 successive years using the static chamber method. The annual N2O fluxes from the control (without fertilization) and fertilization plots were 1.5 +/- 0.2 and 9.4 +/- 1.7 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2008-2009, 2.0 +/- 0.01 and 4.0 +/- 0.03 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2009-2010, 1.3 +/- 0.02 and 5.0 +/- 0.3 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2010-2011, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 and 12.5 +/- 0.1 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2011-2012, respectively. Annual direct emission factors (EFd's) in the corresponding years were 2.4 +/- 0.5 %, 0.60 +/- 0.01 %, 1.1 +/- 0.09% and 2.9 +/- 0.2 %, respectively. Significant linear correlation between fertilized-induced N2O emissions (Y, kgNha(-1)) during the periods of 10 days after fertilization and rainfall intensities from 4 days before to 10 days after fertilization (X, mm) in the 4 years was found as Y = 0.048X - 1.1 (N = 4, R-2 = 0.99, P < 0.05). Therefore, the remarkable interannual variations of N2O emissions and the EFd's were mainly ascribed to the rainfall.

AB Atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, with long atmospheric residence time and a global warming potential 273 times higher than CO2. N2O emissions are mainly produced from soils and are influenced by biotic and abiotic factors that can be substantially altered by anthropogenic activities, such as land uses, especially when unmanaged natural ecosystems are replaced by croplands or other uses. In this study, we evaluated the spatial variability of N2O emissions from croplands (maize, soybean, wheat, and sugar cane crops), paired with the natural grasslands or forests that they replaced across a wide environmental gradient in Argentina, and identified the key drivers governing the spatial variability of N2O emissions using structural equation modeling. We conducted on-farm field measurements over 2 years at nine different sites, including a wide environmental gradient (mean rainfall from 679 to 1090 mm year-1 and mean temperatures from 13.8 degrees C to 21.3 degrees C), with diverse plant species life forms, and ecosystems, from the Semiarid Chaco forests in the Northwest of Argentina to the Pampas grasslands in the Southeast. On average, agricultural systems emitted more than twice N2O (+120%), had higher soil water content (+9%), higher soil temperatures (+3%), higher soil nitrate content (+19%) but lower ammonium (-33%) than natural ecosystems. We found that land use was the main driver of N2O emissions by directly affecting soil NO3- contents in both natural ecosystems and croplands. Urgent management practices aimed at reducing N2O emissions from croplands are needed to mitigate their contributions to global climate change.

AB Amending agricultural soils with organic residues is frequently recommended to improve soil fertility and to sequester carbon for counteracting global warming. However, such amendments will enhance microbial respiration, hence denitrification. Therefore, the assessment of effects on global warming must take N2O emission and the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio of denitrification into account. There are some indications that the product ratio of denitrification is positively correlated with the ratio of available NO3- and available organic C in soils, but more research is needed to unravel quantitative relationships in well defined experiments. We conducted two laboratory incubation experiments, with the objective (i) to test the impact of the application of various N containing organic substrates including biogas residue on the denitrification rate and on N2O emission, and (ii) to investigate the effect of various NO3- concentrations on the denitrification rate and the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio under standardized anoxic conditions in soils collected from long-term organic or inorganic fertilizer plots. In experiment 1, we found that biogas residue was more recalcitrant than maize straw, despite a high concentration of soluble organic C. High respiration (treatments with maize straw and sucrose) resulted in a transient peak in N2O emission, declining rapidly towards zero as nitrate concentrations reached less than 20 mg NO3--N kg(-1) dry soil. Application of biogas residue had a more moderate effect on soil respiration and denitrification, and resulted in a more long lasting peak in N2O emission. The results were interpreted as a result of a gradual increase in the relative activity of N2O reductase (thus lowering of the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio of denitrification) throughout the incubation, most likely controlled by concentration of available NO3- in soil. In the second experiment, we found low N2O/(N2O N-2) product ratios for the treatment where NO3- concentrations were <= 2 mM, and the ratios were clearly lower in manure fertilized than in mineral fertilizer treated soil. Much higher N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratios were found for the treatments with >= 10 mM NO3-, and the ratios were remarkably independent of the soil's fertilizer history. We conclude that (i) in N-fertilized agricultural soils, application of organic matter with high contents of labile C may trigger denitrification-derived N2O emission whereas (ii) in soils with low NO3- contents such application may substantially lower the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio and hence N2O emission.

AB Agricultural soils in semiarid Mediterranean areas are characterized by low organic matter contents and low fertility levels. Application of crop residues and/or manures as amendments is a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to overcome this problem. However, these management practices may induce important changes in the nitrogen oxide emissions from these agroecosystems, with additional impacts on carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, a field experiment was carried out with a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) crop under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effect of combining maize (Zea mays L.) residues and N fertilizer inputs (organic and/or mineral) on these emissions.
   Crop yield and N uptake, soil mineral N concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), denitrification capacity, N2O, NO and CO2 fluxes were measured during the growing season.
   The incorporation of maize stover increased N2O emissions during the experimental period by c. 105 %. Conversely, NO emissions were significantly reduced in the plots amended with crop residues. The partial substitution of urea by pig slurry reduced net N2O emissions by 46 and 39 %, with and without the incorporation of crop residues respectively. Net emissions of NO were reduced 38 and 17 % for the same treatments. Molar DOC:NO (3) (-) ratio was found to be a robust predictor of N2O and NO fluxes.
   The main effect of the interaction between crop residue and N fertilizer application occurred in the medium term (4-6 month after application), enhancing N2O emissions and decreasing NO emissions as consequence of residue incorporation. The substitution of urea by pig slurry can be considered a good management strategy since N2O and NO emissions were reduced by the use of the organic residue.

AB Straw returning not only improves carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools but also increases soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which poses a threat to the sustainable development of agriculture. To investigate the effect of straw return combined with nitrogen fertilizer on labile C and N pools in the soil and short-term response to soil N2O emissions in wheat-maize rotation system. The consecutive field experiment was conducted from 2019 to 2021. Single factor randomized block design was used in the experiment design, with no straw returning and no fertilizer (CK), no straw returning and nitrogen fertilizer (S0N) and straw returning combined with nitrogen fertilizer (SN). The results indicated that the SN and S0N treatments significantly (p < .05) increased N2O emissions by 170.45% (2.43 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and 119.5% (1.70 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), soil organic carbon (SOC) by 17.23% and 14.50% and soil total nitrogen (STN) by 58.50% and 31.50% respectively. In the 2020-2021 growing season, The soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) content of the SN and S0N treatments were higher than those of CK in the winter wheat seedling, winter wheat jointing, winter wheat booting, summer maize seedling and summer maize bell-mouth stages. The structural equation model (SEM) indicated that C:N and NO3--N were the major drivers that increased soil N2O emissions, but SMBN was the main driver that decreased soil N2O emissions. The SN and S0N treatments significantly increased soil N2O emissions by increasing the NO3--N content. However, compared with the CK and S0N treatments, the SN treatment mitigated soil N2O emissions by increasing the SMBN content. More importantly, compared with CK treatment, SN treatment increased annual yield by 48.41% and 34.52%, the SN treatment could effectively improve the soil C and N pools. Therefore, straw return combined with nitrogen fertilizer (SN) may be the best choice of the treatments tested for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving green and sustainable development.

AB One-year winter wheat-summer maize rotation is the most popular double cropping system in north-central China, and this highly productive system is an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions due to the high fertilizer N and irrigation water inputs. To sustain the high crop production and mitigate the detrimental impacts of N2O and NO emissions, improved management practices are extensively applied. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the effects of an improved management practice of irrigation, fertilization and crop straw on grain yield and N2O and NO emissions for a wheat-maize rotation field in northern China. Using automated and manual chamber measuring systems, we monitored N2O and NO fluxes for the conventional (CT, 2007-2008), improved (IT, 2007-2008), straw-amended (WS, 2008-2009), straw-not-amended (NS, 2008-2009), and no N-fertilizer treatments (WS-NN, 2008-2009), respectively, for one rotation-year. The grain yields were determined for CT and IT for three rotation-years (2005-2008) and for WS, NS and WS-NN for one rotation-year (2008-2009). The improved management of irrigation and fertilization reduced the annual N fertilization rate and irrigation amount by 17% and 30%, respectively; increased the maize yield by 7-14%; and significantly decreased the N2O and NO emissions by 7% (p < 0.05) and 29% (p < 0.01), respectively. The incorporation of wheat straw increased the cumulative N2O and NO emissions in the following maize season by 58% (p < 0.01) and 13%, respectively, whereas the effects of maize straw application were not remarkable. The N2O and NO emission factors of applied N were 2.32 +/- 2.32% and 0.42 +/- 1.69% for wheat straw and 0.67 +/- 0.23% and 0.54 +/- 0.15% for chemical N-fertilizers, respectively. Compared to conventional management practices using high application rates of irrigation water and chemical N-fertilizer as well as the field burning of crop straw, the improved management strategy presented here has obvious environmentally positive effects on grain yield and mitigation of N2O and NO emissions.

AB Characterizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global warming potential (GWP) has become a key step in the estimation of atmospheric GHG concentrations and their potential mitigation by cropland management. However, the impacts of organic amendments on GHG, GWP, and yield-scaled GWP on cropland have not been well documented. Here, we investigate four amendment treatments (no amendment, mineral fertilizers, and pig slurry or crop residue combined with mineral fertilizers) during a two-year field experiment in rain-fed wheat-maize cropping systems. The results show that the average annual cumulative methane (CH4) flux ranged from -2.60 to -2.97 kg center dot C center dot ha(-1)while nitrous oxide (N2O) flux ranged from 0.44 to 4.58 kg center dot N center dot ha(-1)across all four treatments. N2O emissions were significantly correlated with soil inorganic nitrogen (i.e., NH4+-N and NO3--N), and soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during both the winter wheat and summer maize seasons. On average, organic amendments combined with mineral fertilizers increased the annual GWP by 26-74% and yield-scaled GWP by 19-71% compared to those under only mineral fertilizers application. This study indicates that the fertilization strategy for Eutric Regosols can shift from only mineral fertilizers to organic amendments combined with mineral fertilizers, which can help mitigate GHG emissions and GWP while maintaining crop yields.

AB Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from croplands are primarily attributed to nitrogen (N) fertilization in agricultural production. However, the interactive effects of various agricultural management practices, climatic conditions, soil properties, and fertilization on non-CO2 GHG emissions (specifically methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)) and gross global warming potential (GGWP) have been scarcely discussed. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of 326 agricultural treatments in China from 76 literature sources to elucidate the relationship between the response ratio (RR) of GGWP (GGWP RR), CH4 (CH4 RR), and N2O emissions (N2O RR) and various explanatory variables using redundancy analysis. Generally, nitrogen fertilizer application increased the N2O and CH4 emissions and GGWP by 120.0%, 32.5%, and 107.9%, respectively. We found that the GGWP RR was closely related to the rate of organic fertilizer application and initial bulk density, while it showed a negative association with the initial total soil nitrogen content. We found that CH4-RR was positively associated with the rate of synthetic fertilizer application, and N2O-RR exhibited a positive association with initial soil organic carbon and annual mean precipitation. Notably, the total fertilizer application rate had the most significant impact on both the GGWP RR and the N2O RR, while mean annual precipitation contributed the most to CH4-RR. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis using a machine learning model suggested that the GGWP RR was more sensitive to synthetic fertilizer than to straw application, and reducing synthetic fertilizer by 30% from the current condition is likely to be the most effective way to alleviate the effect of fertilization on GGWP.

AB The management system of soils and nitrogen application can cause impacts on the N2O emissions produced by the agricultural sector. In the establishment of practices of greenhouse gas mitigation for this sector, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil tillage, with and without N fertilization, on N2O emissions from Oxisols under rainfed maize in the Brazilian Cerrado region. The managements were of monoculture maize under conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), with (1) and without (0) application of N fertilizer (0 and 257 kg N ha(-1)). From November 2014 to October 2015, gas emissions were measured. The soil and climate variables were measured and related to the N2O fluxes. In the N-fertilized treatments, N2O fluxes were higher (P < 0.01), ranging from -21 mu g m(-2) h(-1) to 548 mu g m(-2) h(-1) N2O under conventional tillage and from -21 mu g m(-2) h(-1) to 380 mu g m(-2) h(-1) N2O under no-tillage, compared with -6 to 93 mu g m(-2) h(-1) N2O from systems without N application. There was a combined effect of mineral N and water-filled pore space for most N2O fluxes. The emission factors of N2O during maize cultivation were lower than the standard factor (1%) established by the International Panel of Climate Change. During the plant crop cycle, 30% less N2O was emitted from the N-fertilized no-tillage than from the conventional tillage. For the total cumulative N2O (crop cycle + fallow), the N2O emissions from NT1 and CT1 were not different, but 10x higher than those from the respective crops without N fertilization. To the emissions per unit of grain yield, CT1 and NT1 emitted 769 and 391 mg N2O kg(-1) grain produced, respectively, and NT1 was most efficient in fertilizer-into-product conversion. Under maize cultivation, the soil acted as N2O source, regardless of the management. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental changes significantly alter the structure, diversity and activity of soil microbial communities during spring freezing-thawing period, leading to changes in the soil microbial nitrogen cycle. Changes in N2O fluxes after land use conversion from primary forest to secondary forest, Korean pine plantation and cropland in northeast China have not been quantified. Field experiments were conducted to measure soil N2O fluxes in a primary forest, two secondary forests, a Korean pine plantation, and one maize field in a temperate region in northeast China from 2017-03-06 to 2017-05-28. During the experimental period, the soil was exclusively a nitrogen source for all land uses. We found that N2O emissions ranged from 15.63 to 68.74 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.33 to 2.10 kg ha(-1) during the period. Cumulative (NO)-O-2 emissions from the maize field were significantly higher than that from primary forest, Korean pine plantation, hardwood forest, and Betula platyphylla forest by 262.1% to 536.4%. Compared with other ecosystems in similar studies, the N2O emission rates of all ecosystem types in this study were low during the spring thaw period. Stepwise multiple linear regression indicated that there were significant correlations between N2O emissions and environmental factors (air temperature and soil temperature, soil water content, soil pH, NH4+-N, NO3--N, and soil organic carbon). The results showed that conversion of land use from primary forest to hardwood forest, Korean pine plantation or maize field greatly increased soil N2O emissions during spring freezing-thawing period, and N2O emissions from primary forest were almost the same as those from Betula platyphylla forest.

AB RationaleEnhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions can occur following grassland break-up for renewal or conversion to maize cropping, but knowledge about N2O production pathways and N2O reduction to N-2 is very limited. A promising tool to address this is the combination of mass spectrometric analysis of N2O isotopocules and an enhanced approach for data interpretation.
   MethodsThe isotopocule mapping approach was applied to field data using a N-15(N2O)sp and O-18(N2O) map to simultaneously determine N2O production pathways contribution and N2O reduction for the first time. Based on the isotopic composition of N2O produced and literature values for specific N2O pathways, it was possible to distinguish: (i) heterotrophic bacterial denitrification and/or nitrifier denitrification and (ii) nitrification and/or fungal denitrification and the contribution of N2O reduction.
   ResultsThe isotopic composition of soil-emitted N2O largely resembled the known end-member values for bacterial denitrification. The isotopocule mapping approach indicated different effects of N2O reduction on the isotopic composition of soil-emitted N2O for the two soils under study. Differing N2O production pathways in different seasons were not observed, but management events and soil conditions had a significant impact on pathway contribution and N2O reduction. N2O reduction data were compared with a parallel N-15-labelling experiment.
   ConclusionsThe field application of the isotopocule mapping approach opens up new prospects for studying N2O production and consumption of N2O in soil simultaneously based on mass spectrometric analysis of natural abundance N2O. However, further studies are needed in order to properly validate the isotopocule mapping approach.

AB Agriculture's goal to meet the needs of the increasing world population while reducing the environmental impacts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer use without compromising output has proven to be a challenge. Manure and composts have displayed the potential to increase soil fertility. However, their potential effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions have not been properly understood. Using field-scaled lysimeter experiments, we conducted a one-year study to investigate N2O and CH4 emissions, their combined global warming potential (GWP: N2O + CH4) and yield-scaled GWP in a wheat-maize system. One control and six different organic fertilizer treatments receiving different types but equal amounts of N fertilization were used: synthetic N fertilizer (NPK), 30% pig manure + 70% synthetic N fertilizer (PM30), 50% pig manure + 50% synthetic N fertilizer (PM50), 70% pig manure + 30% synthetic N fertilizer (PM70), 100% pig manure (PM100), 50% cow manure-crop residue compost + 50% synthetic N fertilizer (CMRC), and 50% pig manure-crop residue compost + 50% synthetic N fertilizer (PMRC). Seasonal cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.39 kg N ha(-1) for the PMRC treatment to 0.93 kg N ha(-1) for the NPK treatment. Similar CH4 uptakes were recorded across all treatments, with values ranging from -0.68 kg C ha(-1) for the PM50 treatment to -0.52 kg C ha(-1) for the PM30 treatment. Compared to the NPK treatment, all the organic-amended treatments significantly decreased N2O emission by 32-58% and GWP by 30-61%. However, among the manure-amended treatments, only treatments that consisted of inorganic N with lower or equal proportions of organic manure N treatments were found to reduce N2O emissions while maintaining crop yields at high levels. Moreover, of all the organic-amended treatments, PMRC had the lowest yield-scaled GWP, owing to its ability to significantly reduce N2O emissions while maintaining high crop yields, highlighting it as the most suitable organic fertilization treatment in Sichuan basin wheat-maize systems.

AB Understanding the fate of fertilizer nitrogen (N) in cropping systems is critical to improving agricultural sustainability and minimizing environmental losses. However, efforts to trace fertilizer N are often complicated by manure application in dairy cropping systems. We used a stable isotope tracing approach to investigate how different manure products influence the fate of synthetic fertilizer N in a Midwestern maize silage system by tracking N-15-labled ammonium sulfate into crop biomass, soil organic matter fractions (particulate (POM) and mineral associated (MAOM)), and gaseous loss as nitrous oxide (N2O). Treatments included unprocessed liquid manure (LM), solid manure derived through chemical (CS) or physical (PS) separation, and a no-manure control (NM), combined with fertilizer rates of 90, 180, and 270 kg N ha(-1). Cumulative N2O emissions increased significantly with both manure application and higher fertilizer rates, with PS having lower emissions than LM following fertilizer application. Fertilizer contributed similar proportions to cumulative N2O emissions regardless of manure treatment. Total fertilizer N uptake by crops did not differ among manure treatments, but crops took up more fertilizer N at higher fertilizer application rates. Notably, application of CS and PS enhanced fertilizer N retention in the 0-15 cm soil MAOM pool compared to LM and NM. These findings highlight that although manure type does not significantly affect fertilizer N uptake by crops or fertilizer-derived N2O emissions, solid manures (i.e., CS and PS) can significantly increase fertilizer N retention in soils, offering potential benefits for long-term soil fertility and reduced N losses.

AB Crop straw return can not only affect soil fertility & crop productivity, but also influence nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the optimal straw return methods that ensure high yield and NUE (grain yield/total N uptake, %) with less N2O emissions remain inadequately understood. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment in the North China Plain to investigate the integrated effects of maize straw return on wheat yield, NUE and N2O emissions with five treatments: straw removal (CK), straw mulch (SM), straw mixed evenly into the 0-10 cm soil layer (SR10), straw mixed evenly into the 0-20 cm soil layer (SR20), and straw mixed evenly with the 0-10 cm soil and then the mixture incorporated into the 10-20 cm soil layer (TB). Results showed that maize straw return significantly increased wheat yield compared to straw mulch, with the method of TB achieving the highest yield (10.63 Mg ha(-1)) and NUE (32.97). TB also improved soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N (TN) at the 10-20 cm soil layer, with TN increased by 24.89 % on average compared with SM, promoting soil N uptake by wheat plant and reducing N2O emissions. Conversely, straw mulch or mixed into 0-10 cm soil layer triggered cumulative N2O emissions by 22.33 % and 20.39 % compared to TB, respectively, particularly during the early growing stages, due to enhanced nitrification microbial activity and reduced substrate supply for denitrification. TB reduced yield-scaled N2O emissions by 27.6-29.4 % compared with straw mulch. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that effects of straw return on soil chemical properties (r = 0.37, P < 0.001) and denitrification microbial activity (r = 0.62, P < 0.001) were key drivers of N2O emissions. These findings highlight that stratified incorporation of straw-soil mixtures is a promising strategy to balance wheat yield, NUE, and N2O mitigation in intensive wheat-maize cropping systems in the North China Plain.

AB With a burgeoning world population and growing demand for agricultural products, it will be necessary to strike a judicious balance between maintaining adequate N inputs and minimizing gaseous N losses in farming systems. Our objective in this study was to quantify the effects of soil compaction, N fertilization, and clay content on N2O emission from soil. Soil cropped to maize (Zea mays L.) was compacted by tractor wheel traffic or not compacted for consecutive years, and N fertilizer was applied at 0, 75, 150, and 300 kg N ha(-1) to both compaction treatments. Variability in clay content across the experimental plots allowed us to assess of the effects of texture on N2O response to compaction and N fertilization. Compaction, increasing N fertilization, and their interaction all significantly increased cumulative emissions of N2O during the growing season. There was a significant carryover effect, with higher N2O emissions observed in previously compacted soils in a subsequent year when soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was grown and no compaction or N fertilizer was applied. Nitrous oxide emissions scaled against plant N uptake showed significant positive response to both compaction and N fertilizer. Clay content did not significantly affect N2O emissions, but its role became apparent when the emissions were scaled by N uptake. This scaling amplified the deleterious effects of compaction on gaseous N losses from soil because compaction both increased N2O emissions and decreased yield and plant N uptake. In contrast, increasing N fertilizer increased both and therefore did not have as large an effect on the scaled N2O emissions.

AB Over the past two decades, agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions have increased significantly, further intensifying their impact on global warming. Accurate emission estimates are essential for developing effective N2O-mitigation strategies. However, the high-resolution, dynamic simulations of emissions and comprehensive analysis of their driving mechanisms in China remain unclear. In this study, we constructed a city-level agricultural N2O emission inventory covering 336 cities in China from 2000 to 2022 based on multi-source data and machine learning algorithms. Results demonstrate that China's cropland N2O emissions averaged 390 Gg year(-1) during 2000 and 2022, exhibiting sustained growth until 2016, followed by a 13% reduction driven by the nationwide Fertilizer Reduction Policy implementation. Maize, wheat, and rice are identified as the main sources of cropland N2O emissions. Spatially, higher N2O emission intensities were concentrated in eastern China, and hotspots were identified in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain (5.23 kg ha(-1)) and the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Plain (2.95 kg ha(-1)).

AB Intercropping can improve system productivity, but the effect of intercropping integrated with conservation tillage practices on soil N2O emissions remains unclear at the present stage. A 4-yr field experiment was performed in northwest China to examine soil moisture harvesting, soil nutrient status, and soil N2O emissions of wheat-maize intercropping with stubble residues and films management. We found that intercropping increased crop yields and reduced soil N2O emissions over monocultures. Across the intercropping treatments, NTSMFI (no-tillage with mulching stubbles and re-using residual films) and NTSSFI (no-tillage with standing stubbles and re-using residual films) boosted grain-yields by 13.8-17.1 % and 12.9-15.4 % over CTFI (conventional tillage without returning stubbles and mulching new films). NTSMFI and NTSSFI reduced soil N2O emissions by 18.4-28.7 % and 15.5-24.9 % compared to CTFI, respectively. So, NTSMFI and NTSSFI obtained a higher soil N2O emission efficiency than CTFI. The greater effect on soil N2O emissions reduction was detected in NTSMFI, and decreased by 5.1-5.4 % over NTSSFI. The main reason for NTSMFI to improve grain-yields and reduce soil N2O emissions was to enhance soil moisture harvesting and optimize the soil nutrient status. Compared to CTFI, NTSMFI increased the ratio of transpiration to evaporation by 14.4-32.0 %, improved soil organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations, and soil C:N ratio of 0 to 60 cm soil depth by 14.1 %, 7.1 %, and 6.5 %, respectively. Adopting an environmentally clean strategy exemplified by NTSMFI was recommended as an effective technique for increasing-yields and reducing soil N2O emissions in arid irrigated regions.

AB Utilizing brackish water for irrigation is a key strategy for mitigating water-use conflicts across industries and promoting sustainable agriculture. Understanding the emission patterns and underlying mechanisms of carbon dioxide (CO2) 2 ) and nitrous oxide (N2O) 2 O) under saline conditions is of great practical significance for developing optimized water and salt management strategies that promote water conservation and emission reduction. Therefore, we conducted an indoor incubation experiment using five different salinity gradients (0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 7.0 g/L) to analyze the effects of salinity gradients on soil microorganisms and related enzyme activities and explain the mechanisms of the impact on soil COQ emissions. Additionally, we performed an acetylene inhibition experiment to analyze the effects of salinity on soil NQO production pathways (autotrophic nitrification, heterotrophic nitrification, and denitrification). Our findings indicated that higher salinity levels inhibited the growth of soil bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes and reduced microbial carbon metabolism. This led to decreased activities of key soil enzymes, such as cellulase, sucrase, and alpha-glucosidase, thus suppressing soil CO2 2 emissions. Higher salinity levels were associated with increased soil N2O 2 O emissions. As salinity intensified, the contribution of autotrophic nitrification to N2O 2 O emissions decreased from 89.79 % to 64.95 %, whereas that of denitrification significantly increased from 8.61 % to 33.29 % during the 2nd to 4th days of cultivation. When the irrigation water salinity was lower than 3.0 g/L, its effect on the soil microbial community and enzyme activity was relatively minor and did not cause excessive soil CO2 2 and N2O 2 O emissions. These insights will be instrumental in shaping water and salt management practices that align with sustainable agriculture and greenhouse gas reduction goals.

AB Organic fertilization can preserve soil organic matter (SOM) and is foreseen as an effective strategy to reduce green house gases (GHGs) emissions in agriculture. However, its effectiveness needs to be clarified under specific climate, crop management and soil characteristics. A field experiment was carried out in a Mediterranean drip irrigated maize system to assess the pattern of soil CO2 and N2O fluxes in response to the replacement of a typical bare fallow-maize cycle under urea fertilization (130 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) (CONV) with: (i) bare fallow-maize cycles under two doses of compost (COM1 and COM2, 130 and 260 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively) and (ii) a vetch-maize cycle, with vetch incorporation as green manure (130 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) (GMAN). Along the maize period (MP), reduced daily N2O emissions were detected in organic treated soils compared to CONV, mainly in the first stages of the cultivation, thanks to the slow release of available nitrogen from the organic substrates. Cumulative N2O fluxes (kg N2O-N ha(-1)) in MP scored to 0.24, 0.14, 0.12 and 0.085 for CONV, COM1, COM2 and GMAN, respectively, with significantly lower emissions in GMAN respect to CONV. CO2 fluxes partially reflected the ranking observed for maize yields, with cumulated values (Mg CO2-C ha(-1)) of 2.2, 1.5, 2.1, 2.1 for CONV, COM1, COM2 and GMAN, respectively, and significantly lower in COM1 respect to the other treatments. During the fallow period (FP), compared to CONV (0.77 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) and 0.25 kg N2O -N ha(-1)), enhanced GHG fluxes were detected in COM treatments (about 0.90 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) and 0.37 kg N2O N- ha(-1), as averaged values from COM1 and COM2), likely driven by the slow prolonged mineralization of the added organic matter. GMAN showed comparable CO2 (0.82 Mg CO2-C ha(-1)) and N2O emissions (0.30 kg N2O-N ha(-1)), in consequence of restrained post-harvest residual N coupled with the counteracting effect of vetch uptake. Respect to the total yearly GHG emissions in CONV (about 194 kg CO2 eq ha(-1) y(-1)), the overall results showed commensurate slightly higher GWP in COM treatments (+11% as averaged value from COM1 and COM2). The yield -scaled global warming potential (GWP) resulted 60% higher and nearly doubled for COM2 and COM1 respectively, according to the lower COM yields, markedly dampening at halved compost dose. GMAN appeared the best performing organic treatment, with lower GWP (-27%) and competitive yields respect to CONV. All treatments showed N2O emission factors consistently lower compared with the default IPCC 1% value. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Digestate, a by-product of biogas production, is widely recognized as a promising renewable nitrogen (N) source with high potential to replace synthetic fertilizers. Yet, inefficient digestate use can lead to pollutant N losses as ammonia (NH3) volatilization, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO - 3) leaching. Cover crops (CCs) may reduce some of these losses and recycle the N back into the soil after incorporation, but the effect on the N balance depends on the CC species. In a one--year field study, we tested two application methods (i.e., surface broadcasting, BDC; and shallow injection, INJ) of the liquid fraction of separated co-digested cattle slurry (digestate liquid fraction [DLF]), combined with different winter cover crop (CC) options (i.e., rye, white mustard or bare fallow), as starter fertilizer for maize. Later, side--dressing with urea was required to fulfil maize N--requirements. We tested treatment effects on yield, N--uptake, N--use efficiency parameters, and N--losses in the form of N2O emissions and NO - 3 leaching. CC development and biomass production were strongly affected by their contrasting frost tolerance, with spring--regrowth for rye, while mustard was winter killed. After the CCs, injection of DLF increased N2O emissions significantly compared with BDC (emission factor of 2.69% vs. 1.66%). Nitrous oxide emissions accounted for a small part (11%-13%) of the overall yield-scaled N losses (0.46-0.97 kg N Mg grain-1). The adoption of CCs reduced fall NO - 3 leaching, being 51% and 64% lower for mustard and rye than under bare soil. In addition, rye reduced NO - 3 leaching during spring and summer after termination by promoting N immobilization, thus leading to -57% lower annual leaching losses compared with mustard. DLF application method modified N-loss pathways, but not the cumulative yield-scaled N losses. Overall, these insights contribute to inform an evidence-based design of cropping systems in which nutrients are recycled more efficiently.

AB Plastic-shed vegetable cultivation is characterized by high nitrogen (N) application rates, frequent irrigation and multiple cropping, probably leading to different soil N transformation rates compared to open-field cultivation. However, how continuous cultivation of vegetables under plastic sheds affects soil N transformation rates and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remains unclear. Here, a 15N-tracing experiment in combination with the qPCR technique was used to investigate the effects of conversion from conventional open-field cultivation to plastic-shed vegetable cultivation, as well as the age of this shift, on soil gross N transformation rates, N2O emission pathways and associated microbial abundances. Five typical fields, including a wheat-maize rotation system field and four adjacent plastic-shed vegetable fields under cultivation for 2, 5, 12 and 20 years, were selected. Soil gross N mineralization rates increased significantly after two years after conversion from a wheat-maize rotation system to a plastic-shed vegetable system, and then decreased with an increase in plan-tation age, which could be attributed to decreased soil total phosphorus availability. Long-term vegetable plantation under plastic-shed decreased soil gross autotrophic nitrification rates significantly by decreasing ammonia-oxidizing bacteria abundance probably due to decreasing soil pH. Such decreased rates of autotrophic nitrification further led to decreased N2O emissions under plastic-shed cultivation. Under long-term plastic-shed cultivation (> 2 years), negligible gross nitrate-N (NO3--N) immobilization rates were observed due to the pref-erential use of ammonium-N by soil microbes, which was probably responsible for rapid NO3--N accumulation in soils. Overall, these results could be of help to elucidate the mechanisms of soil N2O emission and NO3--N accumulation in plastic-shed vegetable fields.

AB Soil salinization may negatively affect microbial processes related to carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. A short-term laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of soil electrical conductivity (EC) and moisture content on CO2 and N2O emissions from sulfate-based natural saline soils. Three separate 100-m long transects were established along the salinity gradient on a salt-affected agricultural field at Mooreton, North Dakota, USA. Surface soils were collected from four equally spaced sampling positions within each transect, at the depths of 0-15 and 15-30 cm. In the laboratory, artificial soil cores were formed combining soils from both the depths in each transect, and incubated at 60% and 90% water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 25 degrees C. The measured depth-weighted EC of the saturated paste extract (ECe). across the sampling positions ranged from 0.43 to 4.65 dS m(-1). Potential nitrogen (N) mineralization rate and CO2 emissions decreased with increasing soil ECe, but the relative decline in soil CO2 emissions with increasing ECe was smaller at 60% WFPS than at 90% WFPS. At 60% WFPS, soil N2O emissions decreased from 133 mu g N2O-N kg(-1) soil at ECe < 0.50 dS m(-1) to 72 ug N2O-N kg(-1) soil at ECe = 4.65 dS m(-1). In contrast, at 90% WFPS, soil N2O emissions increased from 262 mu g N2O-N kg(-1) soil at ECe = 0.81 dS m(-1) to 849 sg N2O-N kg(-1) soil at ECe = 4.65 dS m(-1), suggesting that N2O emissions were linked to both soil ECe and moisture content. Therefore, spatial variability in soil ECe and pattern of rainfall over the season need to be considered when up-scaling N2O and CO2 emissions from field to landscape scales.

AB Crop residues may serve as a significant source of soil emissions of N2O and other trace gases. According to the emission factors (EFs) set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), N2O emission is proportional to the amount of N added by residues to the soil. However, the effects of crop residues on the source and sink strength of agroecosystems for trace gases are regulated by their properties, such as the C and N content; C/N ratio; lignin, cellulose, and soluble fractions; and residue humidity. In the present study, an automated dynamic chamber method was used in combination with soil mesocosms to simultaneously measure the effects of nine different crop residues (oilseed rape, winter wheat, field pea, maize, potato, mustard, red clover, sugar beet, and iyegrass) on soil respiration (CO2) and reactive N fluxes (N2O, NO, and NH3 at a high temporal resolution. Specifically, crop residues were incorporated in the 0-4 cm topsoil layer and incubated for 60 days at a constant temperature (15 degrees C) and water-filled pore space (60% WFPS). Residue incorporation immediately and sharply increased soil N2O and CO2 emissions, but these were short-lived and returned to background levels within respectively 10 and 30 days. The magnitude of increase in soil NO flux following residue incorporation was lower than that in CO2 and N2O fluxes, with peak emissions observed around day 20. Overall, the N content or C/N ratio of the applied residue could not sufficiently explain the variation in soil N2O and NO emissions. The range of the calculated N2O EFs over a 60-day period was -0.17 to +45, being wider than that proposed by the IPCC -0.01 to +1.1). Therefore, the residue maturity stage may be used as a simple proxy to estimate the N2O + NO emissions from incorporated residue. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Agricultural soils often receive annual applications of manure for long periods. Our objective was to quantify the effects of 19 consecutive years of pig (Sus scrofa) slurry (PS) application to a loamy soil (loamy, mixed, frigid Aeric Haplaquept) on N2O emissions. Soil surface N2O fluxes (F-N2O) were measured 36 times in 1 yr. Nitrous oxide concentration profiles, soil NH4+- and NO3--N contents, denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA), and denitrification rate (DR) in soil were also determined to explain the variation in F-N2O. Long-term (19 Jr) treatments on continuous silage maize (Zea mays L.) were 60 (PS60) and 120 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (PS120) of pig slurry and a control receiving mineral fertilizer at a dose of 150 kg ha(-1) each of N, P2O5, and K2O. Denitrifying enzyme activity, soil N2O concentrations, and F-N2O (<25 ng m(-2) s(-1)) were low in the control plots receiving mineral fertilizer. Annual applications of PS to the soil for 18 Jr had positive residual effects on the DEA compared with the long-term fertilized control plots. Following PS application, there was a strong and rapid increase of F-N2O (np to 350 ng m(-2) s(-1)) on manured plots. The PS-induced F-N2O increased with increasing quantity of PS, probably as the result of a greater availability of NO3--N for denitrification. The effects of PS on F-N2O were mostly limited to the 30 d following application, with low nuxes (<10 ng m(-2) s(-1)) during the rest of the measurement period. Total N2O-N emissions represented 0.62, 1.23, and 1.65% of total N applied in control, PS60, and PS120 plots, respectively. These emission factors for the PS plots agreed with values previously suggested for N-fertilized soils (1.25%).

AB One way of reducing the emissions of fossil fuel-derived carbon dioxide (CO2) is to replace fossil fuels with biofuels produced from agricultural biomasses or residuals. However, cultivation of soils results in emission of other greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially nitrous oxide (N2O). Previous studies on biofuel production systems showed that emissions of N2O may counterbalance a substantial part of the global warming reduction, which is achieved by fossil fuel displacement. In this study, we related measured field emissions of N2O to the reduction in fossil fuel-derived CO2, which was obtained when agricultural biomasses were used for biofuel production. The analysis included five organically managed feedstocks (viz. dried straw of sole cropped rye, sole cropped vetch and intercropped ryevetch, as well as fresh grassclover and whole crop maize) and three scenarios for conversion of biomass into biofuel. The scenarios were (i) bioethanol, (ii) biogas and (iii) coproduction of bioethanol and biogas. In the last scenario, the biomass was first used for bioethanol fermentation and subsequently the effluent from this process was utilized for biogas production. The net GHG reduction was calculated as the avoided fossil fuel-derived CO2, where the N2O emission was subtracted. This value did not account for fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions from farm machinery and during conversion processes that turn biomass into biofuel. The greatest net GHG reduction, corresponding to 700800 g CO2 m(-2), was obtained by biogas production or coproduction of bioethanol and biogas on either fresh grassclover or whole crop maize. In contrast, biofuel production based on lignocellulosic crop residues (i.e. rye and vetch straw) provided considerably lower net GHG reductions (=215 g CO2 m(-2)), and even negative numbers sometimes. No GHG benefit was achieved by fertilizing the maize crop because the extra crop yield, and thereby increased biofuel production, was offset by enhanced N2O emissions.

AB A growing bioeconomy demands high, but sustainable production of biomass. In contrast to annual crops, perennial crops may combine high biomass yields with low nitrogen (N) leaching losses despite intensive management. However, there is an important trade-off between N fertilization to increase biomass production and the associated nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions when estimated with the IPCC default emission factor (EF) of 1% of applied N. Actual N2O emissions may vary with crop species and site conditions, and a field experiment was therefore conducted to determine N2O emissions and biomass yields from selected perennial crops. Three perennial crops were established five years prior to this study, including festulolium (x Festulolium braunii) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), both receiving 425 kg N ha(-1) in NPK fertilizer with 60% ammonium-N and 40% nitrate-N, and grass-clover (Lolium perenne-Trifolium pretense) receiving PK fertilizer only. Maize (Zea mays) receiving 140 kg N ha(-1) in NPK was included as a reference annual crop; all treatments had unfertilized subplots. The total biomass yields of fertilized maize (14.3 Mg DM ha(-1)), festulolium (15.3 Mg DM ha(-1)) and tall fescue (16.2 Mg DM ha(-1)) were similar, and higher than grass-clover yield (8.4 Mg DM ha(-1)). There were three cuts in perennial crops, and peak emissions of N2O occurred after cutting and fertilization. Unexpectedly, PK fertilization increased N2O emissions by 89% compared to unfertilized grass-clover. A mixed-effect model examining drivers of N2O emissions after each fertilization indicated that temperature and nitrate were more important for N2O emissions than soil wetness, whether this was expressed as water-filled pore space or relative gas diffusivity, D-p/D-0. The overall highest emissions of N2O, which occurred in festulolium and tall fescue after the 1st cut and 2nd fertilization, coincided with rainfall after a dry period. Measurements of soil respiration indicated that these high N2O emissions were triggered by a release of labile carbon after the rapid wetting, and hence that denitrification of nitrate in the fertilizer applied was a significant source. Fertilization increased N2O emissions two- to three-fold compared to treatments without fertilization, but the annual emission factors for fertilizer N were consistently below the default IPCC emission factor of 1% with 0.23 +/- 0.04, 0.32 +/- 0.03 and 0.54 +/- 0.13% for, respectively, festulolium, tall fescue and maize. Hence, this study suggests that intensively managed perennial crops can be used for biomass production on sandy loam soil without excessive N2O emissions compared to annual crops.

AB Addition of organic material, such as plant litter, can strongly alter C and N turnover in soils and promote CO2 and N2O formation. This study aimed to elucidate the role of C availability on N turnover processes leading to N2O formation under moderately dry conditions. We measured CO2, NO, and N2O fluxes and contributing processes from an arable and a grassland soil with four different treatments: 50% water-filled pore space (WFPS), 50% WFPS + Maize litter, 60% WFPS, 60% WFPS + Maize litter. CO2 fluxes were partitioned into SOM- and litter-derived, and N2O-forming processes were esti-mated applying a Bayesian mixing and fractionation model to infer source contributions and N2O reduction rates. Further, we quantified bacterial and fungal population size, as well as genes involved in nitrification and denitrification at the end of the experiment. N2O flux dynamics and contributing processes strongly differed between the C-limited arable soil and the C-rich grassland soil. In the arable soil, bacterial denitrification was consistently the main source of N2O and strongly increased with addition of maize litter. In contrast, nitrification accounted for 51% of N2O formation in the grassland soil without litter, while litter addition promoted fungal denitrification. We found higher N2O emissions with higher total and SOM-derived CO2 emissions confirming that availability of organic C from SOM and litter are important controls of N2O losses. However, neither soil organic C content, nor litter addition, nor soil moisture alone were appropriate to predict the main N2O-forming process. Therefore, our study emphasizes the need to disentangle and quantify N2O-forming processes to develop successful mitigation strategies

AB Agriculture is one of the major sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) whose atmospheric concentrations are estimated to increase with efforts to increase food production through increasing nitrogen (N) inputs. The objective of this study was to quantify N2O emissions from maize (Zea mays L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields amended with inorganic, organic N and a combination of both sources (integrated management), in tropical (Zimbabwe) and temperate (China) climatic conditions. In Zimbabwe N2O emissions were measured from maize plots, while in China emissions were measured from maize and winter wheat plots. In Zimbabwe the treatments were; (i) Control, (ii) 60 kg N ha(-1) ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), (iii) 120 kg N ha(-1) NH4NO3, (iv) 60 kg ha(-1) cattle (Bos primigenius) manure-N, plus 60 kg N ha(-1) NH4NO3, (v) 60 kg N ha(-1) cattle manure-N, and (vi) 120 kg N ha(-1) cattle manure-N. In China, treatments were; (i) Control, (ii) 300 kg N ha(-1) Urea, (iii) 92 kg N ha(-1) Urea plus 65 kg ha(-1) chicken (Gallus domesticus) manure-N, (iv) 100 kg N ha(-1) Urea and (v) 100 kg N ha(-1) control release Urea. Our results showed that under both temperate and tropical conditions, integrated nutrient management resulted in lower N2O emissions compared to inorganic fertilizers which had higher total and yield-scale N2O emissions. We conclude that by combining organic and inorganic N sources, smallholder farmers in both China and Zimbabwe, and other countries with similar climatic conditions, can mitigate agricultural emissions without compromising productivity.

AB Manure application is effective in promoting soil carbon sequestration, but its impact on N2O emission is not well understood. A field experiment was conducted in a maize-cultivated black soil in Northeast China with six treatments: inorganic fertilizer (NPK), 75% inorganic fertilizer N plus 25% pig (PM1) or chicken (CM1) manure N, 50% inorganic fertilizer N plus 50% pig (PM2) or chicken (CM2) manure N, and no N fertilizer (CK). Annual N2O emission significantly increased from 0.34kgNha(-1) for CK to 0.86kgNha(-1) for NPK and further to 1.65, 1.02, 1.17, and 0.93kgNha(-1) for PM1, CM1, PM2, and CM2, respectively. A N-15 tracing study showed that 71-79% of total N2O was related to nitrification at 30-70% water-filled pore space (WFPS), and heterotrophic nitrification contributed 49% and 25% to total N2O at 30% and 70% WFPS, respectively. In an incubation, N2O emission was only stimulated when nitrate and glucose were applied together at 60% WFPS, indicating that denitrification was carbon limited. PM had a stronger effect on denitrification than CM due to higher decomposability, and the lower N2O emission at higher manure application rate was associated with decreased mineral N supply. After compiling a worldwide database and establishing an empirical model that related N2O emissions (kgNha(-1)) to precipitation (P-r, m) and fertilizer N application rate (N-r, kg N ha(-1)) (N2O = 1.533P(r) + 0.0238P(r)N(r)), annual N2O emission from global-cultivated black soil applied with inorganic fertilizer N was estimated as 347 Gg N. Our results suggested that N2O emission from cultivated black soils in China was low primarily due to low precipitation and labile organic carbon availability, and would be stimulated by manure application; thus, increased N2O emission should be taken into consideration as applying manure increases soil organic carbon sequestration.

AB A long-term field experiment was established to determine the influence of mineral fertilizer and organic manure on soil fertility. A tract of red soil (Ferralic Cambisol) in Qiyang Red Soil Experimental Station (Qiyang County, Hunan Province, China) was fertilized beginning in 1990 and N2O and CO, were examined during the maize and wheat growth season of 2007-2008. The study involved five treatments: organic manure (NPKM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NP (NP), fertilizer NK (NK), and control (CK). Manured soils had higher crop biomass, organic C, and pH than soils receiving the various mineralized fertilizers indicating that long-term application of manures could efficiently prevent red soil acidification and increase crop productivity. The application of manures and fertilizers at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) obviously increased N2O and CO2 emissions from 0.58 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 10 565 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the CK treatment soil to 3.01 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 28 663 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the NPKM treatment. There were also obvious different effects on N2O and CO, emissions between applying fertilizer and manure. More N2O and CO2 released during the 184-d maize growing season than the 125-d wheat growth season in the manure fertilized soils but not in mineral fertilizer treatments. N2O emission was significantly affected by soil moisture only during the wheat growing season, and CO, emission was affected by soil temperature only in CK and NP treatment during the wheat and maize growing season. In sum, this study indicates the application of organic manure may be a preferred strategy for maintaining red soil productivity, but may result in greater N2O and CO2 emissions than treatments only with mineral fertilizer.

AB Calculated N2O emission factors (EFs) of applied nitrogen (N) fertilizer are currently based upon a single, universal value advocated by the IPCC (Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change) even though EFs are thought to vary with climate and soil types. Here, we compiled and analyzed 151 N2O EF values from agricultural fields across China. The EF of synthetic N applied to these croplands was 0.60%, on average, but differed significantly among six climatic zones across the country, with the highest EF found in the north subtropical zone for upland fields (0.93%) and the lowest in the middle subtropical zone for paddy fields (0.20%). Precipitation and soil pH, which showed non-linear relationships with EF, are among the factors governing it, explaining 7.0% and 8.0% of the regional variation in EFs, respectively. Annual precipitation was the key factor regulating N2O emissions from synthetic N fertilizers. Among crop types, legume crops had the highest EFs, which were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those of cereals. Total soil N2O emissions from fertilized croplands with maize, rice, wheat, and vegetables in China, calculated using the climatic zone (regional) EFs, were estimated to be 239 Gg N yr(-1) with an uncertainty of 21%. Importantly, this value was substantially (33%) lower than that (357 Gg N yr(-1)) derived from the IPCC default EF but close to the 253 Gg N yr(-1) estimated using crop-specific EFs. N2O emissions from applied synthetic N fertilizer accounted for 66.5% of the total annual N2O emissions from China's maize, rice, wheat and vegetable fields. Taken together, our study's results strongly suggest that regional EFs should be included for accurate N2O inventories from croplands across China. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed at evaluating soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from integrated farming systems. Soil N2O and CH4 fluxes were assessed in a subtropical Cambisol in southern Brazil, using manual static chambers, over two years, in five farming systems (cropland, livestock, integrated crop-livestock, integrated livestock-forestry, and integrated crop-livestock-forestry). The study was conducted in four growing seasons: summer-1, winter-1, summer-2, winter-2. Integrated farming systems had lower soil N2O emissions than livestock. The observed reduction was possibly due to lower water-filled pore space (WFPS) in soils under integrated systems (average 59.5-64.7%, vs 70.4% in livestock) as indicated by correlation (r = 0.74). Cropland, including cover-crops and maize, also had lower N2O emission (by 40%) relative to livestock, of levels similar to those observed in integrated systems. Methane was consumed in soil, but it was not affected by farming systems, and offset only similar to 1.4% of the N2O emissions. In the rainiest season of summer-2, the soil had the highest WFPS (on average 71.4%) and thus the highest N2O emission (on average 9.79 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1)) and the lowest CH4 consumption (on average - 0.40 kg CH4-C ha(-1) season(-1)); while the opposite trend occurred in the driest season of winter-2 (on average 57.3% WFPS; 0.64 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1) and -0.90 kg CH4-C ha(-1) season(-1)). Integrated farming systems including crop-livestock, livestock-forestry and crop-livestock-forestry reduced soil N2O emissions relative to sole livestock by 27-40%, but did not affect CH4 emissions. Seasonal variations of precipitation, and therefore WFPS were driving factors of the N2O and CH4 emissions. Overall, integrated farming systems show the potential to mitigate soil N2O emission compared to livestock system.

AB Straw retention has been adopted worldwide to increase crop production and it has also been shown to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from agricultural soils. However, it is difficult to accurately predict N2O emission under different straw retention methods without a long-term experiment. This study used data from the maize planting season in the Griffith region, Australia, to test whether the denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model can simulate the rate, annual amount, and pattern of N2O emission. The sensitivity to several important factors which may affect N2O emission was analyzed. The research investigated whether the DNDC model can be used to determine the best straw retention method to reduce N2O emission. The results were as follows: (1) The DNDC model could be used to simulate soil and climate conditions of Griffith region. The correlation coefficients of simulated and observed water-filled pore space and temperature were 0.9532 (n = 126) and 0.9781 (n = 365), respectively; (2) the simulation values of 300N-burn and 300N-incorporate for a year were 12.96 and 8.08 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and the emission factors were 3.31 and 1.77, respectively; (3) the emission reduction effect and mineralized N accumulation of straw incorporation were better compared to burnt straw, using the DNDC model. The correlation coefficients of simulated and observed daily values of 300N-burn and 300N-incorporate were 0.8743 and 0.8023, respectively; (4) the amount and frequency of nitrogen fertilizer application, irrigation frequency, and soil texture could affect N2O emission, whereas soil pH and soil bulk density did not.

AB Groundwater irrigation of cropland is expanding worldwide with poorly known implications for climate change. This study compares experimental measurements of the net global warming impact of a rainfed versus a groundwater-irrigated corn (maize)-soybean-wheat, no-till cropping system in the Midwest US, the region that produces the majority of U.S. corn and soybean. Irrigation significantly increased soil organic carbon (C) storage in the upper 25 cm, but not by enough to make up for the CO2-equivalent (CO(2)e) costs of fossil fuel power, soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), and degassing of supersaturated CO2 and N2O from the groundwater. A rainfed reference system had a net mitigating effect of -13.9 (+/- 31) g CO(2)e m(-2) year(-1), but with irrigation at an average rate for the region, the irrigated system contributed to global warming with net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 27.1 (+/- 32) g CO(2)e m(-2) year(-1). Compared to the rainfed system, the irrigated system had 45% more GHG emissions and 7% more C sequestration. The irrigation-associated increase in soil N2O and fossil fuel emissions contributed 18% and 9%, respectively, to the system's total emissions in an average irrigation year. Groundwater degassing of CO2 and N2O are missing components of previous assessments of the GHG cost of groundwater irrigation; together they were 4% of the irrigated system's total emissions. The irrigated system's net impact normalized by crop yield (GHG intensity) was +0.04 (+/- 0.006) kg CO(2)e kg(-1) yield, close to that of the rainfed system, which was -0.03 (+/- 0.002) kg CO(2)e kg(-1) yield. Thus, the increased crop yield resulting from irrigation can ameliorate overall GHG emissions if intensification by irrigation prevents land conversion emissions elsewhere, although the expansion of irrigation risks depletion of local water resources.

AB The soil nitrogen (N) dynamics of an irrigated maize system in which stubble retention and stubble burned treatments were superimposed over treatments of varying N fertiliser rate were studied. The field site was near Whitton, New South Wales, Australia, and the work described here is part a life cycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from maize project. The objective of this part of the work was to quantify the fate of fertiliser N applied at the site. Field measurements of denitrification, mineral N content and recovery of N-15-labelled urea from microplots with and without ammonium thiosulfate were complimented with laboratory studies of denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux. Significantly (P < 0.05) more fertiliser N was recovered in the grain from the stubble incorporated treatment than the stubble burned treatment and there was greater recovery of fertiliser N in the soil at the end of the experiment in the stubble burned treatment. This may indicate that fertiliser N applied to the stubble burned system may be more exposed to soil-N transformations. The reason for the difference in uptake and soil residual is not clear but may be related to soil structure differences leading to less plant accessibility of N in the burned treatment. This difference may lead to more nitrous oxide emission from soil in the stubble burned treatments. Short-term (1 h) static chamber measurements in the field found a strong N-rate dependence of N2O emission rate for fertiliser rates between 0 and 300 kg N/ha. Inclusion of ammonium thiosulfate in the fertiliser formulation did not appear to have a significant impact on fertiliser N recovery.

AB Conversion of agricultural systems from conventional to no tillage practices usually increases soil carbon storage. However, adoption of no tillage may increase emissions of N2O, a very potent greenhouse gas. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of tillage (mouldboard plough [MP] and no-tillage [NT]) and three mineral N application rates (0,80 and 160 kg N ha(-1)) on annual and biennial (2004-2005) N2O fluxes. The experiment was organized using a split-plot design using tillage as the main plots and fertilizer rates as the sub-plot. The site was an artificially drained and therefore well structured humic gleysol near Montreal QC, on a maize (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation. Emissions (April-November) ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Throughout both years tillage had no effect (P > 0.05) on N2O emissions. During 2004, under maize cultivation, N2O emissions increased with the N fertilization rate (P < 0.001). Between 0.9 and 1.3% of applied fertilizer N was lost as N2O-N, similar to the IPCC estimate of 1%. There was also no significant interaction between tillage and N fertilization rate on N2O emissions during either year (P = 0.79). During the second year, under soybean cultivation, no N fertilizer was applied. As N2O emissions from the different fertilizer treatments were similar (P = 0.99), we concluded that there was no carry-over effect of the fertilization applied to maize in the previous year. Yield-based N2O emissions were similar between the different tillage types (P = 0.63 and 0.12 for 2004 and 2005, respectively) and fertilization rates (P = 0.30 and 0.84 for 2004 and 2005, respectively) and ranged from 17.0 to 22.7 g N2O-N kg(-1) N export in 2004 and 6.6 to 12.8 g N2O-N kg(-1) N export in 2005. Overall our results indicate that for this well-drained soil: (i) N fertilizer applications increased N2O emissions, supporting the use of IPCC-type emission factors; and (ii) soil tillage and the tillage-fertilization interaction had no measurable effect, consistent with previous reports that tillage of well-aerated agricultural soils has little effect on N2O emissions.

AB Aim of the study: Alfalfa is one the most important forage legume crop worldwide but little information is available regarding to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) under Mediterranean sprinkler-irrigated conditions.
   Area of study: Middle Ebro valley, Spain
   Materials and methods: The GHG emissions during two alfalfa growing periods (4th and 5th stands) were evaluated using both the static method chambers and two automatic chambers coupled with a photoacoustic equipment that measured short-term gas emissions.
   Main results: Year-average CH4 fluxes were -0.71 g C ha(-1) day(-1), generally no significantly different from zero. Year-average N2O flux was 3.96 g N ha(-1) day(-1) with higher fluxes associated to some specific large rainfall or irrigation events. Average cumulative emissions of 865 g N ha(-1) year(-1) were found. We found short-term peaks of N2O (up to 160 g N ha(-1) day(-1)) associated with high values of soil water filled pore space (WFPS) that can go unnoticed using the static chamber procedure. In spite of the higher soil NO3- concentration in the alfalfa-precedent field compared to the maize-precedent field, no significant differences in cumulative N2O emissions were observed in the two-month period after alfalfa or maize residues incorporation.
   Research highlights: Low GHG emissions were found in an irrigated alfalfa crop compared to N-fertilized crops but a deeper knowledge of the limiting factors of denitrification observed during some anoxic events (WFPS>90%) is necessary to properly quantify N2O emissions in irrigated alfalfa.

AB Surface drip fertigation has demonstrated promising results regarding the mitigation of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The use of subsurface irrigation may offer the possibility of reducing these emissions further due to the modification of the soil moisture profile and N allocation, both of which affect the biochemical processes leading to N2O fluxes. However, the mitigation potential of subsurface irrigation combined with different mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizers (ammonium or nitrate-based, use of nitrification inhibitors) still needs to be evaluated. To respond to this need, a 2-year field experiment was set up in central Spain to test two different drip-fertigation systems (surface and subsurface at 30 cm depth) and four N fertilization treatments (control, calcium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate with or without the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate, DMPP) in an irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) crop. Nitrous oxide emissions, mineral N concentrations (ammonium, NH4+, and nitrate, NO3-), and abundance of key N genes involved in nitrification and denitrification processes were measured in two soil layers (0-20 and 20-40 cm). Regardless of the irrigation system, ammonium sulfate gave the highest cumulative N2O losses in both campaigns, while calcium nitrate and the use of DMPP were the most effective strategies to abate N2O fluxes in the first and second years, respectively. Differences between irrigation systems were not statistically significant for cumulative N2O emissions, despite the clear effect on topsoil mineral N (higher NH4+ and NO3- concentrations in surface and subsurface drip, respectively). Nitrous oxide emissions were positively correlated with soil NH4+ concentrations. Gene abundances were not a trustworthy predictor of N2O losses in the 1st year, although a clear inhibitory effect of fertilization on microbial communities (i.e., ammonia oxidizers, nitrite reducers, and N2O reducers) was observed during this campaign. During the second year, nitrifying and denitrifying genes were affected by irrigation (with higher abundances in the 20-40 cm layer in subsurface than in surface drip) and by the addition of DMPP (which had a detrimental effect on gene abundances in both irrigation systems that disappeared after the fertigation period). In conclusion, the use of DMPP or calcium nitrate instead of ammonium sulfate may enhance the chances for an additional mitigation in both surface and subsurface irrigation systems.

AB There is an increasing interest of the soil gas-phase dynamics due to the elevated greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. While soil surface flux is widely studied, there are relatively few studies investigating the concentration and transport of greenhouse gases within the soil profile. The object of our study was to investigate these processes by using undisturbed soil monoliths. Since gas sampling is difficult especially from waterlogged or wet soils, we have developed a silicone-tube soil air sampler for soil monoliths. Six undisturbed soil monoliths have been prepared from the nearby long-term experimental field of Keszthely University. Silicone tubes have been inserted across the soil columns at three depths and the soil air composition was measured during a growth season of seeded maize. We found that the gases of interest (CO2 and N2O) could easily get through the wall of silicone tube while keeping out the water. The first experiment using silicone tubes showed reproducible results. The differences in vertical distribution of these gases were significant in case of CO2 while N2O distribution was quite even. CO2 and N2O concentrations of soil air have changed in time as maize root developed and the soil moisture changed by rainfall.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from Australian grain cropping systems are highly variable due to the large variations in soil and climate conditions and management practices under which crops are grown. Agricultural soils contribute 55% of national N2O emissions, and therefore mitigation of these emissions is important. In the present study, we explored N2O emissions, yield and emissions intensity in a range of management practices in grain crops across eastern Australia with the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). The model was initially evaluated against experiments conducted at six field sites across major grain-growing regions in eastern Australia. Measured yields for all crops used in the experiments (wheat, barley, sorghum, maize, cotton, canola and chickpea) and seasonal N2O emissions were satisfactorily predicted with R-2 = 0.93 and R-2 = 0.91 respectively. As expected, N2O emissions and emissions intensity increased with increasing nitrogen (N) fertiliser input, whereas crop yields increased until a yield plateau was reached at a site-and crop-specific N rate. The mitigation potential of splitting N fertiliser application depended on the climate conditions and was found to be relevant only in the southern grain-growing region, where most rainfall occurs during the cropping season. Growing grain legumes in rotation with cereal crops has great potential to reduce mineral N fertiliser requirements and so N2O emissions. In general, N management strategies that maximise yields and increase N use efficiency showed the greatest promise for N2O mitigation.

AB High nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions may occur during the non-rice growing season of Chinese rice-upland crop rotation systems. However, our understanding of N2O emission during this season is poor due to a scarcity of available field N2O measurements.
   Using the static manual chamber-GC technique, seasonal N2O emissions during the non-rice growing season were simultaneously measured at two adjacent rice-wheat and rice-rapeseed fields in southwest China for three consecutive annual rotation cycles (May 2005 to May 2008).
   Compared to the control, N fertilizer applications significantly enhanced soil N2O emissions from both wheat and rapeseed systems. Seasonal cumulative N2O fluxes from wheat systems were on average 2.6 kg N ha(-1) for the recommended practice (RP [150 kg N ha(-1)]) and 5.0 kg N ha(-1) for the conventional practice (CP [250 kg N ha(-1)]). Lower N2O emissions were observed from the adjacent rapeseed systems. Average cumulative seasonal N2O fluxes from rapeseed were 1.5 and 2.2 kg N ha(-1) for the RP and CP treatments, respectively. The first 3 weeks after N fertilization were the "hot moment" of N2O emissions for both the wheat and rapeseed systems. The lowest yield-scaled N2O fluxes for wheat were obtained at the RP treatment (mean: 0.81 kg N Mg-1) while for rapeseed the CP treatment produced the lowest yield-scaled fluxes (mean: 0.79 kg N Mg-1). On average, the direct N2O emission factors (EFd) for the wheat system (1.76 %) were over two times higher than for the rapeseed system (0.73 %).
   Intercropping of rapeseed tends to result in lower N2O emissions than wheat for rice-upland crop rotation systems of southwest China, indicating that either the N fertilization or the cropping system need to be considered not only for improving the estimate of regional and/or national N2O fluxes but also for proposing the climate-smart agricultural management practice to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils.

AB Annual nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from high-altitude alpine meadow grasslands have not been effectively characterized because of the scarcity of whole-year measurements. The authors performed a year-round measurement of N2O fluxes from three conventionally grazed alpine meadows that represent the typical meadow landscape in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The results showed that annual N2O emissions averaged 0.123 +/- 0.053 (2SD, i.e., the double standard deviation indicating the 95% confidence interval) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) across the three meadow sites. N2O flux pulses during the spring freezing-thawing period (FTP) were observed at only one site, indicating a large spatial variability in association with soil moisture differences. Approximately 34-57% (mean: 46%) of the annual N2O emissions occurred in the non-growing season, highlighting the substantial importance of accurate flux observations during this period. The simultaneous observations showed conservative, marginal nitric oxide (NO) fluxes of 0.058 +/- 0.032 (2SD) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The N2O fluxes across the three field sites correlated negatively with the soil nitrate concentrations during the entire year-round period (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a significant joint regulatory effect of topsoil temperature and moisture on the N2O and NO fluxes was observed during the relatively warm periods. Based on the results of the present and previous studies, a simple extrapolation roughly estimated the annual total N2O emission from Chinese grasslands to be 73 +/- 15 (2SD) Gg N yr(-1) (1 Gg = 10(9) g). A linear dependence of the annual N2O fluxes on the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was also found. This result may provide a simple approach for estimating the N2O emission inventories of frigid alpine or temperate grasslands that are ungrazed either in the summer or year round. However, further confirmation of this relationship with a wider ANPP range is still needed in the future studies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Improving nitrogen (N) efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are dual challenges of the agricultural sector in the North China Plain (NCP). Most relevant studies conducted in the NCP lasted only 1-2 years without sufficiently addressing the temporal variations of weather conditions and farming practices over different seasons. Thus, a 4-year (2008-2012) field experiment was conducted for a wheat-maize cropping system in a typical intensive agricultural region of the NCP. The three N application rates were (a) control without N application (CK); (b) farmers' conventional N fertilization (CON), i.e., 600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); and (c) optimized N fertilization (OPT), i.e., 420 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), N uptake and crop production were measured. Compared with CON, the annual cumulative N2O emissions from OPT decreased by 40.9%, 7.2%, and 223% during the 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 rotation years, respectively. Basal N fertilization in the wheat season was the critical period for N2O mitigation, although the maize season contributed 51%-89% of the annual N2O emission. CH4 uptake (CO2-equivalent) via soil accounted for 60%-96% of N2O in CK treatment and 4%-48% in fertilization treatments, indicating that CH4 should be considered in the overall GHG emissions from crop production. Compared with CON, OPT significantly improved N efficiency by 46%-52% for wheat and maize and maintained a similar or higher crop yield. Improvements in N efficiency should focus on the maize season. Water saving practices exhibited high potential to reduce indirect GHG emissions for the entire life cycle of crop production. Compared with CON, OPT significantly reduced the GHG intensity, particularly in the wheat season. Future long-term field experiments are required to account for considerable variations in GHG emissions and crop production under field conditions in the NCP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cover crops in rotation or intercropped with annual crops are important strategies to increase C and N input in agricultural soils. However, these practices may also enhance soil N2O emissions. The effect on N2O emissions may be dependent upon the biochemical composition of cover crop residues. A 47-d incubation study was conducted to determine soil N2O emissions following the addition of residues from three summer legume species [pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.), lablab bean (Lablab purpureus)], one winter legume [vetch (Vicia sativa L.)], one winter monocotyledon [black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.)], and maize (Zea mays L.) under two water-filled pore space levels (40 and 70% WFPS). Short-term peaks of N2O fluxes were observed after the addition of all crop residues, but were much greater under 70 than 40% WFPS (5.2 and 5133 mu g N-N2O kg(-1) soil for 40 and 70% WFPS, respectively). Under both WFPS, significantly higher peaks were detected after the application of N-rich legume residues (7.7 and 3,356 mu g N-N2O kg(-1) soil under 40 and 70% WFPS, respectively) than after the application of grass residues (2.8 and 1,777 mu g N-N2O kg(-1) soil under 40 and 70% WFPS, respectively). Cumulative soil N2O produced under 70% WFPS was approx. 110 times greater than under 40% WFPS. Soil N2O emissions increased linearly as residue N content increased. Soil N2O emissions also increased linearly as the content of the recalcitrant compounds lignin and polyphenols increased, because residues with high N content also had high lignin and polyphenols content. When the content of C and recalcitrant compounds were expressed on an N basis, soil N2O emission decreased linearly as residue C/N, lignin/N, polyphenol/N, and (lignin + polyphenols)/N ratios increased. Indices that include recalcitrant compounds on N basis may beuseful for the selection of cover-crop species withthe least impact on soil N2O emissions. However, our results show that these ratio indices had similar correlation coefficients compared to C/N ratio, indicating that C/N ratio is an efficient index to predict soil N2O emission following cover crop application.

AB The control of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions through nitrification and the optimization of maize yield are important in agricultural systems. However, within the semi-arid region, the impact of fertilization on the function of nitrification communities and its connection with N2O emissions in the rhizosphere soil is still unclear. Our study investigates the influence of fertilization treatments on the communities of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and the complete ammonia oxidizers of the Nitrospira known as comammox (CAOB) in a maize agroecosystem. Nitrous oxide production, potential nitrification activity (PNA), maize yield, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were determined for the same samples. The fertilizer treatments included a control group without fertilization (NA), inorganic fertilizer (CF), organic fertilizer (SM), combined inorganic and organic fertilizer (SC), and maize straw (MS). The SC treatment indicated a lower cumulative N2O emission than the CF treatment in the 2020 and 2021 cropping seasons. The AOB community under the CF, MS, and SM treatments was predominantly composed of Nitrosospira cluster 3b, while the SC treatment was associated with the comammox Nitrospira clade A.1 lineage, related to key species such as Ca. Nitrospira inopinata and Ca. Nitrospira nitrificans. Network analysis demonstrated a positive potential for competitive interaction between hub taxonomy and distinct keystone taxa among AOB and comammox Nitrospira nitrifiers. The structural equation model further revealed a significant positive association between AOB nitrifiers and N2O emission, PNA, soil pH, SOC, NO3--N, and DON under organic fertilization. The keystone taxa in the comammox Nitrospira nitrifier and network Module II exhibited a positive correlation with maize productivity and NUE, likely due to their functional activities stimulated by the SC treatment. It is noteworthy that the AOB community played a more significant role in driving nitrification compared to the composition of comammox Nitrospira. Collectively, combined inorganic and organic fertilizer (SC) treatment exhibits high potential for reducing N2O emissions, enhancing maize productivity, increasing NUE, and increasing the sustainability of the nitrogen dynamics of maize agroecosystems in the semi-arid Loess Plateau.

AB N2O and NO emissions from a winter wheat-summer maize rotation field with five different treatments in the North China Plain (NCP) were comparably investigated from 8 October 2014 to 11 October 2015. Compared with the treatments with only flood or drip irrigation, evident emission peaks of N2O and NO from the fertilization treatments with flood irrigation (A-Flood) and with drip fertigation (A-Drip) were observed after each fertilization event, whereas their emissions from the fertilization treatments with nitrification inhibitors under drip fertigation (A + DCD-Drip and A + Nitrapyrin-Drip) were greatly suppressed. The reduction effect of the nitrification inhibitors on N2O and NO emissions was found to be more conspicuous during the maize season than during the wheat season, implying that the soil temperature could play an important role in the reduction effect. Compared with the A-Flood treatment, the annual cumulative emission from the A-Drip treatment reduced by 22% for N2O and increased by 18% for NO, whereas the reductions of N2O and NO from the treatments with nitrification inhibitors could achieve as high as 66% and 95%, respectively. The yields of the maize were significantly greater from the A-Drip and A + Nitrapyrin-Drip treatments than from the A-Flood treatment, and the yields of the wheat were almost same among the treatments of A-Flood, A-Drip and A + DCD-Drip. Considering the yields, the water saving and the reduction of N2O and NO emissions, the application of nitrification inhibitor combined with drip fertigation is recommended in the NCP.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil are partly controlled by aeration and gas transfer in soil, and thus by soil structure. The intensity of N2O emissions is usually expressed according to the water filled pore space (WFPS), calculated using the soil bulk density. These factors, even if they describe the soil structure and the water proportion in the porous network, do not inform about porous network characteristics among scales and their connectivity. The aim of this work was therefore to determine (1) to what extent the soil structure of an agricultural soil controlled N2O emissions during a snap-shot campaign and (2) which metric of gas transfer or soil structure was the most appropriate to describe the N2O emission variability at field scale. N2O emissions were measured with a mobile chamber on a maize crop after fertilization with several soil management practices resulting in four soil states (strip-till versus tillage, compacted soil versus uncompacted) with contrasting soil structure. Soil cylinders and bulk soil were sampled from 24 plots exhibiting a strong gradient in N2O emissions. Classical soil physical and chemical properties were measured, including soil bulk density and water filled pore space. Soil structure also was characterized quantitatively by X-ray tomography at meso and macro scales, and indirectly by gas transfer parameters. Clear differences were observed between low and high emission plots in terms of soil structure, soil temperature and nitrate concentration. However, soil structure appeared more strongly connected to N2O emissions, and some thresholds on soil structural indicators were relevant to disentangle high and low N2O fluxes. Some structural indicators at both scales (e.g. porosity, surface density) and gas transfer parameters (relative gas diffusivity, air permeability) were good descriptors of the observed N2O fluxes. Nevertheless, the gas transfer parameters can be easily measured over a short period of time, whereas the soil structure indicators determined from 3D images require an acquisition and a processing phase that can be time consuming. A good compromise to evaluate the field N2O flux potential from an easy measure would be to evaluate the relative gas diffusivity, which directly controls the diffusion of oxygen in soil and thereby the microbial processes of N2O production.

AB N2O and NO emissions, the water usage and grain yields of a maize field in the North China Plain (NCP) under traditional flood irrigation, drip irrigation and drip fertigation were compared. With respect to the flood irrigation treatment, N2O emissions were reduced by 13.8% in the drip irrigation treatment and 7.7% in the drip fertigation treatment. NO emissions were reduced to 16.7% in the drip irrigation treatment but increased by 21.7% in the drip fertigation treatment. The molar ratios of NO/N2O within 2 days after each fertilization event were evidently greater from the drip fertigation treatment than from the flood irrigation treatment, indicating that nitrification was more intensive in the drip fertigation treatment than in the treatment of flood irrigation. Compared with the flood irrigation treatment, evident increase of the maize yields in the drip irrigation treatment (28%) and the drip fertigation treatment (3.7%) were found. Although the drip fertigation treatment could evidently increase NO emission, the 40% water reduction in drip fertigation is of great importance for the sustainable development of agriculture in the NCP where water resources are extremely limited. To mitigate NO emissions from agricultural fields in the NCP with drip fertigation, the addition of a nitrification inhibitor combined with N or nitrate fertilizer was recommended.

AB Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are a relevant contributor to the global warming potential of Mediterranean agro-ecosystems and therefore should be accurately quantified. Here, we investigated the quantitative relevance of considering postharvest N2O measurements when calculating annual soil N2O emissions from herbaceous crops (excluding rice). Data from 25 studies conducted in Mediterranean climates were compiled from a variety of crops and cropping systems, soil types, tillage practices, and nitrogen (N) fertilizer management practices. The differences between cumulative N2O emissions in the cropping period (preharvest emissions) and in the postharvest period were evaluated through a meta-analysis, as were the maximum N2O peaks in both periods and the resultant N2O emission factors (EFs). The relative contribution of the postharvest period to total cumulative N2O emissions was a mean 26%, but showed high variability. The average N2O EFs in the field experiments included in this study were 0.21% and 0.27% when not considering and when considering the postharvest period, respectively. The relative and absolute contribution of postharvest emissions was significantly greater for winter cereals than for either horticultural crops or maize. The maximum preharvest fluxes were higher than the maximum postharvest fluxes in 72% of the observations, but notable postharvest N2O peaks after soil rewetting were obtained in some studies. On average, postharvest emissions in nonfertilized plots were similar to those in fertilized winter crops. Other factors such as N source (greater relevance for organic fertilizers, particularly in summer crops), N rate, tillage intensity and soil texture significantly affected the amount of postharvest emissions. Taking measurements during the postharvest period in Mediterranean cropping systems are encouraged in studies that include winter crops, use of organic fertilizers or have unbalanced N rates. Our results may contribute to improving N2O measurement protocols and to re-evaluating N2O EFs in Mediterranean and semiarid areas.

AB IntroductionBrachiaria humidicola, a tropical grass, could release root exudates with biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) capacity and reduce soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from grasslands. However, evidence of the reduction effect in situ in tropical grasslands in China is lacking. MethodsTo evaluate the potential effects of B. humidicola on soil N2O emissions, a 2-year (2015-2017) field experiment was established in a Latosol and included eight treatments, consisting of two pastures, non-native B. humidicola and a native grass, Eremochloa ophiuroide, with four nitrogen (N) application rates. The annual urea application rates were 0, 150, 300, and 450 kg N ha(-1). ResultsThe average 2-year E. ophiuroides biomass with and without N fertilization were 9.07-11.45 and 7.34 t ha(-1), respectively, and corresponding values for B. humidicola increased to 31.97-39.07 and 29.54 t ha(-1), respectively. The N-use efficiencies under E. ophiuroide and B. humidicola cultivation were 9.3-12.0 and 35.5-39.4%, respectively. Annual N2O emissions in the E. ophiuroides and B. humidicola fields were 1.37 and 2.83 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively, under no N fertilization, and 1.54-3.46 and 4.30-7.19 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively, under N fertilization. DiscussionsAccording to the results, B. humidicola cultivation increased soil N2O emissions, especially under N fertilization. This is because B. humidicola exhibited the more effective stimulation effect on N2O production via denitrification primarily due to increased soil organic carbon and exudates than the inhibition effect on N2O production via autotrophic nitrification. Annual yield-scaled N2O emissions in the B. humidicola treatment were 93.02-183.12 mg N2O-N kg(-1) biomass, which were significantly lower than those in the E. ophiuroides treatment. Overall, our results suggest that cultivation of the non-native grass, B. humidicola with BNI capacity, increased soil N2O emissions, while decreasing yield-scaled N2O emissions, when compared with native grass cultivation.

AB Crop straw is converted to biochar with subsequent applications to soils as a multi-benefit strategy for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation, carbon sequestration, and straw disposal and utilization in intensive agriculture. However, tradeoffs between agronomic, economic, and environmental performance of long-term agricultural biochar use remain unclear. Using a case study of biochar-amended alkaline sandy loamy soil, we investigated the effects of field application of straw biochar at 0, 2.25, 6.75, and 11.25 Mg ha(-1) to 10 successive wheat and maize crop seasons over five rotation years on crop yield, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, soil total organic carbon (TOC), and soil carbon pool (SCP). The net global warming potential (net GWP) and net ecosystem economic benefit (NEEB) were assessed to examine the tension between balancing economic returns and environmental benefits. Results indicated that biochar treatments slightly increased total crop grain yields and greatly reduced the total N2O emissions over five rotation years. The soil total organic carbon content was enhanced while the CO2 emissions during biochar production almost offset the increase in the soil carbon pool. Economic assessment showed that the net ecosystem economic benefit was lowered with enhanced costs of the increasing biochar use under the current low C trade market. These results highlight the promotion of the use of straw biochar in successive applications as a strategy to effectively offset greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture requires optimization of the straw pyrolysis system to reduce the energy consumption and overall biochar costs, and price enhancement of C trade.

AB The semi-arid region of Chiapas is dominated by N-2-fixing shrubs, e. g., Acacia angustissima. Urea-fertilized soil samples under maize were collected from areas covered and uncovered by A. angustissima in different seasons and N2O and CO2 emissions were monitored. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of urea and of the rainy and dry season on gas emissions from semi-arid soil under laboratory conditions. Urea and soil use had no effect on CO2 production. Nitrons oxide emission from soil was three times higher in the dry than in the rainy season, while urea fertilization doubled emissions. Emissions were twice as high from soil sampled under A. angustissima canopy than from arable land, but 1.2 lower than from soil sampled outside the canopy, and five times higher from soil incubated at 40 % of the water-holding capacity (WHC) than at soil moisture content, but 15 times lower than from soil incubated at 100 WHC. It was found that the soil sampling time and water content had a significant effect on N2O emissions, while N fertilizer and sampling location were less influent.

AB Balancing efforts to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from crop production while increasing grain yields is an important challenge for agriculture. The objectives of this study were to assess N2O emissions, soil inorganic nitrogen (N) concentrations, grain yield, and grain N content for three enhanced-efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs) compared with anhydrous ammonia in a rainfed corn system in Illinois over 3 yr (2015-2017). Treatments included a control (check) and four N sources applied at 202 kg N ha(-1): injected anhydrous ammonia, stabilized urea containing urease and nitrification inhibitors (SuperU, Agrotain International), polymer-coated urea (ESN, Agrium Advanced Technologies), and injected urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) + nitrapyrin. Significant reductions in N2O emissions were observed for several EENFs compared with anhydrous ammonia, but results were not consistent across treatments and years. SuperU reduced area-and yield-scaled N2O emissions in two of three study years compared with anhydrous ammonia, while ESN had no N2O mitigation benefit. Injected UAN + nitrapyrin had the highest emissions in the first year but significantly decreased emissions in the second 2 yr. No treatment significantly improved yield or grain N content compared with anhydrous ammonia. In light of efforts to broadly promote EENFs in the US Midwest, these results demonstrate there is some promise for N2O mitigation, but the lack of clear crop productivity benefits combined with inconsistent N2O mitigation effects do not support the conclusion that EENFs inherently improve agronomic and environmental outcomes.

AB Fertilizer application is the basis for ensuring high yield, high quality and high efficiency of farmland. In order to meet the demand for food with the increasing of population, the application of nitrogen fertilizer will be further increased, which will lead to problems such as N2O emission and nitrogen loss from farmland, it will easily deteriorate the soil and water environment of farmland, and will not conducive to the sustainable development of modern agriculture. However, optimizing fertilizer management is an important way to solve this problem. While, due to the differences in the study conditions (geographical location, environmental conditions, experimental design, etc.), leading to the results obtained in the literatures about the N2O emission with different nitrogen fertilizer application strategies have significant differences, which requiring further comprehensive quantitative analysis. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of nitrogen fertilizer application strategies (different fertilizer types and fertilizer application rates) on N2O emissions from the fields (rice, wheat and maize) based on the Meta-analysis using 67 published studies (including 1289 comparisons). For the three crops, inorganic fertilizer application significantly increased on-farm N2O emissions by 19.7-101.05% for all three; and organic fertilizer increased N2O emissions by 28.16% and 69.44% in wheat and maize fields, respectively, but the application of organic fertilizer in rice field significantly reduced N2O emissions by 58.1%. The results showed that overall, the application of inorganic fertilizers resulted in higher N2O emissions from farmland compared to the application of organic fertilizers. In addition, in this study, the average annual temperature, annual precipitation, soil type, pH, soil total nitrogen content, soil organic carbon content, and soil bulk weight were used as the main influencing factors of N2O emission under nitrogen fertilizer strategies, and the results of the study can provide a reference for the development of integrated management measures to control greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soils.

AB The elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO(2)) is expected to increase the labile C input to the soil, which may stimulate microbial activity and soil N2O emissions derived from nitrification and denitrification. However, few studies studied the effect of eCO(2) on N2O emissions from maize field under the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) conditions in the warm temperate zone. Here, we report a study conducted during the 12th summer maize season under long-term eCO(2), aiming to investigate the effect of eCO(2) on N2O emissions. Moreover, we tested zero and conventional N fertilization treatments, with maize being grown under either eCO(2) or ambient CO2 (aCO(2)). We hypothesized that N2O emissions would be increased under eCO(2) due to changes in soil labile C and mineral N derived from C-deposition, and that the increase would be larger when eCO(2) was combined with conventional N fertilization. We also measured the activities of some soil extracellular enzymes, which could reflect soil C status. The results showed that, under eCO(2), seasonal N2O and CO2 emissions increased by 12.4-15.6% (p < 0.1) and 13.8-18.5% (p < 0.05), respectively. N fertilization significantly increased the seasonal emissions of N2O and CO2 by 33.1-36.9% and 17.1-21.8%, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of eCO(2) and N fertilization increased the intensity of soil N2O and CO2 emissions. The marginal significant increase in N2O emissions under eCO(2) was mostly due to the lower soil water regime after fertilization in the study year. Dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC) concentration showed a significant increase at most major stages, particularly at the tasseling stage during the summer maize growth period under eCO(2). In contrast, soil mineral N showed a significant decrease under eCO(2) particularly in the rhizospheric soils. The activities of C-related soil extracellular enzymes were significantly higher under eCO(2), particularly at the tasseling stage, which coincided with concurrent increased DOC and MBC under eCO(2). We conclude that eCO(2) increases N2O emissions, and causes a higher increase when combined with N fertilization, but the increase extent of N2O emissions was influenced by environmental factors, especially by soil water, to a great extent. We highlighted the urgent need to monitor long-term N2O emissions and N2O production pathways in various hydrothermal regimes under eCO(2).

TI Hot or Not? An Evaluation of Methods for Identifying Hot Moments of

AB Effectively quantifying hot moments of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils is critical for managing this potent greenhouse gas. However, we are challenged by a lack of standard approaches for identifying hot moments, including (a) determining thresholds above which emissions are considered hot moments, and (b) considering seasonal variation in the magnitude and frequency distribution of net N2O fluxes. We used one year of hourly N2O flux measurements from 16 autochambers that varied in flux magnitude and frequency distribution in a conventionally tilled maize field in central Illinois, USA, to compare three approaches to identify hot moment thresholds: standard deviations (SD) above the mean, 1.5x the interquartile range (IQR), and isolation forest (IF) identification of anomalous values. We also compared these approaches on seasonally subdivided data (early, late, and non-growing seasons) versus the whole year. Our analyses revealed that 1.5x IQR method best identified N2O hot moments. In contrast, using 2 or 4 SD both yielded hot moment threshold values too high, and IF yielded threshold values too low, leading to missed N2O hot moments or low net N2O fluxes mischaracterized as hot moments, respectively. Furthermore, seasonally subdividing the data set not only facilitated identification of smaller hot moments in the late- and non-growing seasons when N2O hot moments were generally smaller but it also increased hot moment threshold values in the early growing season when N2O hot moments were larger. Consequently, of the methods evaluated here, we recommend using the 1.5x IQR method on whole year data sets to identify N2O hot moments.

AB Vegetated riparian buffer strips have been established in Southern Quebec (Canada) in order to intercept nutrients such as nitrate (NO3-) and protect water quality near agricultural fields. Buffer strips may also favour denitrification through a combination of high soil moisture, NO3- and carbon supply, which could lead to the production of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas. Denitrification could be further amplified by the presence of earthworms, or by plant species that promote earthworm and bacterial activity in soils. Soils from four farms, comprising maize fields and adjacent buffer strips, were sampled in the fall of 2008. A total of six earthworm species were found, but average earthworm biomass did not differ between buffer strips and maize agroecoecosystems. Nitrate concentrations and net nitrification rates were higher in the maize fields than in the buffer strips: there was no difference in N2O production in soils collected from the two sampling locations. Potential denitrification, measured by acetylene inhibition, varied by two orders of magnitude, depending on experimental conditions: when amended with H2O or with H2O + NO3-, potential denitrification was higher (P < 0.05) in soils from buffer strips than from maize fields. Potential denitrification was highest in soils amended with H2O+glucose, or with H2O+ NO3- + glucose. Using microcosms, we tested the effect of litter-soil mixtures on earthworm growth, and the effect of earthworm-litter-soil mixtures on potential denitrification. Based on four categories of chemical assays, litters of woody species (oak, apple, Rhododendron) were generally of lower nutritional quality than litter from agronomic species (alfalfa, switchgrass, corn stover). Alfalfa litter had the most positive effect, whereas apple litter had the most negative effect, on earthworm growth. Potential denitrification was 2-4 times higher in earthworm-litter-soil mixtures than in plain soil. Litter treatments that included corn stover had lower potential denitrification than those that included alfalfa or switchgrass, whereas litter treatments that included oak had lower potential denitrification than those that included apple or Rhododendron. Results suggest that potential N2O emissions may be higher in riparian buffer strips than in adjacent maize fields, that N2O emissions in buffer strips may be amplified by comminuting earthworms, and that plant litters that reduce earthworm growth may not be best at mitigating N2O emissions.

AB With the addition of nitrogen (N), agricultural soils are the main anthropogenic source of N2O, but high spatial and temporal variabilities make N2O emissions difficult to characterize at the field scale. This study used flux-gradient measurements to continuously monitor N2O emissions at two agricultural fields under different management regimes in the inland Pacific Northwest of Washington State, USA. Automated 16-chamber arrays were also deployed at each site; chamber monitoring results aided the interpretation of the flux gradient results. The cumulative emissions over the six-month (1 April-30 September) monitoring period were 2.4 +/- 0.7 and 2.1 +/- 2 kg N2O-N/ha at the no-till and conventional till sites, respectively. At both sites, maximum N2O emissions occurred following the first rainfall event after N fertilization, and both sites had monthlong emission pulses. The no-till site had a larger N2O emission factor than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 emission factor of 1% of the N input, while the conventional-till site's emission factor was close to 1% of the N input. However, these emission factors are likely conservative. We estimate that the global warming potential of the N2O emissions at these sites is larger than that of the no-till conversion carbon uptake. We recommend the use of chambers to investigate spatiotemporal controls as a complementary method to micrometeorological monitoring, especially in systems with high variability. Continued monitoring coupled with the use of models is necessary to investigate how changing management and environmental conditions will affect N2O emissions.
   Plain Language Summary Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas and stratospheric ozone depleting substance that is emitted by soils. Agricultural soils tend to emit more N2O than natural soils due to the addition of nitrogen fertilizers. N2O emissions are not well understood on the scale of individual farms, as emissions are difficult to measure at this resolution because they are irregular over time and space. This variability is due to the dependence of N2O production and emission on soil properties, that is, moisture, nitrogen, and the microbiome. In this study we monitored N2O emissions from two agricultural fields under different tillage regimes using two complementary methods: the flux-gradient technique and automated chambers. The flux-gradient technique measures N2O emissions at the field scale, which is relevant to agronomic management. Using both techniques together improves confidence in our results, which give us information on total N2O emissions from these fields, as well as the relationships between N2O emissions and rainfall, temperature, and carbon dioxide respiration.

AB Straw retention has been widely implemented to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and green-house gas (GHG) mitigation for global agriculture. However, the combined effects of long-term straw retention on crop production, SOC sequestration and GHG emissions response to climate change remain unknown. Two nearby wheat-maize rotation field experiments in the North China Plain, combined with local weather, soil and agronomic measurements, were used to evaluate the applicability of the SPACSYS model. The model was then applied to assess the response of crop yield, SOC storage and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to three nitrogen fertilizer application levels (100, 200, 400 kg N ha(-1)) and three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) under straw retention for the wheat-maize rotation systems during 2021-2100. In general, the model was reasonably accurate with R-2 and model efficiency (EF) ranging from 0.25 to 0.96 and 0.32-0.94, respectively. Climate change decreased wheat yield by 4-39%, while maize showed a slight increase (3%) under RCP2.6 and a decrease of 1-15% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The SOC storage in the 0-20 cm soil increased at a rate of 73-195 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) but decreased within the upper 1 m soil at 280-390 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Climate change reduced the positive effect of SOC sequestration except in RCP2.6 and stimulated substantial N2O emissions ranging from 1-7.5 to 2.9-23.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), consequently, the global warming potential increased from -79-2555 to 548-9357 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) under various N fertilizer application levels. This study reveals that the negative feedback under climate change with modelling approach, and extensive efforts are needed to make adaptations to ensure food production and reduce GHG emissions in the future.

AB PurposeUrea combined with nitrification inhibitors (NI) can significantly reduce nitrous oxide emissions (N2O) compared to urea. However, there is a lack of evidence for higher agronomic benefits and better environmental benefits, i.e., the ability to minimize N2O emissions and improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) while maintaining high yield under N application rates lower than conventional N application rates.MethodsA 3-year in situ fertilization experiment was conducted under film mulching conditions in the Loess Plateau region with low rainfall. Three treatments of conventional N fertilization (CK), reduced N fertilization (RN), and RN with NI (RN + NI) were used to quantify soil N2O emissions, plant N uptake, NUE, and grain yield.ResultsRN and RN + NI treatments significantly reduced N2O emissions by 17.29-29.15% and 56.00-60.51%, respectively, and significantly increased NUE by 10.79-21.27% and 17.11-25.70%, respectively, compared with CK treatment. However, there was no significant difference in average plant N uptake (178.96-191.37 kg N ha-1) and grain yield (7.84-8.14 t ha-1) among CK, RN, and RN + NI treatments. Furthermore, higher available soil water storage at sowing and large rainfall events during the first month after fertilization would enhance the effect of NI on inhibiting N2O emissions, since the efficiency of NI in reducing N2O emissions depends on the level of water-filled pore space.ConclusionsTherefore, reducing N application combined with NI can be used as an effective N fertilizer management measure, which is helpful to achieve agriculture sustainable development in areas similar to the climate model of the Loess Plateau.

AB Agricultural fields are significant sources of anthropogenic atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). We compiled and analyzed data on N2O emissions from Japanese agricultural fields (246 measurements from 36 sites) reported in peer-reviewed journals and research reports. Agricultural fields were classified into three categories: upland fields, tea fields and rice paddy fields. In this analysis, data measured over a period of more than 90 days for upland fields and 209 days for tea fields were used to estimate annual fertilizer-induced emission factors (EF) because of limitations in the available data. The EF is defined as the emission from fertilized plots minus the background emission (emission from a zero-N control plot), and is expressed as a percentage of the N applied. The mean of N2O emissions from upland fields with well-drained soils was significantly lower than that from poorly drained soils. Mean (+/- standard deviation) N2O emissions measured over a period of more than 90 days from fertilized upland fields were 1.03 +/- 1.14 kg N ha(-1) and 4.78 +/- 5.36 kg N ha(-1) for well-drained and poorly drained soils, respectively. Because the ratio of the total areas of well-drained soils and poorly drained soils was different from the ratio of the number of available EF data for each soil category, we used a weighted mean to estimate EF for all upland fields. The EF was estimated to be 0.62 +/- 0.48% for all fertilized upland fields. Mean N2O emissions and the estimated EF for fertilized tea fields measured over a period of more than 209 days were 24.3 +/- 16.3 kg N ha(-1) and 2.82 +/- 1.80%, respectively. The mean N2O emission and estimated EF from Japanese rice paddy fields were 0.36 kg N ha(-1) and 0.31 +/- 0.31% for the cropping season, respectively. Significant uncertainties remain in these results because of limitations in the available data.

AB The potential of large-scale deployment of basalt to reduce N2O emissions from cultivated soils may contribute to climate stabilization beyond the CO2-removal effect from enhanced weathering. We used 3 years of field observations from maize (Zea mays) and miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) to improve the nitrogen (N) module of the DayCent model and evaluate the potential of basalt amendments to reduce N losses and increase yields from two bioenergy crops. We found 20%-60% improvement in our N2O flux estimates over previous model descriptions. Model results predict that the application of basalt would reduce N2O emissions by 16% in maize and 9% in miscanthus. Lower N2O emissions responded to increases in the N-2:N2O ratio of denitrification with basalt-induced increases in soil pH, with minor contributions from the impact of P additions (a minor component of some basalts) on N immobilization. The larger reduction of N2O emissions in maize than in miscanthus was likely explained by a synergistic effect between soil pH and N content, leading to a higher sensitivity of the N-2:N2O ratio to changes in pH in heavily fertilized maize. Basalt amendments led to modest increases in modeled yields and the nitrogen use efficiency (i.e., fertilizer-N recover in crop production) of maize but did not affect the productivity of miscanthus. However, enhanced soil P availability maintained the long-term productivity of crops with high nutrient requirements. The alleviation of plant P limitation led to enhanced plant N uptake, thereby contributing to lower microbial N availability and N2O emissions from crops with high nutrient requirements. Our results from the improved model suggest that the large-scale deployment of basalt, by reducing N2O fluxes of cropping systems, could contribute to the sustainable intensification of agriculture and enhance the climate mitigation potential of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage strategies.

AB The ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting (RFRH) system is an effective method for enhancing the rainfall water use efficiency and crop yield. Determining how the fertilization rate affects soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under the RFRH system has important practical significance for improving fertilization strategies and evaluating the environmental effects of the RFRH system. Therefore, we conducted a three-year field experiment in the Loess Plateau, China, to compare the RFRH system with traditional flat planting (T) at four different fertilizer rates (no fertilizer, N:P2O5 at 150:75 kg ha(-1), N:P2O5 at 300:150 kg ha(-1), and N:P2O5 at 450:225 kg ha(-1)). Under the same fertilization level, the soil water content (SWC) and dry matter were higher under RFRH compared with T, and the nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) content and N2O emissions were reduced. In the two planting models, SWC and NO3--N of each treatment and its corresponding N2O emission flux were significantly positively correlated. Under the same planting model, SWC decreased but NO3--N and the N2O emission increased with increasing fertilization rate. SWC was the key variable affecting the N2O emission flux in the RFRH system. In addition, the grain yield under RFRH increased by 2.2-28.0%, whereas the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) decreased by 1.0-16.1% and 13.0-56.8%, respectively, compared with T. The grain yield and GHGI had quadratic relationships with the fertilization rate. Moreover, GWP increased in a linear manner with the fertilizer rate. These findings suggest that the RFRH system is an effective tillage measure for reducing N2O emissions. When the N:P2O5 fertilization rate was 200:100 to 307:154 kg ha(-1), the RFRH system could maintain a higher grain yield and reduce the N2O emissions.

AB A long-term field experiment was performed to assess the effects of fertilization regimes on greenhouse gas emissions, soil properties, soil denitrifies, and maize (Zea mays) grain yield on Mollisols of Northeastern China. Chemical nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers plus pig manure (MNPK) treatment significantly increased soil N2O emissions by 29.9-226.4% and global warming potential (GWP) by 29.8-230.7% compared to unfertilized control (CK), chemical N fertilizer only (N), chemical N, P, and K fertilizers (NPK) and chemical N, P, and K fertilizers plus corn straw (SNPK) treatments. However, the MNPK treatment yielded similar greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) as compared with other treatments, mainly due to higher maize grain yield. There were also higher gene copy numbers of nirK, nirS, and nosZ in topsoil (0-20 cm depth) under MNPK treatment. Automatic linear modeling analysis indicated that main factors influencing soil N2O emissions were soil organic carbon (SOC), NO3- content, and nirK gene abundance. Although the application of chemical fertilizers plus organic manure increases N2O emissions due to higher N and C availability and nirK gene activity in the soil, this is still a promising fertilizer management due to its notable enhancement of maize grain yield and SOC content.

AB Background and aims Plant growth affects soil moisture, mineral N and organic C availability in soil, all of which influence denitrification. With increasing plant growth, root exudation may stimulate denitrification, while N uptake restricts nitrate availability. Methods We conducted a double labeling pot experiment with either maize (Zea mays L.) or cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) of the same age but differing in size of their shoot and root systems. The N-15 gas flux method was applied to directly quantify N2O and N-2 fluxes in situ. To link denitrification with available C in the rhizosphere, (CO2)-C-13 pulse labeling was used to trace C translocation from shoots to roots and its release by roots into the soil. Results Plant water and N uptake were the main factors controlling daily N2O + N-2 fluxes, cumulative N emissions, and N2O production pathways. Accordingly, pool-derived N2O + N-2 emissions were 30-40 times higher in the treatment with highest soil NO3- content and highest soil moisture. CO2 efflux from soil was positively correlated with root dry matter, but we could not detect any relationship between root-derived C and N2O + N-2 emissions. Conclusions Root-derived C may stimulate denitrification under small plants, while N and water uptake become the controlling factors with increasing plant and root growth.

AB A field experiment was carried out at the farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi to quantify the effect of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and different levels of N fertiliser application on nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from soil under maize. The experiment included five treatments: 60 kg N ha(-1) under ambient CO2 (385 ppm) in open plots, 120 kg N ha(-1) under ambient CO2 (385 ppm) in open plots, 160 kg N ha(-1) under ambient CO2 (385 ppm) in open plots, 120 kg N ha(-1) under ambient CO2 (385 ppm) in open top chambers (OTC) and 120 kg N ha(-1) under elevated CO2 (500 +/- 50 ppm) in the OTC. Peaks of N2O flux were observed after every dose of N application. Cumulative N2O emission was 13% lower under ambient CO2 as compared to the elevated CO2 concentrations. There was an increase in CO2 emissions with application of N from 60 kg ha(-1) to 160 kg ha(-1). Higher yield and root biomass was observed under higher N treatment (160 kg N ha(-1)). There was no significant increase in maize yield under elevated CO2 as compared to ambient CO2. The carbon emitted was more than the carbon fixed under elevated CO2 as compared to ambient CO2 levels. The carbon efficiency ratio (C fixed/C emitted) was highest in ambient CO2 treatment in the OTC.

AB Denitrifying bacteria produce and utilize nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. However, there is little information on how organic fertilization treatments affect the denitrifying communities and N2O emissions in the semi-arid Loess Plateau. Here, we evaluated how the denitrifying communities are responsible for potential denitrification activity (PDA) and N2O emissions. A field experiment was conducted with five fertilization treatments, including no fertilization (CK), mineral fertilizer (MF), mineral fertilizer plus commercial organic fertilizer (MOF), commercial organic fertilizer (OFP), and maize straw (MSP). Our result showed that soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were significantly increased under MSP treatment compared to MF treatment, while nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) followed the opposite trend. Organic fertilization treatments (MOF, OFP, and MSP treatments) significantly increased the abundance and diversity of nirS- and nosZ-harboring denitrifiers, and modified the community structure compared to CK treatment. The identified potential keystone taxa within the denitrifying bacterial networks belonged to the distinct genera. Denitrification potentials were significantly positively correlated with the abundance of nirS-harboring denitrifiers, rather than that of nirK- and nosZ-harboring denitrifiers. Random forest modeling and structural equation modeling consistently determined that the abundance, community composition, and network module I of nirS-harboring denitrifiers may contribute significantly to PDA and N2O emissions. Collectively, our findings highlight the ecological importance of the denitrifying communities in mediating denitrification potentials and the stimulatory impact of organic fertilization treatments on nitrogen dynamics in the semi-arid Loess Plateau.

AB Upland red soils have been identified as major CO2 and N2O sources induced by human activities such as fertilization. To monitor characteristics of soil surface CO2 and N2O fluxes in cropland ecosystems after continuous fertilizer applications over decades and to separate the respective contributions of root and heterotrophic respiration to the total soil CO2 and N2O fluxes, the measurements of soil surface CO2 and N2O fluxes throughout the maize growing season in 2009 were carried out based on a fertilization experiment (from 1990) through of the maize (Zea mays L.) growing season in red soil in southern China. Five fertilization treatments were chosen from the experiment for study: zero-fertilizer application (CK), nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizer application only, pig manure (M), NPK plus pig manure (NPKM) and NPK with straw (NPKS). Six chambers were installed in each plot. Three of them are in the inter-row soil (NR) and the others are in the soil within the row (R). Each fertilizer treatment received the same amount of N (300 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Results showed that cumulative soil CO2 fluxes in NR or R were both following the order: NPKS>M, NPKM>NPK>CK. The contributions of root respiration to soil CO2 fluxes was 40, 44, 50, 47 and 35% in CK, NPK, NPKM, M and NPKS treatments, respectively, with the mean value of 43%. Cumulative soil N2O fluxes in NR or R were both following the order: NPKS, NPKM>M>NPK>CK, and soil N2O fluxes in R were 18, 20 and 30% higher than that in NR in NPKM, M and NPKS treatments, respectively, but with no difference between NR and R in NPK treatment. Furthermore, combine with soil temperature at -5 cm depth and soil moisture (0-20 cm) together could explain 55-70% and 42-59% of soil CO2 and N2O emissions with root interference and 62-78% and 44-63% of that without root interference, respectively. In addition, soil CO2 and N2O fluxes per unit yield in NPKM (0.55 and 0.10 kg C t(-1)) and M (0.65 and 0.13 g N t(-1)) treatments were lower than those in other treatments. Therefore, manure application could be a preferred fertilization strategy in red soils in South China

AB Microbial nitrification and denitrification are responsible for the majority of soil nitrous (N2O) emissions. In this study, N2O emissions were measured and the abundance of ammonium oxidizers and denitrifiers were quantified in purple soil in a long-term fertilization experiment to explore their relationships. The average N2O fluxes and abundance of the amoAgene in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria during the observed dry season were highest when treated with mixed nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizer (NPK) and a single N treatment (N) using NH(4)HCO(3)as the sole N source; lower values were obtained using organic manure with pig slurry and added NPK at a ratio of 40%:60% (OMNPK),organic manure with pig slurry (OM) and returning crop straw residue plus synthetic NH(4)HCO(3)fertilizer at a ratio of 15%:85% (SRNPK). The lowest N2O fluxes were observed in the treatment that used crop straw residue(SR) and in the control with no fertilizer (CK). Soil NH(4)(+)provides the substrate for nitrification generating N2O as a byproduct. The N2O flux was significantly correlated with the abundance of the amoA gene in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (r=0.984, p<0.001), which was the main driver of nitrification. During the wet season, soil nitrate (NO3-) and soil organic matter (SOC) were found positively correlated with N2O emissions (r=0.774, p=0.041 and r=0.827, p=0.015, respectively). The nirS gene showed a similar trend with N2O fluxes. These results show the relationship between the abundance of soil microbes and N2O emissions and suggest that N2O emissions during the dry season were due to nitrification, whereas in wet season, denitrification might dominate N2O emission.

AB Green manure (GM) is promising for use in sustainable agriculture, but its impacts on nitrogen emissions from farmland and crop productivity are unclear. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis based on 2,616 data pairs from 218 studies to clarify the effects of GM. GM enhanced soil nitrogen retention to increase the crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by 3.71 % and 24.41 %, respectively, and reduce ammonia (NH3) emissions by 9.09 %, but with no significant impact on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. GM was most effective in low-quality soil and warm, humid climates, especially legume GM. Combining GM with high nitrogen fertilizer use may further reduce NH3 emissions. Machine learning models showed that GM could increase global maize and rice yields by 9.78 % and 11.10 %, respectively, and reduce NH3 emissions from major crops by 9.92 %, but increase N2O emissions from paddy fields by 9.45 %. In general, GM can enhance crop productivity and reduce agricultural environmental costs to promote green development.

AB Our experiment aimed at studying the impact of long term tillage treatments - reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT), on CO2 and N2O emissions by soil and at describing the dynamics of N2O fluxes. Gas measurements were performed from June to October 2015 in a Belgian maize crop, with homemade automated closed chambers, allowing continuous measurement at a high temporal resolution. After 7 years of treatment, CO2 and N2O average emissions were significantly larger in the RT parcel than in the CT parcel. This observation was attributed to the effect of tillage on the distribution of crop residues within the soil profile, leading to higher soil organic C and total N contents and a greater microbial biomass in the upper layer in RT. A single N2O emission peak triggered by a sudden increase of water filled pore space (VVFPS) was observed in the beginning of the measuring campaign. The absence of large emission afterwards was most likely due to a decreasing availability of N as crop grew. N2O background fluxes showed to be significantly correlated to CO2 fluxes but not to VVFPS, while. the influence of soil temperature remained unclear. Our results question the suitability of reduced tillage as a "climate-smart" practice and suggest that more experiments be conducted on conservation practices and their potent negative effect on environment.

AB The frequent observation of negative N2O fluxes reveals a significant but overlooked soil sink, yet its potential and mechanisms under zero nitrogen (N) fertilisation remain unclear, since high-N fertiliser application induced N2O emission pulses generally obscured the role of N2O uptake. To explore the uptake potentials and driving mechanisms under zero-N fertilisation, a 3-year in situ field study (from June 2013 to May 2016) on maize-wheat rotation systems in the North China Plain was conducted, using high-resolution sampling of N2O fluxes and meteorological metadata (fluxes were every 2-3 days) and biological analysis (measured in 2015-2016). The results showed that contrasting patterns of N2O emissions between the wheat season (-492.6 g N ha-1) and maize season (443.5 g N ha-1) were recorded, and the N2O sink of the wheat season was 1.10 times that of the N2O source from the maize season during the whole experiment. Further analysis of predictor variables identified that temperature, nitrate content and nosZ abundances were the key explanatory variables for N2O uptake by wheat field soils, while denitrification, nitrate content and relatively higher abundances of AOA, AOB, NOB, nirS and/or nirK characterised maize soils. Therefore, a probable mechanism for N2O uptake by wheat field soils was that, during the wheat season, typical low temperatures extremely restricted microbial denitrification activities and decreased nitrate substrate accessibility. Moreover, higher temperature and anoxic conditions within subsurface soils provided more helpful conditions for microbial conversion of N2O to N2 with greater nosZ gene abundances. Overall, this study characterised a significantly underestimated N2O sink in the wheat season with zero-N fertilisation. These findings contribute to modifying the conventional understanding that cropland soil is always a major source of N2O emissions to the atmosphere, and also provide new insight for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation under the dual carbon strategy.

AB In the Brazilian Cerrado, despite the increasing adoption of no-till systems, there are still extended areas under conventional soil management systems that reduce soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and increase the emissions of greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide (N2O). Conservation agroecosystems, such as no-till, have been proposed as a strategy to mitigate agriculture-induced climatic changes through reductions in N2O emissions. However, the relationship between organic matter and N2O emissions from soils under different agroecosystems is not yet clear. This study hypothesized that agroecosystems under no-till promote an accumulation of labile and stable SOM fractions along with a reduction of N2O emissions. This study evaluated the effects of crop-rotation agroecosystems: i) on C and N pools and labile and stable SOM fractions; ii) on cumulative N2O emissions; and iii) on the relationships between SOM fractions and N2O emissions. The agricultural systems consisted of: (I) soybean followed by sorghum under no-tillage (NT1); (II) maize followed by pigeon pea under no-tillage (NT2); (III) soybean under conventional tillage followed by fallow soil (CT); (IV) and native Cerrado (CER). After CT for 18 years, following the replacement of CER, the soil C stock in the 0-20 cm layer was reduced by 0.64 t ha(-1) year(-1). The no-till systems were more efficient in accumulating labile and stable C fractions with values close to those observed under CER, and were directly related to lower soil N2O emissions. The cumulative pattern of N2O emissions was inverse to that of the following SOM fractions: microbial biomass carbon, permanganate-oxidizable carbon, particulate organic carbon, inert carbon, and humic substances. Based on principal component analysis, the CT was generally separated from the other land use systems. This separation was strongly influenced by the low C contents in the different SOM fractions and higher N2O emissions promoted by the CT. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We measured nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from the soil surface and in the soil through to a depth of 0.3 m, and their concentration profiles through to a depth of 0.6 m in both a Gray Lowland soil with macropores and cracks and an Andosol with undeveloped soil structure in central Hokkaido, Japan. The objective of the present study was to elucidate any differences in N2O production and flux in the soil profile between these two soil types. In the Gray Lowland soil, the N2O concentration above 0.4 m increased with an increase in soil depth. In the Andosol, there were no distinctive N2O concentration gradients in the topsoil when the N2O flux did not increase. However, the N2O concentration at a depth of 0.1 m significantly increased and this concentration was higher than the concentration below 0.2 m when the N2O flux greatly increased. Thus, the N2O concentration profiles were different between these two soils. The contribution ratios of the N2O produced in the top soil (0-0.3 m depth) to the total N2O emitted from the soil to the atmosphere in the Gray Lowland soil and the Andosol were 0.86 and 1.00, respectively, indicating that the N2O emitted from the soil to the atmosphere was mainly produced in the top soil. However, the contribution ratio of the subsoil to the N2O emitted from the Gray Lowland soil was higher than that of the Andosol. There was a significant positive correlation between the N2O flux through to a 0.3 m depth and the flux from the soil to the atmosphere in the Gray Lowland soil only. These results suggest that N2O production in the subsoil of the Gray Lowland soil could have been activated by NO3- leaching through macropores and cracks, and subsequently the N2O produced in the subsoil could have been rapidly emitted to the atmosphere through the macropores and cracks.

AB This study investigated the impact of biochar on Zea mays L. yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in rainfed maize fields in Northwest China. Four treatments were compared: unmodified control (CK), conventional nitrogen (BC0), nitrogen + 20 t ha-1 biochar (BC20), and nitrogen + 50 t ha-1 biochar (BC50). Results showed significant increases in grain yields with BC20 (11.1%) and BC50 (8.6%) compared to BC0. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) were reduced by 14.0%-19.5% in biochar treatments compared to CK. Methane (CH4) uptake by the fields, acting as CH4 sinks, was not significantly impacted by biochar treatments, clarifying that the biochar did not alter the farmland's inherent ability to uptake CH4. Over 2 years, the addition of nitrogen fertilizer and biochar did not markedly alter cumulative CH4 uptake. Both net greenhouse gas (NGHG) emissions and yield-scaled GHG intensity (NGHGI) were lowered by 16.7%-23.5% and 24.2%-30.3%, respectively, with biochar application. The integration of biochar effectively mitigated the GHG emission enhancement due to nitrogen fertilizer, mainly by decreasing nitrogen oxide emissions and boosting maize yields. Thus, proper biochar application would be an economical and effective strategy for mitigating gas emissions from rainfed maize cropping system in semiarid regions.
   Biochar significantly increased maize yield in a rainfed cropping system. N2O emission was significantly decreased by 10.9%-19.5% by biochar application. Biochar significantly decreased net global warming potentials (NGWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). Higher amount of biochar had no further decrease effect on NGWP and GHGI.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural land are often estimated by measuring changes in N2O concentrations over a given period in the headspace of a gas-sampling chamber covering a specific soil area. This technique is particularly challenging in tall growing row crops such as maize (Zea mays L.), to which farmers regularly apply fertilizer banded below the seeds to ensure good crop development. Placing chambers in the inter-row space leads to bias in flux measurements, due to exclusion of fertilized and rhizosphere soil. Chambers for N2O flux measurements should therefore be placed centered over the row. A new split chamber for gas sampling was developed in this study from a closed, rectangular chamber (original chamber: 78cm x 78 cm, 51 cm height). The new chamber is applicable for use for the complete maize growing cycle until harvest. For each flux measurement, the two parts of the chambers are placed in a gas-tight seal on a collar previously inserted into soil covering a representative area of land. In a later growth stage, when plant height exceeds chamber height, stalks of developed maize plants can be fixed between the two chamber parts through a rubber-tightening opening on the top of the chamber. Air tightness of the split chamber was tested in the laboratory and the split chamber was compared with the original chamber in a field experiment with slurry injection under maize seeds. The laboratory test demonstrated similar air tightness of both chamber types. The field test yielded almost identical N2O fluxes for the original chamber (244 mu g N2O-N m(-1) h(-1)) and the split-chamber (254 mu g N2O-N m(-1) h(-1)). It can be concluded that the split chamber is an adequate gas-sampling unit, with particular advantages when flux measurements are conducted in tall growing row crops.

AB The denitrification rate in C2H2-amended intact soil cores and soil N2O fluxes in closed static chambers were monitored in a Mediterranean irrigated maize-cropped field. The measurements were carried out during: (i) a standard fertilization management (SFM) activity and (ii) a manipulation experimental (ME) test on the effects of increased and reduced application rates of urea at the late fertilization. In the course of the SFM, the irrigations following early and late nitrogen fertilization led to pulses of denitrification rates (up to 1300 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) and N2O fluxes (up to 320 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)), thanks to the combined action of high soil temperatures and not limiting nitrates and water filled pore space (WFPS). During the ME, high soil nitrates were noted in all the treatments in the first one month after the late fertilization, which promoted marked N-losses by microbial denitrification (from 500 to 1800 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) every time the soil WFPS was not limiting. At similar maize yield responses to fertilizer treatments, this result suggested no competition for N between plant roots and soil microbial community and indicated a probable surplus of nitrogen fertilizer input at the investigated farm. Correlation and regression analyses (CRA) on the whole set of data showed significant relations between both the denitrification rates and the N2O fluxes with three soil physical-chemical parameters: nitrate concentration, WFPS and temperature. Specifically, the response functions of denitrification rate to soil nitrates, WFPS and temperature could be satisfactorily modelled according to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetic, exponential and linear functions, respectively. Furthermore, the CRA demonstrated a significant exponential relationship between N2O fluxes and denitrification and simple empirical functions to predict N2O emissions from the denitrification rate appeared more fitting (higher concordance correlation coefficient) than the predictive empirical algorithm based on soil nitrates, WFPS and temperature. In this regard, the empirically established relationships between the denitrification rate on intact soil cores under field conditions and the soil variables provided local-specific threshold values and coefficients which may effectively work to calibrate and adapt existing N2O process-based simulation models to the local pedo-climatic conditions.

AB Irrigation with wastewater is an increasing practice around the world triggered by the large needs of water for agriculture. Many times this source of water is added by flooding to the fields, creating short temporal oxygen-depleted environments, where nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are promoted. Agriculture is responsible for up to 60% of the global annual emissions of this gas, and its emission factors (EF) must be reported. During 21 months, we installed closed chambers to measure the N2O emissions from a wastewater irrigated plot in the Mezquital Valley. Here, alfalfa, rye grass, and maize were grown in succession, receiving mainly organic N contained in the untreated wastewater and the residues of the previous crop; only maize received extra mineral fertilization of 100 kg of N ha(-1). We obtained a time series where the gaps were filled by linear interpolation. EF and N2O direct emissions were estimated by the Tier 1 approach of the IPCC. We found that the alfalfa and rye grass, which only receive organic nitrogen, produced minor N2O emissions, that reflected in lower EF (0.004 and 0.001, respectively), compared with the default value of the IPCC (0.01). In contrast, maize, which receives organic and inorganic N, lost 1% of this N input as N2O, the same as the default value (0.01). It seems that the form of N, the crop age and type influence greatly the N dynamics in this wastewater irrigated land-use system. Therefore, the Tier I approach of the IPCC seems to underestimate the N efficiency of this agroecosystem and overestimates the N2O direct emissions from alfalfa and rye grass. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB There are few studies that have assessed greenhouse gas (GHG) effluxes under dryland agriculture, especially in South Africa. Subsequently, limited data in the sub-Saharan region impedes the formulation of policies on GHG mitigation and adaptation. Therefore, the need to study effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) was salient. The objective of the study was to assess GHG effluxes across seasons in conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) systems under nitrogen (N) fertilizer management. Gases were sampled using static PVC chambers and sampling was done by inserting a 25-mL polypropylene syringe into the chamber septa and slowly removing the gas. Samples were analysed for CO2, CH4 and N2O using gas chromatography. In winter, CH4 effluxes were higher under NT than CT for each application rate (p < 0.05). N2O efflux was higher (p < 0.05) under CT at 120 and 240 kg N ha(-1) compared to NT in summer. The CO2 effluxes of CT were higher (p < 0.05) than NT at all N application rates and seasons. Higher GHG effluxes in summer than winter was attributed to higher soil temperature and moisture. CO2 and N2O emissions were positively correlated to tillage with CH4 negatively correlated, but it has to be noted that not only the intensity of tillage influenced effluxes, but also climatic conditions played a huge role in determining the direction of effluxes. Conservation tillage is climate smart and, in this case NT at 120 kg N ha(-1), can be recommended because it sustained less effluxes especially during summer.

AB The present study aimed to assess the efficiency of zeolite in mitigating the nitrogen (N) losses through ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from pig slurry (PS) applied to Italian ryegrass (IRG)-maize fields under a crop rotation system and the consequent effect on nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for forage production. PS was applied at rates of 150 and 200 kg N ha -1 for the IRG and maize growing seasons, respectively, with or without zeolite. Soil mineral N content and NH3 and N2O emissions were measured periodically throughout the year-round cultivation of IRG and maize. Forage yield and nutritional composition were also analyzed at the harvest time of each crop. The PS with/without zeolite application effects were interpreted by comparison with those obtained for the negative control (no -N fertilization). Soil ammonium (NH4+) content in the PS-applied plots sharply increased within the first week, then progressively decreased in both the IRG and maize growing seasons. Soil NH4+ contents in the zeolite-amended plots were higher compared to the treatment without zeolite except for the first 1 or 2 weeks after PS application when soil nitrate (NO3-) contents significantly decreased. The increase in soil NH4+ content as affected by zeolite application was more distinct in the maize growing season than in the IRG growing season. NH3 emission was predominant at the early 2 weeks after PS application. Zeolite application reduced the cumulative emission of NH3 from PS by 16.7% and 24.4% and that of N2O by 15.6% and 31.5% in the IRG growing and maize growing seasons, respectively. NUE for dry matter (DM) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) production significantly improved in annual yield basis of the IRG-maize cropping. Zeolite application in PS-applied field may represent effective management in mitigating N losses through odorous NH3 and greenhouse gas (N2O) emissions, thereby improving NUE forage production.

AB In Madagascar, no-tillage practices were developed since the early 90s to prevent soil erosion and improve soil fertility. Although such practices have helped to restore soil carbon in most cases, the impact on N2O emissions has not been investigated yet. The soil N2O fluxes and concentrations were measured during the growing season of an intercropping maize-soybean on a clayey soil of the Malagasy Highlands. Management treatments consisted of direct seeding mulch based cropping system (DMC) and traditional hand-ploughing after the preceding crop residues were harvested (HP), both with low N inputs (55-57 kg N ha(-1)). No significant difference in N2O emissions was observed between treatments (DMC vs. HP). The N2O fluxes were weakly correlated to soil mineral N contents (R-2=0.13; P=0.03) while no relationship was emphasized with soil water filled pore space (WFPS), N2O Concentrations in the soil atmosphere were correlated to fluxes at the soil surface and to soil WFPS. N2O emissions at the soil surface were low ranging from 0 to 8.84 g N-N2O ha(-1) d(-1), probably due to the low mineral N content of soil. The cumulative annual N2O emission was 0.26 kg N ha(-1) for both systems. The corresponding N loss as N2O-N was around 0.5% of applied N. This is in the uncertainty range of IPCC N2O emission factor (EF), but the IPCC EF mean estimate (1%) would overestimate true N2O emissions for the soil under evaluation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB No-tillage (NT) has been largely adopted in Brazil as a strategy for soil conservation, but for the last decade, there have been governmental incentives for its adoption arising from its potential for soil C accumulation. Notwithstanding, the soil mulch formed from crop residues favors the maintenance of soil moisture and nutrients in the upper soil layers, which stimulates soil microbial activity and may increase the potential for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. In addition, double-cropping systems in the same year are typical in Brazil and the impact on the fraction of fertilizer N lost as N2O needs to be evaluated. This study aimed to assess the influence of soil tillage and N fertilization on N2O emissions in a wheat-soybean succession system as commonly practiced in southern Brazil. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Soybean research station located in Southern Brazil. Treatments were conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), with and without nitrogen fertilization for the wheat and no N fertilizer for the soybean. Closed-static chambers were used to monitor N2O fluxes for two consecutive years. Together with gas monitoring, soil samples were also taken and analyzed for mineral N, soil moisture and labile carbon. Soybean yields were higher under NT, which seemed to be the result of a higher soil water availability that helped to overcome extended periods without rainfall. Soil N2O emissions were similar between CT and NT, with just a tendency for higher emissions under NT. The highest emissions occurred from the soybean crop. In the second year under NT, the emissions from the soybean crop were higher when preceded by N-fertilized wheat, but the converse was true under CT. None of the soil variables consistently correlated with N2O emissions, with mineral-N as the best predictor in the second wheat cycle and soil moisture in the first soybean cycle. Calculated emission factors were not statistically different between CT and NT and consistently lower than the IPCC default of 1 %. The calculated N2O emission intensity by relating N2O emission to grain yield showed an environmental advantage of NT compared to CT by presenting a 44 % reduction in soybean and similar values for fertilized wheat.

AB Extreme flood events are predicted to have a negative impact on soil quality. Currently, there is a lack of information about the effect of agricultural practices on soil functioning and microbial processes under these events. We hypothesized that the impact of flooding on soil quality will be exacerbated when crop residues are present in the soil as they will induce more extreme anaerobicity. A spring extreme flood event (10 A degrees C, 9 weeks) was simulated in mesocosms containing an arable sandy-loam soil low in nutrients. The main treatments were (1) with and without flooding and (2) with and without maize residue addition (8 Mg ha(-1)). We monitored changes in soil chemical quality indicators (e.g. pH, salinity, Fe3+, P, C, NH4 (+), NO3 (-) and organic N), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) and soil microbial community composition (PLFAs) during a prolonged flood period (9 weeks) and an 8-week "recovery" period after flooding. In comparison to the other treatments, flooding in the presence of crop residues resulted in a dramatic drop in soil redox potential. This was associated with the enhanced release of Fe and C into solution and an increase in CH4 emissions. In contrast, maize residues reduced potential nitrate losses and N2O emissions, possibly due to complete denitrification and microbial N immobilization. Both flooding and maize residues stimulated microbial growth and promoted a shift in microbial community composition. Following floodwater removal, most of the soil quality indicators returned to the levels of the control treatment within 5 weeks. After this short recovery phase, no major impact of flooding could be observed on plant growth (maize pot-grown). Overall, we conclude that both extreme flooding and management regime negatively impact upon a range of soil quality indicators (e.g. redox, GHG emissions); however, the soil showed high resilience and recovered quickly after floodwater removal. Further work is required to investigate the impact of repeated extreme flood events on soil quality and function over longer timescales.

AB Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration generally stimulates nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from upland soils, leading to a promoted feedback on climate change. However, the underlying mechanisms on how elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) stimulates N2O emissions from nitrogen (N)-fertilized upland soils remain poorly known. Here, we investigated the effects of eCO(2) on soil N2O production pathways and associated gross N transformation rates, as well as on nitrifying and denitrifying microbes. Based on a 13 years of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) platform, we found that N2O emissions were significantly increased by 46.7% under eCO(2) in a typical summer-maize field. The N-15 tracing experiment showed that autotrophic nitrification rate was significantly increased by 11.6% under eCO(2), coincided with the significantly higher abundance and shift composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) under eCO(2). Also, eCO(2) enhanced gross ammonium (NH4+) immobilization rate but reduced gross nitrate (NO3-) immobilization rate. Autotrophic nitrification accounted for approximately 78% of N2O emissions, followed by heterotrophic nitrification (about 19%) and denitrification (about 3%). It was found that eCO(2) increased carbon (C) deposition in soil, which could affect the availability of soil labile organic C and N and alter the composition and activity of nitrifiers. These changes promoted the N2O production derived from autotrophic nitrification, resulting in higher N2O emissions under eCO(2). We could deduce that nitrifier denitrification contributed to the increased N2O emissions greatly under eCO(2), derived by strongly stimulated ammonia oxidation and microbial respiration (i.e. higher soil CO2 emissions) caused suboxic conditions (i.e. lower soil oxygen (O-2) concentration), along with higher abundance ratios of (nirK+nirS)/nosZ. Our results suggest that controlling autotrophic nitrification appropriately is crucial for mitigating N2O emissions from upland soils under rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.

AB Agriculture contributes to 98% and 33% of ammonia and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Ireland, respectively. Those emissions are mainly associated with livestock production. The Gothenburg Protocol and the EU National Emissions Ceilings Directive are policy drivers which set new and more demanding targets from 2020 to reduce these gaseous emissions. A field experiment was set up in Wexford (Ireland) between April 2009 and August 2010, on a grassland site established with a uniform ryegrass (Lolium perenne) sward for more than ten years. The objective was to investigate the impact of slurry dry matter (DM) content, application technique and timing of application on the overall GHG balance from cattle slurry applied to grassland soils. The treatments on plots were a control, calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and cattle slurry, either grass-based or maize-based and with varying DM contents, applied by mimicking trailing shoe and splash plate application. The dry matter contents were varied by mixing different ratios of faeces and urine. The results showed that, while ammonia (NH3) volatilisation losses were significantly increased on slurry spread plots, cumulative direct nitrous oxide emissions, and corresponding emission factors, were significantly higher when applying CAN. In terms of GHG field balance, the potential decrease in indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, calculated from a reduction of ammonia volatilisation losses using trailing shoe as opposed to splash plate, could be easily offset by an increase in direct N2O emissions and ecosystem respiration. Switching from summer to spring application was much more efficient for mitigation of both NH3 and GHG emissions, due to favourable soil and climatic factors which enhanced crop growth. Any potential trade-off between NH3 and N2O emissions was cancelled, leading to an overall positive effect on reactive nitrogen losses and offering agronomic benefits to farmers.

AB Managed grasslands are periodically renewed in north-western Europe, primarily in response to a decline in yield and nutritive value or sward damage. Grassland conversion to arable land is also a common agricultural practice on intensively used grassland sites. However, depending on the soil and its management, grassland break-up (i.e. the destruction of the grass sward and soil disturbance) is associated with the mineralisation of soil organic nitrogen (N) and the decomposition of stubbles and roots from the old grass sward, with both leading to enhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3-) leaching. Two sites were set up to investigate the effects of different grassland renewal techniques (keeping and improving the old sward, chemical sward killing and chemical killing of the sward followed by ploughing) with grassland conversion to maize cropping and permanent grassland as the reference treatments. The sites (Histic Gleysol and a Plaggic Anthrosol) differed in their organic matter content and groundwater level. N2O fluxes were measured weekly using static closed chambers for a period of two years. The relationship between N2O fluxes and explanatory/controlling variables was investigated using generalised additive models (GAM). The potential NO3- losses via NO3- leaching were quantified by taking weekly measurements of the soil mineral N (Mak) from the topsoil layer (0-30 cm) and from depth profiles (0-90 cm) in the autumn (pre-winter) and spring (post-winter). The aboveground biomass in the different treatments was also measured. Grassland renewal was not a significant source of direct N2O emissions at either experimental site during the two years of the study. There was only a short two-month period during which there were significantly increased N2O fluxes (up to a maximum of 1.6 kg N2O ha-1 day-1 in the Histic Gleysol) and treatment differences. N fertilisation (as reflected in the N content in soil), soil moisture, and microbial and plant respiratory activity were identified as important drivers of N2O emission. The destruction of the old grass sward (i.e. chemical killing by herbicide application and ploughing and conversion to maize cropping) resulted in an increased net N release of Nmin during the first year, which indicated losses via indirect N2O emission and a higher risk of NO3- leaching, especially on the sandy Plaggic Anthrosol. No yield effects were found after grassland renewal at either site. With respect to N2O mitigation and the prevention of NO3- leaching, it is recommended that the new grass sward should be rapidly established as a sink for Nmin and that the amount of available mineralised N following grassland renewal is taken into account when applying N fertiliser, as mineralisation following sward destruction provides high amounts of plant-available N.

AB The magnitudes and source partitioning of soil dinitrogen (N-2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are not well documented, yet. To address both issues for black soil subject to a typical cool temperate climate, soil N2O and N-2 fluxes following the basal application event of an ammonium-based fertilizer (labeled by N-15) for maize were simultaneously measured in situ by using the N-15 gas flux ((15)NFG) method. During the two-month field experiment, the measured N-2 and N2O fluxes cumulated to 1.61 +/- 0.47 and 0.12 +/- 0.01 kg N ha(-1), respectively, showing N2O to N2O plus N-2 ratios (R-N2O) of 0.02-0.31 (0.15 on average). Temperature was identified as a key factor regulating the total soil N-2 fluxes (r(2) = 0.27, p < 0.01), despite the N-2 fluxes originated from nitrate denitrification related to dissolved organic carbon concentrations (r(2) = 0.39, p < 0.01). Differently, both temperature and soil moisture jointly accounted for 85% and 74% of the variances in the N2O fluxes and the R-N2O values, respectively (p < 0.01). Moreover, the process(es) other than autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification could be of substantial importance for the soil N2O emissions. Our findings emphasized the importance of temperature in regulating N-2 emissions from black soil and the possible site- and/or time specificity of a soil factors-based parametrization of R-N2O. In addition, this study implicates that labeling a nitrogen substrate of nitrification while using the N-15 enrichment of N2O is necessary to more accurately quantify total soil N-2 fluxes in situ by using the (15)NFG approach even though further confirmation in future studies is still needed.

AB Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are affected by management practices, but little information is available on the interactive effects of tillage, cropping systems and N sources in tropical and subtropical soils. In an 18-yr old experiment located in a subtropical Acrisol of Southern Brazil we conducted a sequence of two trials. The 1-year trial (October 2003-2004) was set to evaluate the long-term effects of tillage [CT: conventional; and NT: no-tillage] and cropping systems [O/M: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.)/maize (Zea mays L.); and V/M; vetch (Vicia sativa L.)/maize] on soil N2O emissions, either in the post-management period (45 days after desiccation and knife-rolling of winter cover crops) or in the whole year. The second and short-term trial (October-November 2004) was carried out to compare the impact of N sources [urea (mineral) and legume-residue of vetch (biologically fixed), both at 180 kg N ha(-1)] on soil N2O emissions during 53 days after cover-crop management. Air sampling was carried out by static chambers and N2O analysis by gas chromatography. In the 45-day post-management period of the 1-year trial, soil N2O emissions were practically not affected by tillage systems, but increased 4 times due to vetch residues (average of 0.40 +/- 0.08 kg N ha(-1) in V/M versus 0.10 +/- 0.05 kg N ha(-1) in O/M) and related with soil contents of NO3--N, NH4+-N, and dissolved organic C (DOC). Over the whole year, soil N2O emissions under CT were similar for grass- and legume-based cropping systems and averaged 0.43 +/- 0.17 kg N ha(-1), while NT exacerbated N2O emissions in the legume-based cropping system (0.80 +/- 0.07 kg N ha(-1) in V/M versus -0.07 +/- 0.06 kg N ha(-1) in O/M). Maize yield was not affected by tillage, but increased from 2.32 Mg ha(-1) in O/M to 4.44 Mg ha(-1) in V/M. Yield-scaled N2O emissions varied from -33g N2O-N Mg-1 grain in NT O/M to 179g N2O-N Mg-1 grain in NT VIM, and were intermediate in CT soil (106 and 156 g N2O-N Mg-lgrain in V/M and O/M cropping systems, respectively). In the short-term trial, the N2O emitted in excess relative to the control treatment (O/M without N fertilizer) was at least 3 times greater with urea-N (0.44% of applied N) than with legume-residue-Nsource (0.13% of applied N). Yield-scaled N2O emission after vetch residues management (67 g N Mg-1 grain) was half of that after urea-N application (152 g N Mg-1 grain). Partially supplying the maize N requirements with winter legume cover-crops may be a feasible strategy to mitigate soil N2O emissions in the subtropical conservation agriculture.

AB The objectives of this study were i) to measure the soil N2O fluxes in a cropping system currently adopted by farmers of the region (FP), and in an ecologically intensified cropping system (EI) over two consecutive maize growing seasons (2011-12 and 2012-13), and ii) to relate N2O fluxes to soil factors. Gas fluxes were measured using vented static chambers, from October through April in each season. Fluxes of N2O ranged from 3 to 88 jig N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) in 2011-12, and between 3 and 97 jig N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) in 2012-13. There was a significant (p < 0.05) interaction in N2O fluxes between management systems and sampling dates (p < 0.05) in both seasons. The highest N2O fluxes were observed often following a precipitation event and shortly after N fertilization. While management system impacted on maize grain yield, it had no significant (p < 0.05) effect on cumulative N2O emissions, which were, on average across two seasons, 558 g N2O-N ha(-1) for the EI treatment and 578 g N2O-N ha(-1) for the FP treatment. Cumulative N2O emissions tended to be 20% greater over 153 days in 2012-13 compared with over 156 days in 2011-12 mainly due to differences in total and timing precipitations. As there were no differences in cumulative N2O emissions between managements but grain yield was higher under EI, this treatment had lower yield-based N2O emissions (75 g N2O-N Mg-1 grain) compared with FP treatment (94 g N2O-N Mg-1 grain). The results showed that a moderate increase in N rate (10 kg N ha(-1)), combined with N split-application and UAN (urea-ammonium nitrate) as N source, as well as other crop management practices, can be a viable alternative to improve maize productivity without increasing the N2O environmental impact.

AB Agricultural tillage practices have a significant impact on the generation and consumption of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the primary causes of global warming. Two tillage systems, conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), were compared to evaluate their effects on GHG emissions in this study. Averaged from 2018 to 2020, significant decreases of CO2 and N2O emissions by 7.4% and 51.1% were observed in NT as compared to those of CT. NT was also found to inhibit the soil CH4 uptake. In this study, soil was a source of CO2 and N2O but a sink for CH4. The effect of soil temperature on the fluxes of CO2 was more pronounced than that of soil moisture. However, soil temperature and soil moisture had a weak correlation with CH4 and N2O flux variations. As compared to CT, NT did not affect maize yields but significantly reduced global warming potential (GWP) by 8.07%. For yield-scaled GWP, no significant difference was observed in NT (9.63) and CT (10.71). Taken together, NT was an environment-friendly tillage practice to mitigate GHG emissions in the soil under the tested conditions.

AB An automated system for continuous measurement of N2O fluxes on an hourly basis was employed to study N2O emissions in an intensively managed low carbon calcareous soil under sub-humid temperate monsoon conditions. N2O emissions occurred mainly within two weeks of application of NH4+-based fertilizer and total N2O emissions in wheat (average 0.35 or 0.21 kg N ha(-1) season(-1)) and maize (average 1.47 or 0.49 kg N ha(-1) season(-1)) under conventional and optimum N fertilization (300 and 50-122 kg N ha(-1), respectively) were lower than previously reported from low frequency measurements. Results from closed static chamber showed that N2O was produced mainly from nitrification of NH4+-based fertilizer, with little denitrification occurring due to limited readily oxidizable carbon and low soil moisture despite consistently high soil nitrate-N concentrations. Significant reductions in N2O emissions can be achieved by optimizing fertilizer N rates, using nitrification inhibitors, or changing from NH4+- to NO3--based fertilizers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Alternative irrigation between saline water and groundwater can alleviate shortages of available agricultural water while effectively slowing the adverse effects of saline water on the soil-crop system when compared with continuous irrigation with saline water and blending irrigation between saline water and groundwater. In 2018, we tested the effect on soil CO2 and N2O emissions by two types of irrigation regimes (alternating groundwater and saline water (GW-SW), and alternating groundwater, followed by two cycles of saline water (GW-SW-SW)) between groundwater and three levels of salinity of irrigation water (mineralization of 2 g/L, 3.5 g/L, and 5 g/L), analyzed the correlation between gas emissions and soil properties, calculated comprehensive global warming potential (GWP), and investigated the maize yield. The results show that, with the same alternate irrigation regime, cumulative CO2 emissions decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity, and cumulative N2O emissions increased. Cumulative CO2 emissions were higher in the GW-SW regime for the same irrigation water salinity, and cumulative N2O emissions were higher in the GW-SW-SW regime. The GW-SW-SW regime had less comprehensive GWP and maize yield as compared to the GW-SW regime. The 2 g/L salinity in both regimes showed larger comprehensive GWP and maize yield. The 3.5 g/L salinity under the GW-SW regime will be the best choice while considering that the smaller comprehensive GWP and the larger maize yield are appropriate for agricultural implication. Fertilizer type and irrigation amount can be taken into consideration in future research direction.

AB The emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from agricultural fields are a significant contribution to global warming. Understanding the mechanisms of N 2 O emissions from agricultural fields is essential for the development of N 2 O emission mitigation strategies. Currently, there are extensive studies on N 2 O emissions on the surface of agricultural soils, while studies on N 2 O fluxes at the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zones (ISU) are limited. Uncertainties exist regarding N 2 O emissions from the soil -shallow groundwater systems in agricultural fields. In this study, a three-year lysimeter experiment (2019 - 2020, 2022) was conducted to simulate the soilshallow groundwater systems under four controlled shallow groundwater depth (SGD) (i.e., SGD = 40, 70, 110, and 150 cm) conditions in North China Plain (NCP). Weekly continuous monitoring of N 2 O emissions from soil surface, N 2 O concentration in the shallow groundwater and the upper 10 cm of pores at the ISU, and nitrogen cycling -related parameters in the soil and groundwater was conducted. The results showed that soil surface N 2 O emissions increased with decreased shallow groundwater depth, and the highest emissions of 96.44 kg ha -1 and 104.32 kg ha -1 were observed at G2 (SGD = 40 cm) in 2020 and 2022. During the observation period of one maize growing season, shallow groundwater acted as a sink for the unsaturated zone when the groundwater depth was 40 cm, 70 cm, and 110 cm. However, when SGD was 150 cm, shallow groundwater became a source for the unsaturated zone. After fertilization, the groundwater in all treatment plots behaved as a sink for the unsaturated zone, and the diffusion intensity decreased with increasing SGD. The results would provide a theoretical basis for cropland water management to reduce N 2 O emissions.

AB Increasing nitrogen (N) utilization and reducing N losses are a globally accepted strategy for N fertilizer application. However, little information has been reported on the fate of N when urea (U) and nitrification and/or urease inhibitors are used in black soils. Therefore, a two-year field experiment was conducted with three N fertilizer application treatments, including urea-only, urea combined with nitrification inhibitor (U+NI), urea combined with NI and urease inhibitor (UI) treatments. Maize (Zea mays L.) yield, N use efficiency, gas emissions, global warming potential (GWP), and apparent N loss were determined. Compared to the other treatments, the U+NI+UI treatment had the significantly (P < 0.05) highest maize yield (11.2 t ha-1), N recovery efficiency (44.5%), agronomic N efficiency (28.7 kg kg-1) and N partial factor productivity (75.8 kg kg-1). Moreover, the U+NI+UI treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the peak of Ammonia (NH3) volatilization and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, cumulative NH3 volatilization and N2O emissions, and apparent N loss compared to the U treatment. Although there was no significant difference in cumulative N2O emissions between the U+NI+UI and U+NI treatments, the U+NI+UI treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced cumulative NH3 volatilization by 55.3%, GWP by 16.2%, and apparent N loss by 28.2% compared to the U+NI treatment. Overall, the combination of urea with urease and inhibitors is a good practice to improve maize yield and N use efficiency while reducing environmental impacts in black soil.

AB Extracts of neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) and Gliricidia sepium Jacquin, locally known as 'mata-raton', are used to control pests of maize. Their application, however, is known to affect soil microorganisms. We investigated if these extracts affected emissions of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), important greenhouse gases, and dynamics of soil inorganic N. Soil was treated with extracts of neem, mata-raton or lambda-cyhalothrin, used as chemical control. The soil was amended with or without urea and incubated at 40% and 100% water holding capacity (WHC). Concentrations of ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) and emissions of CH4, CO2 and N2O were monitored for 7 d. Treating urea-amended soil with extracts of neem, mata-raton or lambda-cyhalothrin reduced the emission of CO2 significantly compared to the untreated soil with the largest decrease found in the latter. Oxidation of CH4 was inhibited by extracts of neem in the unamended soil, and by neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin in the urea-amended soil compared to the untreated soil. Neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin reduced the N2O emission from the unamended soil incubated at 40%WHC compared to the untreated soil. Extracts of neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin had no significant effect on dynamics of NH4+, NO2- and NO3-. It was found that emission Of CO2 and oxidation of CH4 was inhibited in the urea-amended soil treated with extracts of neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin, but ammonification, N2O emission and nitrification were not affected.

AB The N losses via denitrification and the N-2/N2O emission ratio are highly uncertain, mainly due to methodological difficulties concerning measurement of N-2 emissions. Here, we report on seasonal measurements of N2O and N-2 emissions from the top soil of a winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping system in the North China Plain. A novel double cylinder soil core method was used to measure N2O and N-2 fluxes in situ from a 20-year field experiment with four N fertilizer treatments (0, 200, 400, and 600kgNha(-1)year(-1)) and 16 sampling occasions over a 1-year period. The N-2-free helium-oxygen atmosphere in the inter-layer between the two cylinders acted as a buffer against N-2 diffusion from the atmosphere into the soil core. Total N2O emissions were 0.44, 1.31, 2.19, and 2.23kgNha(-1)year(-1), and total N-2 emissions were 8.3, 20.0, 22.5, and 24.7kgNha(-1)year(-1) from the N0, N200, N400, and N600 treatments, respectively. The N-2/N2O emission ratio ranged from 2 to 136, indicating that N-2 was the dominant gas. The N-2/N2O ratio was much higher in summer than in winter, and was inversely related to fertilizer N application. Fluxes of N-2 were statistically related to soil temperature and concentrations of NO3--N and DOC in soil extracts, while N2O fluxes were related to soil water content and concentrations of NO3--N and exchangeable NH4+ in soil extracts. The N-2/N2O ratio was related to soil temperature and exchangeable NH4+ and NO3--N concentrations. Our study provides new insights on variations of the N-2/N2O emission ratio in agroecosystems, and shows the importance of seasonal measurements.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O, a potent greenhouse gas; GHG) is emitted at relatively high rates from corn-based agricultural systems. N2O mitigation strategies, in addition to reducing GHG emissions, ideally would not increase other harmful pollutants (such as leached nitrate, NO3, or volatilized ammonia, NH3) or decrease crop yield. We used the Denitrification-Decomposition model (DNDC) to simulate an array of single and combined interventions to corn management across broad range of physical conditions (climate and soil) in the Midwest US. We assumed a typical crop management baseline of continuous corn or corn-soy with conventional tillage and urea-ammonium nitrate fertilizer broadcast to the soil surface. Interventions included fertilizer nitrogen (N) form, controlled-release N, addition of nitrification inhibitors, N rate, split sidedress N applications, sub-soil N placement, and reduced tillage. Single-factor interventions which reduced N2O in all locales included a change to urea fertilizer, nitrification inhibitors, reductions to N rate, and use of N injection: urea fertilizer and nitrification inhibitors both reduced N2O emissions on average (30 and 9%, respectively) while simultaneously reducing NO3 leaching and mostly neutral effects to yield; N rate reductions reduced N2O (11%) but had modest negative effects to yield. Other single-factor interventions increase N2O emissions or N leaching on average but could have beneficial effects under some conditions. Combined interventions frequently include (> 50% of the time) urea, nitrification inhibitors, and reduced N. Interventions that, even when combined with other interventions, do not reduce N2O emissions and N leaching include anhydrous ammonia fertilizer, controlled release, and injection. Controlled-release fertilizer results were contrary to those reported in most field studies indicating that DNDC's simulation of linear N release over time may be too simplistic to replicate field conditions.

AB Water shortage and heavy greenhouse gas emissions are threatening agricultural sustainability with food security severely, and becoming a major issue in arid areas. It is unclear whether improved farming systems on stripintercropping integrated with no-tillage with straw returning and re-using old film practices can be developed to reduce soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and boost crop yields for tackling those issues. A four-year field experiment for wheat-maize intercropping was carried on straw residue and film management of northwestern China in 2014-2017 and aimed to comprehensively assess crop yields and soil N2O emissions. The results showed that NTSMF (no-tillage with straw mulching and re-using old film), NTSSF (no-tillage with straw standing and reusing old film), and CTSF (conventional tillage with straw incorporation and mulching new film every year) treatments increased grain yields by 15.1%, 13.7%, and 12.8% respectively, compared to CTF (conventional tillage with no straw returning and mulching new film every year, the control treatment). NTSMF, NTSSF, and CTSF treatments had greater water use efficiency by 15.7%, 13.1%, and 14.2% than CTF, respectively. On the contrary, NTSMF and NTSSF treatments had lower soil N2O emissions (NE) by 23.9% and 20.4% than CTF, and lower by 19.8% and 16.0% than CTSF, respectively. No-tillage practice used more soil moisture and produced more grain yields but emitted less N2O than conventional tillage, NTSMF and NTSSF treatments reduced soil N2O emission per volume of evapotranspiration (WUENE) by 23.6% and 20.9%, and reduced soil N2O emission intensity (NEI) by 33.9% and 30.0% in comparison to CTF. The better effect on the reduction of NE, WUENE, and SEI was found in NTSMF, and the three indicators were successively decreased by 5.3%, 4.4%, and 6.9% over NTSSF in 2016-2017. NTSMF reduced NE and boosted GY was attributed to increased synchronicity of water demand and reduced adverse effects of soil temperature variations of both intercrops' strips. Our study concluded that grain yields were enhanced and soil N2O emissions were reduced by NTSMF treatment, and NTSMF treatment is a practical cropping production system for environmentally clean in an arid irrigated region.

AB Faced with the great challenge of food demand and environmental pollution, optimizing agricultural practices can potentially balance food security and environmental protection. In this study, the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was applied to explore the effect of wheat-based management strategies on crop productivity and greenhouse gas emissions in the wheat-maize system. The DNDC model was tested against crop yield, daily nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and cumulative N2O emissions determined from field measurements in a typical winter wheat-summer maize cropping system. Model evaluations demonstrated a good agreement between the observations and simulated crop yield (4.4%& nbsp;<= NRMSE <= 8.0%), daily N2O fluxes (0.68 <= d <= 0.88), and cumulative N2O emissions (4.9%<= NRMSE <= 11.9%). By adopting sensitivity analysis, the DNDC model then assessed the impacts on crop yield and cumulative N2O emissions of multiple management practices from the winter wheat season. Delaying the sowing date from October 7 to November 4 reduced annual yield by 1.9%, while cumulative N2O emissions were increased by 10.4%. Furthermore, postponing the supplementary irrigation date from April 1 to May 20 decreased annual yield by 2.4% without affecting cumulative N2O emissions. An N fertilizer rate of 120-150 kg N ha(-1) was able to reduce N usage and cumulative N2O emissions without sacrificing annual yield. Despite an improvement in the annual yield at the 0-30 cm tillage depth by 2.9%, cumulative N2O emissions increased by 11.6%. The results suggest that sowing in early October, applying supplementary irrigation in early April, an N fertilizer rate of 120-150 kg N ha(-1), and no-tillage from the winter wheat season can improve crop yield and mitigate N2O emissions. This is conducive to the synergism of agricultural production and environmental sustainability.

AB National and regional efforts are underway to increase fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa, where attaining food security is a perennial challenge and mean fertilizer use in many countries is < 10 % of nationally recommended rates. Increases in nitrogen (N) inputs will likely cause increased emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). We established experimental plots with different rates of N applied to maize (Zea mays) in a field with a history of nutrient additions in western Kenya and measured N2O fluxes. Fertilizer was applied by hand at 0, 50, 75, 100, and 200 kg N ha(-1) in a split application on March 22 and April 20, 2010. Gas sampling was conducted daily during the week following applications, and was otherwise collected weekly or biweekly until June 29, 2010. Cumulative fluxes were highest from the 200 kg N ha(-1) treatment, with emissions of 810 g N2O-N ha(-1); fluxes from other treatments ranged from 620 to 710 g N2O-N ha(-1), but with no significant differences among treatments. Emissions of N2O during the 99-day measurement period represented < 0.1 % of added fertilizer N for all treatments. Though limited to a single year, these results provide further evidence that African agricultural systems may have N2O emission factors substantially lower than the global mean.

AB Reduced tillage might reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cropped soils. However the topic is somehow still controversial, since lower CO2 emissions achieved through reduced soil mineralization might be offset by higher N2O losses from less disturbed soil, because of higher water filled pore space. This work aimed to clarify the potential GHG mitigation benefits of minimum tillage (MT), as opposed to mouldboard ploughing (CT), for Mediterranean maize cultivations under low water input management. To this end, soil CO2 and N2O fluxes were monitored at high time resolution by means of a newly developed automated system of closed static chambers coupled to a field gas photoacoustic detector. Relative to CT, cumulated CO2 emissions appeared significantly reduced in MT over three months after the autumn ploughing (by about 30%) and along the spring-summer cultivation (by about 28%), for similar maize yields. N2O emissions from MT showed restrained averaged values relative to CT (by 40% and 18% for fallow and maize periods, respectively); however differences might not be significant. For both treatments, N2O emission factors were lower than the 1% IPCC default value (0.40 and 0.28 for CT and MT, respectively), following the restrained irrigation water input along the drought period. Results indicate that MT reduced GHG emissions both (i) in the short-term, likely due to the increased decomposition of soil organic matter in the ploughed soil (CT), mainly concentrated within the first week after deep tillage; (ii) in the longer-term, likely through its capacity to constrain the daily soil temperature fluctuations in the drought periods along the spring-summer maize cultivation. At this stage, the low-water input management might have played a key role in mediating the response of N2O emissions to MT treatment.
   These findings suggest that minimum tillage could entail consistent GHG benefits under the drip irrigation management in Mediterranean croplands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Row-crop agriculture is a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) globally, and results from recent field experiments suggest that significant decreases in N2O emissions may be possible by decreasing nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs without affecting economic return from grain yield. We tested this hypothesis on five commercially farmed fields in Michigan, USA planted with corn in 2007 and 2008. Six rates of N fertilizer (0-225 kg N ha-1) were broadcast and incorporated before planting, as per local practice. Across all sites and years, increases in N2O flux were best described by a nonlinear, exponentially increasing response to increasing N rate. N2O emission factors per unit of N applied ranged from 0.6% to 1.5% and increased with increasing N application across all sites and years, especially at N rates above those required for maximum crop yield. At the two N fertilizer rates above those recommended for maximum economic return (135 kg N ha-1), average N2O fluxes were 43% (18 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1) and 115% (26 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1) higher than were fluxes at the recommended rate, respectively. The maximum return to nitrogen rate of 154 kg N ha-1 yielded an average 8.3 Mg grain ha-1. Our study shows the potential to lower agricultural N2O fluxes within a range of N fertilization that does not affect economic return from grain yield.

AB Biochar application is considered an effective method for reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of various biochar dosages on soil N2O emissions and the duration of one-time biochar application remain unclear. The effects of different biochar application rates and a one-time application on soil N2O emissions in the Huanghuaihai Plain of China were investigated through a field experiment from 2020 to 2022. In the wheat and maize rotation system, six treatments were administered: no biochar (C0); 2 (C1), 4 (C2), 8 (C3), and 12 t/hm(2) biochar (C4) applied annually; and a one-time application of 12 t/hm(2) biochar (CS) in 2018. Our results indicate that, compared with C0, biochar significantly inhibited soil N2O emissions, particularly in the C3 and C4 treatments, with reductions of 31.36-56.21% and 36.92-52.45%, respectively. However, CS did not significantly affect soil N2O emissions during the study period. These findings suggest that the biochar's inhibitory effect on soil N2O emissions is contingent upon the dosage and frequency of application. A structural equation model revealed that biochar decreases soil N2O emissions by enhancing the reduction in N2O during denitrification. Under the conditions of this experiment, based on a logistic ecological model, a one-time application of 12 t/hm(2) biochar was projected to significantly reduce soil N2O emissions for approximately 1.77 years. On the whole, biochar reduces soil N2O emissions mainly by regulating N2O production through denitrification, and the duration of this inhibition of N2O emissions mainly depends on the application amount and frequency of biochar application.

AB The huge excrement quantity from the increasing large-scale livestock stressed the ecological, environmental deterioration. As a major benefit for handling livestock manure, the slurry of biogas (BS) is developed during the production of biogas that might increase plant productivity. However, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from BS are considered a significant danger to the environment due to global warming potential. Furthermore, applying different proportions of BS combined with chemical fertilizer (CF) on N2O productions in the North China Plain (NCP) remains unclear. Herein, two sequential field trials were performed by maize-wheat rotations to substitute the CF by BS and reduce N2O emissions while keeping the crop yield stable. Four treatments were conducted, including T1, T3, T6, and CK. A total of 226.5 kg N ha(-1) used in the maize-wheat rotation system. Additionally, different ratios of BS (100%, 80%, and 50%) combined with CF were used in wheat season in the tillering stage. Results showed integrated applications of BS with CF have potential for reducing N2O emission. Our findings showed that the maximum grain yield of CF was 6250 kg ha(-1), which might be achieved by applying 38% BS and 62% of CF. This ratio yielded 1.03 kg ha(-1) N2O emissions, which was 15% lesser than the N2O emission of CK, 1.21 kg ha(-1). Considering whole growing period of wheat biogas treatments significantly reduced the cumulative N2O emissions from 17% to 26% compared to CF. To achieve maximum yield and minimum N2O emissions, an optimum 38% BS ratio has been suggested. The integrated use of BS and CF provided the greatest grain yield because of necessary nutrients provided by both slurry and CF. Consequently, N2O emissions reduced based on frequency and type of fertilizer. In conclusion, 38% ratio of BS combined with 62% CF would be a suitable approach to mitigate N2O emission and simultaneously increase crop yield in NCP. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hotspots of N2O emissions are generated from legume residues during decomposition. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from co-cultivated intercropped plants may proliferate into the microsites and interact with soil microbes to reduce N2O emissions. Yet, the mechanisms by which or how mycorrhizal hyphae affect nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the legume residues remain ambiguous. Here, a split-microcosm experiment was conducted to assess hyphae of Rhizophagus aggregatus from neighbouring maize on overall N2O emissions from stubbles of nodulated or non-nodulated soybean. Soil microbes from fields intercropped with maize/soybean amended with fertilizer nitrogen (SS-N1) or unamended (SS-N0) were added to the soybean chamber only. AMF hyphae consistently reduced N2O emissions by 20.8%-61.5%. Generally, AMF hyphae promoted the abundance of N2O-consuming (nosZ-type) denitrifiers and altered their community composition. The effects were partly associated with increasing MBC and DOC. By contrast, AMF reduced the abundance of nirK-type denitrifiers in the nodulated SS-N0 treatment only and that of AOB in the non-nodulated SS-N1 treatment. Taken together, our results show that AMF reduced N2O emissions from soybean stubbles, mainly through the promotion of N2O-consuming denitrifiers. This holds promise for mitigating N2O emissions by manipulating the efficacious AMF and their associated microbes in cereal/legume intercropping systems.

AB A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of the continuous application of organic and mineral N fertilizer on N2O and NO emissions under maize and wheat rotation on the North China Plain. This study included eight treatments: no fertilizer (control); mineral N fertilizer (Nmin) at a rate of 200 kg N ha(-1) per season; 50% mineral fertilizer N plus 50% cattle manure N (50% CM), 50% chicken manure N (50% FC) or 50% pig manure N (50% FP); 75% mineral fertilizer N plus 25% cattle manure N (25% CM), 25% chicken manure N (25% FC) or 25% pig manure N (25% FP). The annual N2O and NO emissions were 2.71 and 0.39 kg N ha(-1), respectively, under the Nmin treatment, with an emission factor of 0.50% for N2O and 0.07% for NO. Compared with the Nmin treatment, N2O emissions did not differ when 50% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (50% CM, 50% FC and 50% FP), while annual NO emissions were significantly reduced by 49.0% and 27.8% under 50% FC and 50% FP, respectively. In contrast, annual N2O emissions decreased by 21-38% compared to the Nmin treatment when 25% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP). Most of the reduction occurred during the maize season. The 25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP treatments had no effect on NO emissions compared to the Nmin treatment. There was no obvious difference in annual N2O and NO emissions among the organic manures at the same application rate, probably due to their similar C/N ratio. Replacing a portion of the mineral fertilizer N with organic fertilizer N did not significantly affect crop grain yield, except for the 50% FC treatment in the wheat season. Overall, the results suggest that the combined application of 25% organic manure N plus 75% mineral fertilizer N had the most potential to mitigate N2O emissions while not affecting crop yield in the maize and wheat rotation system in this area of China.

AB An increase in renewable energy and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops is expected in order to meet global greenhouse gas (GHG) targets. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, and this paper addresses a knowledge gap concerning soil N2O emissions over the possible "hot spot" of land use conversion from established pasture to the biofuel crop Miscanthus. The work aims to quantify the impacts of this land use change on N2O fluxes using three different cultivation methods. Three replicates of four treatments were established: Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) planted without tillage; Mxg planted with light tillage; a novel seed-based Miscanthus hybrid planted with light tillage under bio-degradable mulch film; and a control of uncultivated established grass pasture with sheep grazing. Soil N2O fluxes were recorded every 2 weeks using static chambers starting from preconversion in April 2016 and continuing until the end of October 2017. Monthly soil samples were also taken and analysed for nitrate and ammonium. There was no significant difference in N2O emissions between the different cultivation methods. However, in comparison with the uncultivated pasture, N2O emissions from the cultivated Miscanthus plots were 550%-819% higher in the first year (April to December 2016) and 469%-485% higher in the second year (January to October 2017). When added to an estimated carbon cost for production over a 10 year crop lifetime (including crop management, harvest, and transportation), the measured N2O conversion cost of 4.13 Mg CO2-eq./ha represents a 44% increase in emission compared to the base case. This paper clearly shows the need to incorporate N2O fluxes during Miscanthus establishment into assessments of GHG balances and life cycle analysis and provides vital knowledge needed for this process. This work therefore also helps to support policy decisions regarding the costs and benefits of land use change to Miscanthus.

AB Injection of slurry or digestate below maize seeds is a relatively new technique developed to improve nitrogen use efficiency. However, this practice has the major drawback of increasing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The application of a nitrification inhibitor (NI) is an effective method to reduce these emissions. To evaluate the effect of the NI 3,4-dimethypyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on N2O emissions and the stabilization of ammonium, a two-factorial soil-column experiment was conducted. PVC pipes (20 cm diameter and 30 cm length) were used as incubation vessels for the soil-columns. The trial consisted of four treatments in a randomized block design with four replications: slurry injection, slurry injection + DMPP, digestate injection, and digestate injection + DMPP. During the 47-day incubation period, N2O fluxes were measured twice a week and cumulated by linear interpolation of the gas-fluxes of consecutive measurement dates. After completion of the gas flux measurement, concentration of ammonium and nitrate within the soil-columns was determined. DMPP delayed the conversion of ammonium within the manure injection zone significantly. This effect was considerably more pronounced in treatment digestate + NI than in treatment slurry + NI. Regarding the cumulated N2O emissions, no difference between slurry and digestate treatments was determined. DMPP reduced the release of N2O significantly. Transferring the results into practice, the use of DMPP is a promising way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and nitrate leaching, following the injection of slurry or digestate.

AB Legume tree-based farming systems sit at a crucial nexus of agroecological sustainability. Their capacity to support microbial N-2 fixation can increase soil nitrogen (N) availability and therefore improve soil fertility, crop yields, and support long-term stewardship of natural resources. However, increasing N availability oftentimes catalyzes the release of N into the surrounding environment, in particular nitrous oxide (N2O) a potent greenhouse gas. We summarize current knowledge on the agroecological footprint of legume-based agroforestry and provide a first appraisal of whether the technology represents a pathway toward sustainable development or an environmental hazard.

AB Nitrogen (N) gas losses can be reduced by using enhanced-efficiency N (EEN) fertilizers such as urease inhibitors and coating technologies. In this work, we assessed the potential ofEENfertilizers to reduce winter losses of nitrous oxide (N2O-N) and ammonia (NH3-N) from a subtropical field experiment on a clayey Inceptisol under no-till in Southern Brazil. TheEENsources used included urea containingN-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (UR+NBPT), polymer-coated urea (P-CU) and copper-and-boron-coated urea (CuB-CU) in addition to common urea (UR) and a control treatment without N fertilizer application. N2O-N andNH(3)-N losses were assessed by using the static chamber method and semi-open static collectors, respectively. Both N2O-N andNH(3)-N exhibited two large peaks with an intervening period of low soil moisture and air temperature. Although the short-term effect was limited to the first few days after application,UR +NBPTurea decreased soil N2O-N emissions by 38% relative toUR. In contrast, urease inhibitor technology had no effect onNH(3)-N volatilization. Both coating technologies (CuB-CUand P-CU) were ineffective in reducing N losses via N2O production orNH(3)volatilization. The N2O emission factor (% N applied released as N2O) was unaffected by all N sources and amounted to only 0.48% of N applied-roughly one-half the default factor ofIPCCTier 1 (1%). Based on our findings, usingNBPT-treated urea in the cold winter season in subtropical agroecosystems provides environmental benefits in the form of reduced soil N2O emissions; however, fertilizer coating technologies provide no agronomic (NH3) or environmental (N2O) advantages.

AB Accurate evaluation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from legume<bold>-</bold>based intercropping is key to supporting the agricultural green transition. However, current methods often ignore the direct emissions from the interspecific interaction row of legume/cereal intercropping. Here, a two-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the difference between direct measurement and theoretical estimation of N2O emissions and soil respiration from maize/peanut and maize/soybean strip intercropping. Results showed that theoretical estimation overestimated the N2O emissions from interaction row by 12 - 15 % compared to direct measurement (P < 0.05). This overestimation occurred mainly during the N2O emissions peak (lasting 5 - 7 days) after topdressing N fertilization, which accounted for 21 - 49 % of the overestimation. Soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations in the interaction row were 33 - 129 % and 26 - 96 % lower than the weighted average of the crop rows following topdressing N fertilization (P < 0.05). However, the soil respiration of the interaction row did not differ between direct measurement and theoretical estimation, which may indicate N is the key interaction elements for intercropped legume and cereal rather than carbon. Furthermore, the uncertainty in theoretical estimation of N2O emissions from legume-based intercropping was increases with the decrease of strip width, which mainly due to the increasing contribution of interaction zone. In conclusion, theoretical estimation can lead to an overestimation of N2O emissions, underscoring the necessity for direct measurement, especially as strip width narrows with increased proportion of interspecific interactions zones.

AB Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) move through agroecosystem in coupled biogeochemical cycles and increasing C stocks in soils and vegetation has an influence on the N cycle. This paper reports how the soil organic carbon (Cox) affects nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emission from arable soils in agricultural regions of Slovakia. A process-based model DNDC (denitrification-decomposition model) was used in this study to quantify N(2)O emission under the diverse climate, soil, and crop rotation conditions across the four agroregions in Slovakia. Soil organic carbon content differs in the agroregions. The highest average Cox content is in mountainous agricultural region then in potato agroregion, maize agroregion and the lowest is in sugar beet agricultural region. Simulated N(2)O emissions correlated with the Cox content in these agroregions with the highest N(2)O emissions in Mountainous agricultural region and the lowest in Sugar beet agricultural region.

AB Abating large losses of nitrogen (N) oxides while maintaining or enhancing crop yield is a major goal in irrigated maize (Zea mays L) cropping areas. During two consecutive campaigns, the new nitrification inhibitor 2-(3,4-dimethy1-1H-pyrazol-1-y1) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA) applied with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and the same fertilizer applied by drip-fertigation without the inhibitor, were evaluated and compared with CAN broadcast to the surface and irrigated with sprinklers. Concurrently, urea-based treatments such as urea-fertigation and the broadcast application of urea combined with sprinkler irrigation, with or without the urease inhibitor N-butyl thiophosphorictriamide (NBPT), were also assessed. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes, grain and biomass yield and yield scaled N2O emissions of the different treatments were compared. Additionally, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured. On average, fertigation treatments led to a mitigation of N2O emissions with respect to sprinkler irrigation by 80% and 78% for CAN and urea, respectively. With regards to inhibitor-based strategies, the use of DMPSA and NBPT reduced N2O losses by 58% and 51%, respectively, considering the average of both maize cropping seasons. Since no differences in grain yield were observed between fertilized treatments, DMPSA and fertigation treatments gave the lowest values of yield-scaled N2O emissions, leading to reductions of 63%, 71% and 78% for CAN with DMPSA, urea-fertigation and CAN-fertigation, respectively, with respect to conventional management strategies (surface broadcast application and sprinkler irrigation). Low NO emissions during the first campaign masked differences between treatments, whereas during the second season, NO losses significantly decreased in the following order: conventional treatments > inhibitors > fertigation. Comparing conventional management practices, CAN significantly decreased emissions of N oxides compared with urea, but this effect was only observed in the second maize cropping season. The moisture distribution pattern in drip plots (dry and wet areas) caused a reduction of CH4 sink (only in one of the two seasons) and respiration fluxes, in comparison to sprinkler. This study shows that the use of the new nitrification inhibitor DMPSA and drip-fertigation should be promoted in irrigated maize agro-ecosystems, in order to mitigate emissions of N oxides without penalizing grain yield and leading to similar or enhanced biomass production.

AB An integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS), when managed properly, can help in mitigating soil surface greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, the impacts of an ICLS on GHG fluxes are poorly understood. The present study was conducted at two sites (northern Brookings [Brookings-N] and northwestern Brookings [Brookings-NW]) established in 2016 and 2017, respectively, under loamy soils in South Dakota. The specific objective was to evaluate the impact of cover crops (CCs) and grazed CCs under oat (Avena sativa L.)-CCs-maize (Zea mays L.) rotation on GHG fluxes. Study treatments included the following: (a) a legume-dominated CC (LdC), (b) a cattle-grazed LdC (LdC+G), (c) a grass-dominated CC (GdC), (d) a cattle-grazed GdC (GdC+G), and (e) one without CC or grazing (NC). Greenhouse gas monitoring occurred weekly during the growing crop seasons in 2016 and 2017 for Brookings-N and in 2017 and 2018 for Brookings-NW. Data showed that cumulative CO2 and N2O fluxes at Brookings-N were lower for GdC+G (4042 kg C ha(-1) for CO2 and 1499 g N ha(-1) for N2O) than for LdC+G (4819 kg C ha(-1) for CO2 and 2017 g N ha(-1) for N2O), indicating the superiority of GdC+G over LdC+G in reducing GHG fluxes. However, no effect from grazed CC on cumulative CO2 and N2O fluxes were observed at the Brookings-NW site. Cumulative CH4 flux was not affected by an ICLS at either site. This short-term investigation showed that, in general, CCs and grazing of CCs and maize residue did not impact GHG fluxes.

AB Purpose The effects of straw incorporation on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission at the soil aggregate scale have yet to be elucidated, especially with supplemental nitrogen (N) and/or organic carbon (OC). The objective of this study was to evaluate N2O emission across different size soil aggregates of 6-year straw-incorporated soil as affected by exogenous N and OC treatments. Materials and methods In the present study, the N2O emission from different particle size soil aggregates (> 2, 1-2, 0.25-1, and < 0.25 mm) were investigated with/without 6-year maize straw incorporation under protected vegetable production. Ammonium sulfate (100 mg N kg(-1)) or ammonium sulfate (100 mg N kg(-1)) + glucose (100 mg C kg(-1)) were applied to these soil aggregates along with an unamended treatment (Control, CK) and incubated in a robotized continuous on-line incubation system for 200 h at 20celcius and 25% gravimetric water content. The dynamics of N2O emission was conducted in closed bottles with 21% initial oxygen concentration. Results and discussion The results showed that the proportion of > 1 mm aggregates and < 1 mm aggregates in straw-incorporated soil were increased 10.2% and decreased 29.1%, respectively, than those in no straw-incorporated soil. For all investigated treatments, < 0.25 mm aggregates had the highest cumulative N2O emission with 2.15-45.1 nmol N g(-1) across all aggregate sizes. Cumulative N2O emission in < 0.25 mm aggregate of straw-incorporated soil was greater than that in no straw-incorporated soil without exogenous N and OC addition. N addition stimulated N2O emission from all size aggregates, and the N-stimulating effects were enhanced by the simultaneous addition of glucose. With exogenous N, N, and OC additions, cumulative N2O emission in > 2 mm, 1-2 mm, and 0.25-1 mm aggregates of straw-incorporated soil was greater than that in no straw-incorporated soil. Conclusions These results suggested that the characteristic of N2O emissions across different size aggregates from straw-incorporated soil is altered with supplemental N and OC. The study highlights that the N2O emission from straw-incorporated soil was stimulated by exogenous organic carbon and nitrogen addition within > 0.25 mm aggregate.

AB Urea is the most widely used N fertilizer due to its high N concentration (46%), cost effectiveness and ease of handling. However, urea is susceptible to loss as N2O, a greenhouse gas and catalyst of stratospheric ozone decline. Polymer-coated fertilizers may be effective in reducing such losses but the appropriate coating thickness for effective field performance is unknown. We prepared urea granules with polyurethane coating (PCU) based on castor oil at 2%-8% by weight. We tested the fertilizer value of these materials for maize (Zea mays L.) and measured field loss of N2O. Maize grain yield and N uptake were similar in treatments fertilized with urea (uncoated) and each of the coated materials. Cumulative N2O-N per unit of grain yield, however, was reduced by 80% with PCU8% compared with uncoated urea. Results indicate that polyurethane-coated urea performs similarly to uncoated urea for maize production while reducing soil N2O emissions up to 60-80%, with an efficiency factor twice as high as that suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for N fertilizers. Our results indicate that urea with a polyurethane coating of 8% (PCU8%) had the best combined agronomic and environmental performance in a field study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Japan, most cows are fed indoors, so cow manure must be carefully treated and used to manage soil fertility. The objective of this study was to compare the net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance (NGHGB) of Italian ryegrass - corn (maize) double-cropping fields receiving farmyard manure (FYM), slurry, or methane fermentation digestion liquid (MFDL). FYM, Slurry, MFDL, mineral fertilizer only (Fen.), and no-N control (Cont.) plots were set up in a randomized block design (n = 3). FYM, slurry, or MFDL was applied to meet the K requirement for forage production, and then mineral fertilizers were supplemented to meet the N and P requirements. From September 2017 to September 2020, C inputs as manure and crop residue, heterotrophic respiration (R-H), and emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from soil were determined. The similarity of the total yields in FYM, Slurry, MFDL, and Fert. plots reflected judicious fertility management. However, the residue-C input of Italian ryegrass was 38% greater in FYM plots than in the other plots. Manure-C input decreased in the order of FYM > Slurry > MFDL plots. R-H was greater in FYM and Slurry plots than in MFDL plots. Net ecosystem C balance (NECB) ([residue-C + manure-C] - [R-H-C + CH4-C]) decreased in the order of FYM > Slurry > MFDL plots. N2O emission was greater in Slurry and MFDL plots than in FYM plots. Consequently, NGHGB ([CH4 and N2O emissions] - NECB) in terms of CO2 equivalent decreased in the order of MFDL > Slurry > FYM plots, so FYM application contributed most to GHG mitigation. Yield-scaled NGHGB was smallest in FYM plots owing to the synergy of the greatest residue-C and manure-C inputs, less N2O emission, and the achievement of a high enough yield, reflecting judicious fertility management based on manure and mineral fertilizer.

AB Over the last 50 years, the most increase in cultivated land area globally has been due to a doubling of irrigated land. Long-term agronomic management impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and global warming potential (GWP) in irrigated systems, however, remain relatively unknown. Here, residue and tillage management effects were quantified by measuring soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes and SOC changes (Delta SOC) at a long-term, irrigated continuous corn (Zea mays L.) system in eastern Nebraska, United States. Management treatments began in 2002, and measured treatments included no or high stover removal (0 or 6.8 Mg DM ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) under no-till (NT) or conventional disk tillage (CT) with full irrigation (n = 4). Soil N2O and CH4 fluxes were measured for five crop-years (2011-2015), and Delta SOC was determined on an equivalent mass basis to similar to 30 cm soil depth. Both area-and yield-scaled soil N2O emissions were greater with stover retention compared to removal and for CT compared to NT, with no interaction between stover and tillage practices. Methane comprised <1% of total emissions, with NT being CH4 neutral and CT a CH4 source. Surface SOC decreased with stover removal and with CT after 14 years of management. When Delta SOC, soil GHG emissions, and agronomic energy usage were used to calculate system GWP, all management systems were net GHG sources. Conservation practices (NT, stover retention) each decreased system GWP compared to conventional practices (CT, stover removal), but pairing conservation practices conferred no additional mitigation benefit. Although cropping system, management equipment/timing/history, soil type, location, weather, and the depth to which Delta SOC is measured affect the GWP outcomes of irrigated systems at large, this long-term irrigated study provides valuable empirical evidence of how management decisions can impact soil GHG emissions and surface SOC stocks.

AB Organic fertilizers have great potential to improve crop production while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agroecosystems. To study their effect on GHG emissions, a field experiment over a two-year period (2021 and 2022) was carried out to quantify carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Experimental treatments included: (i) two types of organic fertilizers [wheat residue (WR) and sheep manure (SM)]; and (ii) three cropping systems [monocropping of maize (Zea mays L., Ma) and mung bean (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek, Mu), and their intercropping (Ma + Mu)]. Total crop biomass and its carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, soil CO2 and N2O emissions, soil temperature and moisture were measured. The results showed that Ma + Mu_WR significantly reduced cumulative CO2 emissions by 36% and 28% compared to the Ma_WR and Mu_WR, respectively. Similarly, Ma + Mu_SM reduced soil CO2 emissions by 38% and 70% compared to Ma_SM and Mu_SM, respectively. In addition, Ma + Mu_WR had 69% and 71% lower cumulative N2O emissions than Ma_WR and Mu_WR, respectively, while Ma + Mu_SM showed 48% and 55% lower emissions than Ma_SM and Mu_SM, respectively. WR application significantly increased C input and the C input/output. In the Mu, WR fertilizer led to a significant reduction in both C output and total C emitted, whereas in Ma + Mu, these parameters were not affected by the type of organic fertilizers. In Ma, C output was higher under WR than SM, but total C emitted remained unaffected. This study suggests that integrating organic fertilizer into an intercropping system provides a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to effective GHG mitigation.

AB Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerdardii Vitman) are potential bioenergy feedstocks. Perennial grasses managed as bioenergy feedstock require nitrogenous inputs, which can cause N2O emission and, thereby, alter their effectiveness to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Few studies have measured N2O emission from perennial grasses managed as feedstock. The objectives of this study were to compare N2O flux and soil organic C (SOC) storage between (i) grasses with legume companion crops or with nitrogenous fertilizer, (ii) two grass harvest times (autumn and spring), and (iii) perennial systems and corn (Zea maize L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (C-S) rotation, all without tillage. Nitrous oxide flux was measured from May 2009 to May 2012, and SOC was measured in 2000, 2006, and 2011. Big bluestem-clover (Dalea) and switchgrass-clover treatments had dramatically reduced annual N2O emissions and yield-scaled emissions compared with the respective grasses with urea fertilizer. Cumulative N2O emission was 14 to 40% greater in the big bluestem-spring and switchgrass-spring treatments compared with respective autumn-harvested treatments. The average cumulative emission in fertilized big bluestem and switchgrass treatments (18.5 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) exceeded that of the C-S rotation (12.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1)). The emission factor (EF) for fertilized grasses averaged 2.5%, corn averaged 1.05%, and C-S rotation averaged 1.9%. The SOC storage by perennial grasses was limited to 0 to 5 cm and thus may not be adequate to offset N2O emission. Nitrogen management refinement is recommended for herbaceous perennials to optimize biomass production and minimize N2O emission.

AB In the hilly areas of southern China, uplands and paddies are located adjacent to each other. Using rice straw as mulch for upland soil may improve crop production and partially replace chemical fertilizers, which may mitigate N2O emissions. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the potential of rice straw mulching for mitigating N2O emissions and increasing crop production. The treatments included no mulching (CK), 5000 kg ha(-1) of straw mulching (SM5), and 10,000 kg ha(-1) of straw mulching (SM10). Moreover, all the treatments received equivalent amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium from chemical fertilizers plus rice straw. Relative to CK, cumulative N2O emissions decreased by 23.1 and 33.5% with SM5 and SM10, respectively. Significant positive correlations were observed between N2O fluxes and soil water-filled pore space (WPFS) (r (2) = 0.495, P < 0.05) and between seasonal cumulative N2O fluxes and the chemical N fertilization rate (r (2) = 0.814, P < 0.05). These findings indicate that soil WPFS was the key environmental factor in N2O emissions and that the substitution of chemical nitrogen fertilizer with rice straw was the main driver of N2O mitigation. Relative to CK, the maize yield increased by 16.5 and 29.6% with SM5 and SM10, respectively, which can be attributed primarily to the increases in soil moisture. The chemical fertilizer input could be decreased and N2O emissions could be mitigated through straw mulching, while achieving improved crop yield. This management strategy has great potential, and this study provides an important reference for low-carbon agriculture.

AB Efforts have been made in recent years to improve knowledge about soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from sub-Saharan Africa. However, data on soil GHG emissions from smallholder coffee-dairy systems have not hitherto been measured experimentally. This study aimed to quantify soil GHG emissions at different spatial and temporal scales in smallholder coffee-dairy farms in Murang'a County, Central Kenya. GHG measurements were carried out for one year, comprising two cropping seasons, using vented static chambers and gas chromatography. Sixty rectangular frames were installed on two farms comprising the three main cropping systems found in the area: 1) coffee (Coffea arabica L.); 2) Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum); and 3) maize intercropped with beans (Zea mays and Phaseolus vulgaris). Within these fields, chambers were allocated on fertilised and unfertilised locations to capture spatial variability. Cumulative annual fluxes in coffee plots ranged from 1 to 1.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1), 6.5 to 7.6 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) and (-)3.4 to -2.2 kg CH4 -C ha(-1), with 66% to 94% of annual GHG fluxes occurring during rainy seasons. Across the farm plots, coffee received most of the N inputs and had 56% to 89% higher emissions of N2O than Napier grass, maize and beans. Within farm plots, two to six times higher emissions were found in fertilised hotspots - around the perimeter of coffee trees or within planted maize rows - than in unfertilised locations between trees, rows and planting holes. Background and induced soil N2O emissions from fertiliser and manure applications in the three cropping systems were lower than hypothesized from previous studies and empirical models. This study supplements methods and underlying data for the quantification of GHG emissions at multiple spatial and temporal scales in tropical, smallholder farming systems. Advances towards overcoming the dearth of data will facilitate the understanding of synergies and tradeoffs of climate-smart approaches for low emissions development. (c) 2018 The Authors.

AB Biochar has been proven to have great potential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and improving crop growth. However, the effects of biochar addition on yield-scaled N2O emissions in a mulched and drip-irrigated maize field using different irrigation water qualities and quantities remain unclear. A two-year field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of biochar addition, irrigation level and water salinity on soil N2O emis-sions, maize yield and grain N uptake in Northwest China. Eight treatments in total included the combination of two biochar addition rates of 0 t/ha (B0) and 60 t/ha (B1), two irrigation levels of full (W1) and deficit irrigation (W2, W2 = 1/2 W1) and two water salinity levels of freshwater (S0, 0.71 g/L) and brackish water (S1, 4 g/L). The soil properties, N2O emission fluxes, maize yield and grain N uptake, along with the abundances of N-cycle functional marker genes were measured during the two growing seasons. Soil water-filled pore space (WFPS), soil NH4+-N and NO3--N contents accounted for the majority of the variation in the dynamic changes of N2O fluxes. Deficit irrigation had lower N2O emissions compared with full irrigation, which was more pronounced in the second year. Relative to freshwater irrigation, brackish water irrigation increased N2O emissions under W1, but freshwater and brackish water irrigation had similar N2O emissions under W2 in both years. Biochar addition effectively mitigated N2O emissions by 29.4-31.0% and 17.9-29.2% under different irrigation treatments in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The continuous drought induced by deficit irrigation weakened the effectiveness of biochar in reducing N2O emissions. The differences in N-cycle functional marker genes could not reflect the variation in cumulative N2O emissions among treatments. Under all irrigation treatments excluding W2S1, biochar addition improved the total maize yield and grain N uptake over the two-year period by 4.06-10.74% and 5.57-8.63%, respectively. Brackish water and deficit irrigation increased grain and grain N yield-scaled N2O emissions, whereas biochar addition reduced both of them. Overall, these findings suggest that biochar addition can effectively reduce N2O emissions and increase yield and grain N uptake under brackish water and deficit drip irrigation with mulching in a maize field system, and thus adding biochar can help with achieving the sus-tainability of agricultural production in areas with limited freshwater resources.

AB [1] The rotation of crops with fast-growing tree, shrub, and herbaceous N-2-fixing legume species ( improved fallows) is a central agroforestry technology for soil fertility management in the humid tropics. Maize yields are increased following improved fallows compared with continuous maize cropping or traditional natural-fallow systems consisting of broadleaved weeds and grasses. However, the effect of these improved-fallow systems on N availability and N2O emissions following residue application has yet to be determined. Emissions from these systems not only have a detrimental effect on the environment, but are of additional concern in that they represent a potentially significant loss of N and a reduction in N-use efficiency. Emissions of N2O were measured from improved-fallow agroforestry systems in western Kenya, being characteristic of agroforestry systems in the humid tropics. Emissions were increased after incorporation of fallow residues and were higher after incorporation of improved-fallow legume residues (Sesbania sesban, Crotalaria grahamiana, Macroptilium atropurpureum) than natural-fallow residues ( mainly consisting of Digitaria abyssibica, Habiscus cannabinus, Bidens pilosa, Guizotia scabra, Leonotis nepetifolia, Commelina benghalensis). Following incorporation of Sesbania and Macroptilium residues (7.4 t dry matter ha(-1); 2.9% N) in a mixed fallow system, 4.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1) was emitted over 84 days. The percentages of N applied emitted as N2O following residue incorporation in these tropical agroforestry systems were of the same magnitude as in temperate agricultural systems. N2O (log(e)) emissions were positively correlated with residue N content (r = 0.93; P < 0.05), and thus the residue composition, particularly its N content, is an important consideration when proposing management practices to mitigate N2O emissions from these systems.

AB The need for improved herbage yield and forage quality, on intensively managed grassland, in dairy fanning systems, often results in land being brought into tillage, either by grassland reseeding or conversion to arable cropping (particularly maize (Zea mays L,) for silage). However, both options are likely to increase the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) after grassland cultivation, particularly when this involves ploughing, although there is limited information about the level of emissions. In order to estimate whether the time of ploughing and type of forage crop would affect the annual emissions of the important GHG nitrous oxide (N2O) in the year after soil disturbance of grassland, a field experiment was established on a Eutric Luvisol in northern Germany. The three factorial experiment comprised the effect of land use management (four treatments: ploughing and reseeding in autumn; ploughing and reseeding in spring, ploughing and conversion to maize in spring; control treatment of intact permanent grassland); the effect of nitrogen (N) fertilizer input (two treatments: 0 and 240 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) applied as cattle slurry); and the experimental year (two years). Treatments were arranged with three replicates in a randomized block design. N2O emissions were measured on a weekly basis with the static chamber method and N drainage during winter was estimated using suction cups. Thus, direct and indirect N2O emissions (via N leaching) were calculated per ha as well as per unit of forage yield. Results showed that ground-frost and freeze-thaw cycles were major drivers of enhanced N2O fluxes during the winter following ploughing and reseeding of grassland in autumn, resulting in the highest direct emissions of 21.31 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1). Emissions following, grassland ploughing in spring were mainly driven by high soil mineral N concentrations but with maximum figures of 3.90 and 6.32 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) after reseeding and conversion to maize respectively. Emissions in the intact permanent grassland were lowest in both years. Forage yield related emissions were also highest for grassland ploughing and reseeding in autumn and lowest for intact permanent grassland, but with no significant differences for reseeding and maize cultivation after grassland ploughing in spring. Application of slurry increased annual N2O emissions, particularly when applied in the year of reseeding, but with a lower calculated emission factor as advised by the IPCC guidelines for N fertilizers. We conclude that sustaining highly productive permanent grass-clover swards with moderate N fertilization and without tillage is the best option for 'climate-smart forage production' followed, when unavoidable, by tillage operations only in early spring for direct grassland reseeding, or delayed reseeding using a high yielding forage crop like maize.

AB Agricultural soils form the backbone of the country's economic development. The increased population has not only reduced this treasure but also has affected the global climate at an alarming rate. Among the GHGs, emission of N2O due to agricultural activities is nowadays a global concern. Agricultural industries have increased N2O and CH(4)by 17% in the atmosphere since 1990, with an average emanation rate of around 60 MT CO(2)equivalents per year. Crop production accounts for approximately 50% of N2O emissions stemming from the farming community and discharges of fertilizer-induced N2O, for the time being estimated by IPCC at 1.24% of the N used ranging from 0.76% (rice) to 2.77% (maize). The concentration of atmospheric N2O has increased (60 ppb) after the industrial revolution, at the pace of 0.73 ppb year(-1). Besides, soil structure, temperature, moisture, denitrifying microbial population, pH, C:N ratio, and relief are the factors which significantly enhance the N2O levels into the atmosphere. N2O as a GHG has more potential towards global warming than CO(2)and has a very long residence period (115 years) in the atmosphere. N2O emission is nowadays a core issue which needs to be mitigated so as to decline the levels of its production in agricultural soils. However, priority should be given to the organic farming, management of soil chemistry, and phytoremediation to reduce the addition of N2O into the ambient air. Furthermore, deployment of N2O reductase in agricultural soils increases the efficiency of converting N2O to inert N(2)which is a valuable strategy to reduce N2O production.

AB Knowledge about the impacts of the application of organic amendments such as straw and biochar to dryland agricultural soils with respect to soil properties, crop production, soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gases emissions is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of straw and straw:derived biochar amendments on soil properties, net global warming potential (NGWP) and net greenhouse gas intensity (NGHGI). A field experiment extending over two years was conducted involving simultaneous measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil organic carbon (SOC) content in a wheat-maize crop rotation on the Loess Plateau of China. There were five treatments: control with no amendment (CK); conventional chemical fertilizer only (F); 8 t ha(-1) wheat straw plus fertilizer (FS); 8 t ha(-1) straw derived biochar plus fertilizer (FBlow); and 16 t ha(-1) straw derived biochar plus fertilizer (FBhigh). SOC, C:N ratio and high active organic carbon (HAC) increased by 26.4%, 30.8% and 17.1%, respectively in the FBhigh treatment relative to the FS treatment. As compared to the F treatment, addition of straw significantly increased the total soil organic carbon sequestration rate (TSOCSR) in the soil depth of 0-100 cm and CO2 emissions, but had no significant effect on soil N2O and CH4 emissions or crop yield. However, straw-derived biochar amendment significantly decreased N2O emissions while significantly increasing (p <0.05) crop yield and TSOCSR, but there was no effect on soil CO2 emissions. Over all, our result showed an overall reduction in NGWP of 37.8% and 31.5% and in NGHGI of 28.1% and 21.2% under straw derived biochar amendment at 8 t ha(-1) and 16 t ha(-1), respectively as compared to the straw amendment. Thus, amending the soil with straw-derived biochar could provide a mechanism to lower the greenhouse gas intensity while increasing the productivity of wheat and maize cropping system in the Loess Plateau of China.

AB Cropping of maize (Zea mays L.) on sandy soil in wet climates involves a significant risk for nitrogen (N) losses, since nitrate added in fertilizers or produced from residues and manure may be lost outside the period with active crop N uptake. This one-year lysimeter experiment investigated the potential of Vizura (R), a formulation for liquid manure (slurry) with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3-) leaching from a coarse sandy soil cropped with maize. Maize followed grass-clover (Lolium perenne L.-Trifolium pratense L.) with spring incorporation and was fertilised with cattle slurry. A total of 12 treatments in triplicate were included in a factorial experiment with 1 m(2) large and 1.4 m deep lysimeters: 1) with or without spraying the above-ground biomass of grass-clover with DMPP before incorporation; 2) application of cattle manure with or without DMPP, or no fertilization; and 3) natural rainfall or extra rain events to represent wet spring conditions, which were simulated with an automated and programmable irrigation system. Around 20 kg N ha(-1) was returned to the soil in grass-clover above-ground biomass, and 145 kg N ha(-1) in cattle manure. Cumulative annual N2O emissions ranged from 0.4 to 1.3 kg N ha(-1), with between 49 and 86% of emissions occurring during spring, Manure application increased N2O emissions, while extra rainfall had no effect. The mitigation of N2O emissions by DMPP ranged from 46 to 67% under natural, and from 44 to 48% under high rainfall conditions. Total annual NO3- leaching ranged from 65 to 162 kg N ha(-1). The extent of NO3- leaching to 1.4 m depth during spring was low, and instead most (72-83%) of total annual NO3--N leaching was recorded during autumn before harvest. The extra rainfall during spring increased NO3--N leaching in the pre-harvest period, but it is not clear to what extent this was associated with the N in grass-clover residues or manure applied in spring, or from N mineralisation below the root zone. Despite evidence for a reduction of NO3- leaching in three of four scenarios, overall this effect was not significant. No DMPP was detected in leachates. In conclusion, DMPP significantly reduced N2O emissions from cattle manure on this sandy loam soil independent of rainfall, while there was no significant effect on NO3- leaching. The results indicate that N2O emissions and NO3--N leaching were partly derived from below-ground sources of N not affected by DMPP, which should be further investigated to better predict the mitigation potential of nitrification inhibitors.

AB NO and NO emissions from an Andisol maize field were studied. The experimental treatments were incorporation of urea into the plough layer at 250 kg N ha(-1) by two applications (U1250), band application of urea at a depth of 8 cm at 75 kg N ha(-1) plus incorporation of urea into the plough layer at 75 kg N ha(-1) (UB150), band application of polyolefin-coated urea at a depth of 5 cm at 150 kg N ha(-1) (CB150), and a control (without N application). N2O fluxes from U1250 and UB 150 peaked following the incorporation of supplementary fertilizer, and declined to the background level after that, while the NO flux from CB 150 was relatively low but remained at constant level until shortly after harvest. Accordingly, the total N2O emissions during the whole cultivation period from the three treatments were not significantly different. The fertilizer-derived N2O-N losses from U1250, UB150 and CB150 were 0.15%, 0.27% and 0.28% of the applied N, respectively. However, it was suggested that, due to the low plant N recovery, U1250 had a significantly larger potential for indirect N2O emission than the other treatments. On the other hand, NO emissions from U1250 and UB 150 were 12 times higher than that from CB 150, and the fertilizer-derived NO-N losses from the three treatments were 0.16%, 0.27% and 0.026% of the applied N, respectively. Significant NO fluxes were detected only when urea-N fertilizer was surface-applied and incorporated into plough-layer soil.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a gas of environmental concern that can be emitted during nitrification and denitrification. Molecular nitrogen (N-2) is the ultimate product of denitrification. The emission of both gases represents an economic loss. This study quantified daily and seasonal N2O and N-2 emissions from three benchmark arable soils sown with maize (Zea mays L.) in Catalonia (northeast Spain) during the irrigation season, and identified the major factors and processes determining these emissions. The N2O was sampled using the closed chamber method, and N-2 from N2O that accumulated with the acetylene inhibition method, simultaneously in the field. At mater-filled pore space (WFPS) >70%, losses amounted to 389 g of N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) from the El Pinell site, 144 g of N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) from the Barbens site, and 125 g of N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) from the Bellpuig site. Most of the N was lost through complete denitrification. Up to 640 g of N-2-N ha(-1) d(-1) were lost from the El Pinell site, 1438 g of N-2-N ha(-1) d(-1) from the Barbens site, and 233 g of N-2-N ha(-1) d(-1) from the Bellpuig site. Negative N2O and N-2 fluxes were found. Total (N2O + N-2)-N losses represent 13.6% of the N applied at the El Pinell site, 8.6% at the Barbens site, and 1.7% at the Bellpuig site. Denitrification was the main source of emission. Significant N2O-N losses due to nitrification were also measured. The potential for gaseous N losses from these soils at <40% WFPS is low (it averaged 0.01 g of N ha(-1) d(-1) from the three sites).

AB Conservation tillage is expected to have a positive effect on soil physical properties, soil Carbon (C) storage, while reducing fuel, labour and machinery costs. However, reduced tillage could increase soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and offset the expected gains from increased C sequestration. To date, conservation tillage is barely practiced or studied in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH). Here, we report a field study on the short-term effects of reduced (RT) and no tillage (NT) on N2O emission dynamics, yield-scaled N2O emissions, soil structure and the economics of cereal production, as compared with conventional tillage (CT). The field experiment was conducted in the Sarajevo region on a clayey loam under typical climatic conditions for humid, continental BH. N2O emissions were monitored in a Maize-Barley rotation over two cropping seasons. Soil structure was studied at the end of the second season. In the much wetter 2014, N2O emission were in the order of CT > RT > NT, while in the drier 2015, the order was RT > CT > NT. The emission factors were within or slightly above the uncertainty range of the IPCC Tier 1 factor, if taking account for the N input from the cover crop (alfalfa) preceding the first experimental year. Saturated soils in spring, formation of soil crusts and occasional droughts adversely affected yields, particularly in the second year (barley). In 2014, yield-scaled N2O emissions ranged from 83.2 to 161.7 g N Mg-1 grain (corn) but were much greater in the second year due to crop failure (barley). RT had the smallest yield-scaled N2O emission in both years. NT resulted in economically inacceptable returns, due to the increased costs of weed control and low yields in both years. The reduced number of operations in RT reduced production costs and generated positive net returns. Therefore, RT could potentially provide agronomic and environmental benefits in crop production in BH.

AB A field study was established in 1959 to evaluate the effects of fertilization and crop rotation on crop yields, soil and environmental quality on a Brookston clay loam. There were two fertilizer treatments (fertilized and not-fertilized) and six cropping treatments including continuous corn (CC), continuous Kentucky bluegrass sod and a 4-yr rotation of corn-oat-alfalfa-alfalfa with each phase present each year. We measured N2O emissions, inorganic N and plant N uptake over three growing seasons (2007-2009) in the corn phase. Nitrous oxide emissions varied over the 3 yr as a result of the seasonal variation in precipitation quantity, intensity and timing and differences in crop growth and N uptake. Fertilized CC lost, on average, 7.36 kg N ha(-1) by N2O emissions, whereas the not-fertilized CC lost only 0.51 kg N ha(-1). Fertilized rotation corn (RC) lost 6.46 kg N ha(-1), which was 12% lower than fertilized CC. The not-fertilized RC, on the other hand, emitted about half as much N2O (2.95 kg N ha(-1)) as the fertilized RC. Fertilized RC had corn grain yields that averaged 10.0 t ha(-1) over the 3 yr followed by fertilized CC at 5.48 t ha(-1). Not-fertilized RC corn had yields that were 61% lower (3.93 t ha(-1)) than fertilized RC, whereas the not-fertilized CC had yields that were 75% lower (1.39 t ha(-1)) than fertilized CC. Nitrous oxide emissions were found to be dramatically affected by long-term management practices and crop rotation had lower emissions in the corn phase of the rotation even though the N input from fertilizer addition and legume N fixation was greater. These N2O emission and yield results were due to both factors that are traditionally used to describe these processes as well as long-term soil quality factors, which were created by the long-term management (i.e., soil organic carbon, soil physical parameters such as bulk density, and porosity, soil fauna and microflora) and that influenced crop growth, N uptake and soil water contents.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was measured weekly over a period of one year (1994) on a grassland, a maize field and a permanent pasture. Therefore, the closed box method was used. To estimate the total (N2O+N-2) loss, also soil cores were taken for incubation in the presence of acetylene.
   N2O fluxes were highest in the grazed grassland (11.9 kg N.(-1).435 day(-1)) because of the high nitrogen input (fertilization, deposition of urine and dung by cattle), a higher soil compaction and relatively high moisture content. N2O losses out of the temporary grassland (3.35 kg N.ha(-1).312 day(-1)) and maize field (2.7 kg N.ha(-1).312 days(-1)) were significantly lower. This is attributed to a lower N input and the fact that these 2 fields were very well managed (controlled fertilization, good drainage system, lower compaction,...).
   From an agronomic point of view, N-losses as N2O are small and not important to take into consideration. Besides, these small N2O fluxes can have a negative influence on the environment.
