AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) emissions from an agricultural field in the North China Plain were compared for three treatments during a whole maize growing period from 26 June to 11 October, 2012. Compared with the control treatment (without fertilization, designated as CK), remarkable pulse emissions of N2O, NO and NH3 were observed from the normal fertilization treatment (designated as NP) just after fertilization, whereas only N2O and NH3 pulse emissions were evident from the nitrification inhibitor treatment (designated as ND). The reduction proportions of N2O and NO emissions from the ND treatment compared to those from the NP treatment during the whole maize growing period were 31% and 100%, respectively. A measurable increase of NH3 emission from the ND treatment was found with a cumulative NH3 emission of 3.8 +/- 1.2 kg N/ha, which was 1.4 times greater than that from the NP treatment (2.7 +/- 0.7 kg N/ha).

AB Agricultural soil has been recognized as a major source of atmospheric NO and N2O emissions which have important impacts on regional and global environments. Here we comparably investigated the effects of ammonium, nitrate fertilizers and nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) addition on NO and N2O emissions from the agricultural soil in the North China Plain (NCP). Compared with the ammonium fertilizer application, the reductions of NO emissions caused by nitrate fertilizer and DCD addition were 100% and 93%, and of N2O emissions were 54% and 74%, respectively. Remarkable reductions of NO and N2O emissions were also observed from five different agricultural soils in the NCP by replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer, indicating that nitrification is the predominant process for the emissions of NO and N2O from the soils in the vast area of NCP. NO emission peaks were found to be several days later than N2O peaks after the application of ammonium fertilizer and flooding irrigation, implying that most of NO initially produced via nitrification process might be fast reduced to N2O under the high soil moisture condition. Interestingly, the relative contribution of denitrification to N2O emission showed obviously time-dependent, e.g., evident N2O emission caused by the application of nitrate was only observed after the basal fertilization for the maize and the top dressing for the wheat. Replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer and mixing with the nitrification inhibitor are verified to be effective measures for mitigating NO and N2O emissions from arable soils in the NCP.

AB NO2- plays a crucial role in regulating N2O formation from the soil, while how it affects the production of soil N2O is still not well understood. In this study, N2O and NO emissions from an agricultural field of the North China Plain (NCP) were comparatively investigated under live different fertilizer treatments (NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+ + NO2- and NO3- + NO2-). Additionally, soil NH4+, NO2- and NO3- concentrations and the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen cycling were also analyzed in the incubation experiment. The results showed that the N2O average fluxes from the complex treatments of NO2- + NO3- were 1.4-2.4 times the sum of those from the separate treatments of NO2- and NO3- whereas from the complex treatments of NO2- + NH4+ were a factor of 1 - 1.4 larger than those from the separate treatments of NO(2)( )(-)and NH4+, indicating the coupling interaction of NO2- with NH4+ or NO3- makes a remarkable contribution to N2O emission from the soil. Significant reduction of the activity of N2O reductase was found in the soil with the addition of NO2-, which favored the accumulation of N2O formed through nitrification of NH4+ and denitrification of NO2-, resulting in relatively high N2O emissions from the complex treatments. As the intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification, NO2- produced is also expected to interact with NH(4)( )(+)or NO3- to promote N2O emission from the soil, especially during fertilization events when NO2- is easily accumulated due to the acceleration of the nitrification and denitrification processes.

AB Nitrogen amendment followed by flooding irrigation is a general management practice fora wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain, which may favor nitrification and denitrification. Consequently, high emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are hypothesized to occur. To test this hypothesis, we performed year-round field measurements of N2O and NO fluxes from irrigated wheat-maize fields on a calcareous soil applied with all crop residues using a static, opaque chamber measuring system. To interpret the field data, laboratory experiments using intact soil cores with added carbon (glucose) and nitrogen (nitrate, ammonium) substrates were performed. Our field measurements showed that pulse emissions after fertilization and irrigation/rainfall contributed to 73% and 88% of the annual N2O and NO emissions, respectively. Soil moisture and mineral nitrogen contents significantly affected the emissions of both gases. Annual emissions from fields fertilized at the conventional rate (600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) totaled 4.0 +/- 0.2 and 3.0 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively, while those from unfertilized fields were much lower (0.5 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.4 +/- 0.05 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Direct emission factors (EF(d)s) of N2O and NO for the fertilizer nitrogen were estimated to be 0.59 +/- 0.04% and 0.44 +/- 0.04%, respectively. By summarizing the results of our study and others, we recommended specific EF(d)s (N2O: 0.54 +/- 0.09%; NO: 0.45 +/- 0.04%) for estimating emissions from irrigated croplands on calcareous soils with organic carbon ranging from 5 to 16 g kg(-1). Nitrification dominated the processes driving the emissions of both gases following fertilization. It was evident that insufficient available carbon limited microbial denitrification and thus N2O emission. This implicates that efforts to enhance carbon sink in calcareous soils likely increase their N2O emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The emission of NO was parameterized using empirical relationships with landuse type, fertilization rate and soil temperature. Eight landuse types (including four arable lands) were considered. Fertilization rates were distinguished for different regions and crops. A typical summer period of July in 1999 was chosen for detailed calculations. The total NO emission in the July is 141.1 Gg N, with 73.7% from arable lands and 22.0% from grasslands. The highest emission intensity can be more than 40 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in the heavily fertilized North China Plain, and the average of the whole lands is 6.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1). The annual emission was roughly estimated to be 657 Gg N, about 11.7% of the global total (5600 Gg N, reported by IPCC in 2000), and about 12.5% of the anthropogenic origin in China. Our results were compared with some earlier findings, and uncertainties were discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Straw return in combination with synthetic N fertilizer is considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield. Such practice, however, can considerably modify soil microbial activity and relative C and N availability, both of which are known to regulate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Minimizing these emissions per unit of crop yield is a prerequisite to minimize the environmental footprint of agricultural production and thus, a policy objective. In our study, we quantified N2O and NO emissions and determined fertilizer-N use efficiencies (NUE) and crop yields of two double-cropping (summer maize/Welsh onion-winter wheat) systems with and without straw incorporation in the North China Plain. Relative to the fertilized treatment without straw amendments, straw incorporation showed a significant inhibitory effect on annual N2O emissions from the maize-wheat system (-31%), but no significant effect was observed for the Welsh onion-wheat system. However, straw return significantly reduced annual NO emissions by >30% for both systems. Meanwhile, straw return in both systems significantly increased the NUE and crop yields by 34-47% and 7-16%, respectively, as compared to the treatment without straw additions. Across the double-cropping systems, annual direct emission factors of N2O, NO and N2O + NO were 0.37-0.57%, 0.08-0.78% and 0.57-1.36%, respectively. Furthermore, a negative relationship between direct emission factors of N2O + NO and crop NUE was observed, highlighting the importance of optimizing NUE for reducing environmental risks of a cropping system. When expressing emissions on a yield basis, straw return significantly reduced annual yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions by 15-42% for both systems. Overall, our results show that the combined application of crop straw and synthetic N fertilizer is a promising N management strategy for maximizing crop yields while mitigating N-trace gas emissions.

AB Soil nitrogen dioxide (NOX = NO2 + NO) emissions have been measured and estimated to be the second most significant contributor to the NOX burden following the fossil fuel combustion source globally. NOX emissions from croplands are subject to being underestimated or overlooked in air pollution simulations of regional atmospheric chemistry models. With constraints of ground and space observations of NO2, the WRF-Chem model is used to investigate the cropland NOX emission and its contribution to the near-surface ozone (O-3) pollution in North China Plain (NCP) during a growing season as a case study. Model simulations have revealed that the cropland NOX emissions are underestimated by around 80% without constraints of satellite measured NO2 column densities. The biogenic NOX source is estimated to account for half of the anthropogenic NOX emissions in the NCP during the growing season. Additionally, the cropland NOX source contributes around 5.0% of the maximum daily average 8h O-3 concentration and 27.7% of NO2 concentration in the NCP. Our results suggest the agriculture NOX emission exerts non-negligible impacts on the summertime air quality and needs to be considered when designing emission abatement strategies.

AB Fertilized agricultural soil is a significant source of gaseous nitrogen compounds (GNCs), including N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3. The North China Plain (NCP) is the "hot region" for the release of these GNCs due to intensive fertilization practices. However, existing research has primarily focused on N2O emissions from fertilized farmland in the NCP, lacking comprehensive observational studies on other GNCs. Therefore, a continuous cumulative sampling technique (open-top dynamic chamber system) was utilized in this study to simultaneously measure the exchange fluxes of N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3 over summer maize-winter wheat rotation fields in the NCP. Results showed that GNC emissions from the soil displayed distinct diurnal variations, with higher emissions during the day attributed to elevated soil temperature. However, N2O emissions remained consistent between day and night, potentially influenced not only by soil temperature but also by soil humidity. Annual cumulative emissions and emission factors (EFs) for four GNCs were determined, indicating that N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions during the maize season were 1.38-2.37 times higher than those during the wheat season, with 98 % of HONO emissions occurring in the maize season. Additionally, the study first presented the annual HONO EFs of 0.36 +/- 0.03 % in fertilized farmland. Furthermore, a comparison revealed that the fluxes of N2O, NO, NH3, and HONO using the conventional single-point sampling method were 26.4 %, 13.9 %, and 8.10 % lower, and 7.86 % higher compared to the continuous cumulative sampling method recommended in this study. In general, this study provided precise measurements of GNC emissions from farmland, offering essential foundational data for modeling parameters and contributing to the formulation of regional air pollution prevention and control policies.

AB N2O and NO emissions, the water usage and grain yields of a maize field in the North China Plain (NCP) under traditional flood irrigation, drip irrigation and drip fertigation were compared. With respect to the flood irrigation treatment, N2O emissions were reduced by 13.8% in the drip irrigation treatment and 7.7% in the drip fertigation treatment. NO emissions were reduced to 16.7% in the drip irrigation treatment but increased by 21.7% in the drip fertigation treatment. The molar ratios of NO/N2O within 2 days after each fertilization event were evidently greater from the drip fertigation treatment than from the flood irrigation treatment, indicating that nitrification was more intensive in the drip fertigation treatment than in the treatment of flood irrigation. Compared with the flood irrigation treatment, evident increase of the maize yields in the drip irrigation treatment (28%) and the drip fertigation treatment (3.7%) were found. Although the drip fertigation treatment could evidently increase NO emission, the 40% water reduction in drip fertigation is of great importance for the sustainable development of agriculture in the NCP where water resources are extremely limited. To mitigate NO emissions from agricultural fields in the NCP with drip fertigation, the addition of a nitrification inhibitor combined with N or nitrate fertilizer was recommended.

AB Atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has shown periodic conspicuous pulses in the tropospheric column in March over the North China Plain during the past two decades. However, these repetitive pulses have never been reported, and their underlying causes remain unclear. Here, we present robust evidence to demonstrate that agricultural fertilization drives the early spring NO2 column increase. The fertilization-driven soil NOx (= NO+NO2) emissions, comparable to anthropogenic sources, exert complicated influences on regional air quality. They significantly reduce nocturnal and diurnal O3 concentrations in agricultural areas in early spring, distinct from the scenarios in summer, but increase fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations via strongly enhancing nitrate aerosol formation. The impact also extends to urban areas, approximately half that of agricultural areas. These findings have increasing implications for coordinated control of PM2.5 and O3 under global warming. We thus suggest that reducing NOx emissions in croplands is essential to achieve better air quality in agricultural countries and regions.

AB There is a high spatial variation in N2O emission from agricultural fields and N2O emissions from fields cultivated with stalk-crops was generally measured in the interrow area. The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in seasonal N2O emissions between interrow soil and interrow + row soil, and to understand the effect of different fertilizers on N2O emissions in a maize-cultivated sandy loam soil in the North China Plain. The experiment included five treatments: organic manure (OM), half-organic manure N plus half fertilizer N (HOM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NK (NK) and control (CK). Cumulative N2O emission from interrow + row soil during the maize growth season was 0.84-122 kg N ha(-1) with an average of 0.98 kg N ha(-1) in the N-fertilized treatments, significantly higher than the 0.30-0.49 kg N ha(-1) from interrow soil. However, no significant difference was observed in the CK treatment. The measurement in interrow soil underestimated N2O emissions by 44-67%. This difference mainly occurred at the two peak emission periods following fertilizer application probably due to discrepancy in soil denitrification potential. Manure application more efficiently increased difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil than inorganic N fertilizer application. The higher NO concentration did not induce larger N2O emission from interrow soil in the NK treatment than in the NPK treatment, but did from interrow + row soil, resulting in greater difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil. It is suggested that measuring N2O emission solely from interrow soil could underestimate seasonal N2O emissions, and partly mask the effect of N fertilizer application rates on N2O emission in a maize-cultivated soil in the North China Plain.

AB N2O and NO emissions from a winter wheat-summer maize rotation field in the North China Plain were comparably investigated under three different treatments: 1) flood irrigation (A-Flood treatment) plus fertilization of NH4Cl, 2) drip fertigation (A-Drip treatment) plus fertilization of NH4Cl and 3) drip fertigation (AN-Drip treatment) plus fertilization of a mixture of Ca(NO3)(2) and NH4Cl. The annual N2O cumulative emissions from the A-Drip treatment and the A-Flood treatment were almost identical, whereas it from the AN-Drip treatment was significantly lower (33%) than that from the A-Flood treatment. Compared with the A-Flood treatment, the annual NO cumulative emission from the A-Drip treatment was significantly increased by 140% but it from the AN-Drip treatment was only slightly increased by 14%. Compared with drip fertigation with NH4Cl, drip fertigation with the mixture of Ca(NO3)(2) and NH4Cl significantly reduced the cumulative emissions of N2O (31%) and NO (52%) from the nitrification dominated fields by decreasing the supplement of NH4+ substrate. Among the three fertilization treatments, the yields of the maize from the A-Drip and AN-Drip treatments were significantly increased, while the yields of the wheat were almost the same. Considering the benefit of increasing yields and reducing N fertilizer and water input, the application of nitrate-based fertilizer instead of partial ammonium-based fertilizer through drip fertigation could be a promising method for keeping agronomic productivity and environmental sustainability.

AB The exchange fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) from a maize field with three different treatments were simultaneously measured using static and dynamic chambers in the North China Plain (NCP) from June 28 to October 11, 2009. The three treatments included control plot (CK, without crop, fertilization and irrigation), fertilizer N plot (NP) and wheat straw returning plus fertilizer N plot (SN). N-fertilizer application greatly stimulated the emissions of N2O, NOx and NH3, with durations of about 10 days for N2O and NO, and about 7 days for NH3. Fertilizer loss rates were 1.08% (NP plot) and 1.20% (SN plot) as N2O-N, were 1.93% (NP plot) and 0.76% (SN plot) as NO-N, and were 5.24% (NP plot) and 3.03% (SN plot) as NH3-N. In comparison with the NP plot, the significant low fertilizer loss rates as NO-N and NH3-N from the SN plot indicated that the wheat straw returning to the field could reduce NOx and NH3 emissions. The molar ratio of NO/N2O was greater than unity for most data during the pulse emission periods induced by fertilization, and thus, nitrification was the dominant process for N2O and NO emissions during these periods. Considering the significant amount (>80%) of N2O and NOx emissions occurred during the pulse emission periods, the emissions of NOx and N2O from the investigated field were mainly ascribed to nitrification process.

AB The application of nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural fields can lead to the release of nitrogen-containing gases (NCGs), such as NOx , NH3 and N2 O, which can significantly impact regional atmospheric environment and contribute to global climate change. However, there remain considerable research gaps in the accurate measurement of NCGs emissions from agricultural fields, hindering the development of effective emission reduction strategies. We improved an open-top dynamic chambers (OTDCs) system and evaluated the performance by comparing the measured and given fluxes of the NCGs. The results showed that the measured fluxes of NO, N2 O and NH3 were 1 %, 2 % and 7 % lower than the given fluxes, respectively. For the determination of NH3 concentration, we employed a stripping coil-ion chromatograph (SC-IC) analytical technique, which demonstrated an absorption efficiency for atmospheric NH3 exceeding 96.1 % across sampling durations of 6 to 60 min. In the summer maize season, we utilized the OTDCs system to measure the exchange fluxes of NO, NH3 , and N2 O from the soil in the North China Plain. Substantial emissions of NO, NH3 and N2 O were recorded following fertilization, with peaks of 107, 309, 1239 ng N/(m2 <middle dot>s), respectively. Notably, significant NCGs emissions were observed following sustained heavy rainfall one month after fertilization, particularly with NH3 peak being 4.5 times higher than that observed immediately after fertilization. Our results demonstrate that the OTDCs system accurately reflects the emission characteristics of soil NCGs and meets the requirements for long-term and continuous flux observation.

AB High nitrogen (N) inputs in Chinese vegetable and cereal productions played key roles in increasing crop yields. However, emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO) increased too. For lowering the environmental costs of crop production, it is essential to optimize N strategies to maintain high crop productivity, while reducing the associated N losses. We performed a 2 year-round field study regarding the effect of different combinations of poultry manure and chemical N fertilizers on crop yields, N use efficiency (NUE) and N2O and NO fluxes from a Welsh onion-winter wheat system in the North China Plain. Annual N2O and NO emissions averaged 1.14-3.82 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 5.54-13.06 g N kg(-1) N uptake) and 0.57-1.87 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 2.78-6.38 g N kg(-1) N uptake) over all treatments, respectively. Both N2O and NO emissions increased linearly with increasing total N inputs, and the mean annual direct emission factors (EFd) were 0.39% for N2O and 0.19% for NO. Interestingly, the EFd for chemical N fertilizers (N2O: 0.42-0.48%; NO: 0.07-0.11%) was significantly lower than for manure N (N2O: 1.35%; NO: 0.76%). Besides, a negative power relationship between yield-scaled N2O, NO or N2O + NO emissions and NUE was observed, suggesting that improving NUE in crop production is crucial for increasing crop yields while decreasing nitrogenous gas release. Compared to the current farmers' fertilization rate, alternative practices with reduced chemical N fertilizers increased NUE and decreased annual N2O + NO emissions substantially, while crop yields remained unaffected. As a result, annual yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions were reduced by > 20%. Our study shows that a reduction of current application rates of chemical N fertilizers by 30-50% does not affect crop productivity, while at the same time N2O and NO emissions would be reduced significantly.

AB N2O and NO emissions from a winter wheat-summer maize rotation field with five different treatments in the North China Plain (NCP) were comparably investigated from 8 October 2014 to 11 October 2015. Compared with the treatments with only flood or drip irrigation, evident emission peaks of N2O and NO from the fertilization treatments with flood irrigation (A-Flood) and with drip fertigation (A-Drip) were observed after each fertilization event, whereas their emissions from the fertilization treatments with nitrification inhibitors under drip fertigation (A + DCD-Drip and A + Nitrapyrin-Drip) were greatly suppressed. The reduction effect of the nitrification inhibitors on N2O and NO emissions was found to be more conspicuous during the maize season than during the wheat season, implying that the soil temperature could play an important role in the reduction effect. Compared with the A-Flood treatment, the annual cumulative emission from the A-Drip treatment reduced by 22% for N2O and increased by 18% for NO, whereas the reductions of N2O and NO from the treatments with nitrification inhibitors could achieve as high as 66% and 95%, respectively. The yields of the maize were significantly greater from the A-Drip and A + Nitrapyrin-Drip treatments than from the A-Flood treatment, and the yields of the wheat were almost same among the treatments of A-Flood, A-Drip and A + DCD-Drip. Considering the yields, the water saving and the reduction of N2O and NO emissions, the application of nitrification inhibitor combined with drip fertigation is recommended in the NCP.

AB Given the common problem of fertilizer overuse, agronomists are calling for a reduction of the high nitrogen dose by 1/3. We carried out a field experiment over two full winter wheat-summer maize rotations in the North China Plain (NCP) to determine whether this degree of nitrogen reduction will significantly reduce the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Three treatments were investigated in the field trial: a control with no nitrogen application, the conventional practice with nitrogen over-application and the optimal practice with a reduced dose of nitrogen by 1/3. Our observations across all treatments over the experimental period reveal significant correlations of the fluxes of either gas with soil temperature and moisture as well as the concentrations of soil ammonium, nitrate and dissolvable organic carbon. There were strong correlations within the functions of the dual Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving apparent activation energy values of 40-97 and 59-92 kJ mol(-1) for N2O and NO fluxes, respectively. Our results provide annual direct emission factors of 0.48-0.96% for N2O and 0.15-0.47% for NO and demonstrate a significant correlation between N2O emission induced by fertilization and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The correlation indicates a significant potential of N2O mitigation via enhancing NUEs. A reduction in the nitrogen dose did not obviously mitigate either the annual NO emission in both rotations or the annual N2O emission in the second one. However, nitrogen reduction significantly decreased the annual total N2O emission by 38% during the first rotation. These inconsistencies in the responses of N2O emission to the reduced nitrogen dose can be attributed to improper fertilization practices, such as broadcasting urea prior to heavy rainfalls or irrigation events during the maize season, which implies a need for further fertilization practice options/techniques in addition to the reduction of nitrogen doses.

AB Although numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of no-tillage on carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural systems, there is still no consensus on the balance between the potential of C sequestration and nitrous oxide (N2O) or nitric oxide (NO) emissions. A no-tillage field experiment in the North China Plain was established in 2006 and the influence of no-tillage on N2O and NO emissions was monitored under an annual wheat-maize cropping system. The study included four treatments: no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) soils amended with N fertilizer at a rate of 225 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and 195 kg N ha(-1) for maize (NTN and CTN) and without N fertilizer (NT0 and CT0). Three years of no-tillage significantly (p < 0.05) increased soil organic C (SOC) content by 12.2% in the 0-5 cm soil layer, possibly due to the surface aggregation of organic C derived from crop roots and exudates, but did not alter SOC pool in the 0-30 an profile. Annual N2O emissions in the NT0 and CT0 treatments were 0.53 and 0.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively, and were significantly (p < 0.05) increased to 0.96 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in CTN and to 1.23 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in NTN. Remarkable differences in N20 emissions between CTN and NTN were observed during the maize growing season. In contrast, NO emissions were not affected by the tillage regimes regardless of N fertilization. The mean ratios of NO/N2O fluxes in N-unfertilized plots were 0.26-0.29 and 1.79-2.11 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, indicating that both NO and N2O were primarily derived from denitrification during the maize growing season and from nitrification under wheat cultivation. Under N-fertilized plots, the ratios increased to 1.44-2.02 and 5.00-6.03 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, with significantly (p < 0.05) lower values in NTN plots than in CTN plots. The N2O emission factors for N applied in the wheat-maize rotation system were 0.16% and 0.09% for NTN and CTN, respectively, which was far lower than the IPCC Tier 1 default value (1.0%), primarily due to the absence of irrigation after fertilization in maize season and low temperature in wheat season. The results suggest that the 3-year no-tillage regime with residue removal did not substantially increase C storage in the 0-30 cm profile, but stimulated N2O emissions primarily by increasing denitrification.

AB Maize (Zea mays L.), a staple crop in the North China Plain, contributing substantially to agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in this region. Many studies have focused on various agricultural management measures to reduce N2O emissions. However, few have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems. In the current study, we investigate whether maize-soybean intercropping treatments could reduce N2O emission rates. Two differently configured maize-soybean intercropping treatments, 2:2 intercropping (two rows of maize and two rows of soybean, 2M2S) and 2:1 intercropping (two rows of maize and one row of soybean, 2M1S), and monocultured maize (M) and soybean (S) treatments were performed using a static chamber method. The results showed no distinct yield advantage for the intercropping systems. The total N2O production from the various treatments was 0.15 +/- 0.04-113.85 +/- 12.75 mu g m(-2) min(-1). The cumulative N2O emission from the M treatment was 16.9 +/- 2.3 kg ha(-1) over the entire growing season (three and a half months), which was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the 2M2S and 2M1S treatments by 36.6% and 32.2%, respectively. Two applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (as urea) at 240 kg N ha(-1) each induced considerable soil N2O fluxes. Short-term N2O emissions (within one week after each of the two N applications) accounted for 74.4%-83.3% of the total emissions. Soil moisture, temperature, and inorganic N were significantly correlated with soil N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.246-0.365, n = 192, P < 0.001). Soil nitrate (NO3-) and moisture decreased in the intercropping treatments during the growing season. These results indicate that maize-soybean intercropping can reduce soil N-2O emissions relative to monocultured maize.

AB Reactive nitrogen gas (Nr) originating from the soil is highly susceptible to the influence of agricultural water and fertilizer management practices, making it a critical gas that can substantially contribute to atmospheric pollution. Understanding the emission patterns of Nr in the surface soil under reclaimed water (RW) irrigation is essential for guiding RW irrigation practices and informing policies aimed at reducing Nr emissions. In this study conducted in Beijing, North China, field sites were selected with different irrigation management strategies and corresponding fertilizer application methods. The two types of irrigation water quality comprised RW irrigation and groundwater (UW) irrigation, whereas the two fertilizer types utilized were calcium ammonium nitrate with a high nitrate nitrogen content and ammonium sulfate with ammonium nitrogen. Nr emissions and concentrations in the soil profile (0-30 cm depth) were monitored throughout key agricultural events, including cultivation, irrigation, fertilization, and harvest, spanning the period from 2020 to 2021. It is observed that RW irrigation effectively reduces cumulative ammonia (NH3) emissions compared to groundwater (UW) treatment. However, it results in increased concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) (12.33%-73.82%) and nitric oxide (NO) (13.74%-36.59%) in the soil within the depth range of 0-30 cm. Of particular importance is the notable increase in the abundance of soil denitrifying and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA-amoA) genes due to RW irrigation, indicating the potential for elevated N2O and NO emissions. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the soil Nr emissions and concentrations are more strongly affected by nitrogen type rather than water quality. Conversely, the inclusion of nitrate has proven to be effective in mitigating N2O and NO emissions in RW-irrigated farmland.

AB A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of the continuous application of organic and mineral N fertilizer on N2O and NO emissions under maize and wheat rotation on the North China Plain. This study included eight treatments: no fertilizer (control); mineral N fertilizer (Nmin) at a rate of 200 kg N ha(-1) per season; 50% mineral fertilizer N plus 50% cattle manure N (50% CM), 50% chicken manure N (50% FC) or 50% pig manure N (50% FP); 75% mineral fertilizer N plus 25% cattle manure N (25% CM), 25% chicken manure N (25% FC) or 25% pig manure N (25% FP). The annual N2O and NO emissions were 2.71 and 0.39 kg N ha(-1), respectively, under the Nmin treatment, with an emission factor of 0.50% for N2O and 0.07% for NO. Compared with the Nmin treatment, N2O emissions did not differ when 50% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (50% CM, 50% FC and 50% FP), while annual NO emissions were significantly reduced by 49.0% and 27.8% under 50% FC and 50% FP, respectively. In contrast, annual N2O emissions decreased by 21-38% compared to the Nmin treatment when 25% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP). Most of the reduction occurred during the maize season. The 25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP treatments had no effect on NO emissions compared to the Nmin treatment. There was no obvious difference in annual N2O and NO emissions among the organic manures at the same application rate, probably due to their similar C/N ratio. Replacing a portion of the mineral fertilizer N with organic fertilizer N did not significantly affect crop grain yield, except for the 50% FC treatment in the wheat season. Overall, the results suggest that the combined application of 25% organic manure N plus 75% mineral fertilizer N had the most potential to mitigate N2O emissions while not affecting crop yield in the maize and wheat rotation system in this area of China.

AB The exchange fluxes of NOx, NH3 and N2O between two typical agricultural fields and the atmosphere were investigated in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and North China Plain (NCP). The average fluxes of NO and NH3 from the wheat field in the YRD were 79 and -5.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1), and from the paddy field were 3.7 and 34.8 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The fertilize-induced emission factors (EFs) as NO-N and NH3-N from the wheat field were 2.3% and 1%, and from the paddy field were 0.09% and 3.5%, respectively. Remarkable yearly variation of N2O emissions from the investigated NCP maize field was observed, with average fluxes of 72.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in 2008 and 30 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in 2009 and with EFs of 3.78% in 2008 and 1.08% in 2009. The average NO and NH3 fluxes from the maize field in 2009 were 36.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and 94.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Based on the molar ratios of NO/N2O, the emissions of NOx and N2O from the maize field were mainly ascribed to nitrification processes. Returning wheat straw back into the maize field could significantly reduce NOx and NH3 emissions.

AB Although nitrogen fertilizer is crucially important for China's crop production, the overuses in the intensive cereal cropping systems of the North China Plain has caused extensive concern for its environmental consequences on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes. To characterize the integration of environmental and agronomic aspects of fertilizer management, we conducted two annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summer maize (Zea mays L.) rotation cycles under five fertilization treatments, including the farmers' conventional practice (CP) amended with synthetic nitrogen, three alternative managements of reduced nitrogen inputs with synthetic fertilizers alone (UA), synthetic fertilizers combined with poultry manure (UA + PM) or controlled-release urea combined with poultry manure (CU + PM), and the control without nitrogen fertilization (CK). The N2O and NO fluxes and direct emission factors varied seasonally and annually. These variations could be interpreted mechanically by a revised "hole-in-the-pipe" model and dual Michaelis-Menten and Arrhenius kinetics. The CM, CP, UA, UA + PM, and CU + PM treatments released N2O at 0.65, 4.64, 3.66, 2.88, and 2.40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, and NO at least 0.42, 2.35, 2.24, 1.30, and 1.18 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The annual direct emission factors of N2O and NO were 0.41-0.67% and 0.18-0.32%, respectively. The three alternative managements decreased both N2O and NO emissions, expressed either on an area basis or relative to grain yield, without sacrificing crop yields compared to CP. However, their mitigation effects on each gas emission were different. The UA treatment reduced only N2O emission, while UA + PM and CU + PM showed significant mitigation effects on both gases as compared to CP or UA. Overall, our results provide insight into environmental aspect of fertilizer management in major cereal crops and suggest that reducing nitrogen input coupled with organic manure incorporation could be beneficial for simultaneously mitigating nitrogen-containing trace gas fluxes and sustaining cereal grain yields.

AB Nitrogen (N) stabilizers such as urease inhibitors (UI) and nitrification inhibitors (NI) are promising tools to mitigate N losses from fertilized soils. To better understand the efficacy of UI and NI, a 2-year field trial was carried out in the North China Plain (NCP) to analyze the impact of UI and NI on NH3 loss and N transformations following urea fertilizer application. Additionally, a laboratory study using an automated continuous-flow incubation system was conducted under controlled conditions, using the same soil, to evaluate the mitigation potential of the N stabilizers on NO, N2O and CO2 emission. The results showed that a novel UI product, Limus (R) (BASF, Germany), containing active ingredients N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) and N-(n-propyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NPPT), limited ammonium formation rate and reduced NH3 loss in both maize (by 85 and 96% for year 1 and 2, respectively) and wheat (by 41 and 64%, for year 1 and 2, respectively) seasons. The 3, 4-dimethypyrazole phosphate (DMPP) amendment significantly retarded nitrate formation rate but the effectiveness was compromised by high ambient temperature; additionally, the NI amendment increased NH3 emission (by 16 and 24% for maize and wheat year 2, respectively). In the laboratory incubation experiment, addition of the UI reduced emissions of NO, N2O and CO2 by 89, 73 and 19%, respectively, while the addition of the NI reduced the respective emissions by 95, 83 and 24% over the 16 d incubation period. These results suggest that N stabilizers can play a significant role in the mitigation of the environmental impacts of intensive agriculture, and, in particular, that the UI amendment may have the better potential to reduce N losses in the climatic and soil conditions of the NCP, and that the NI should be avoided under high ambient temperatures.

AB Gaseous reactive nitrogen (GNr) losses (N2O, NO emissions and NH3 volatilization, etc.) in greenhouse vegetable fields (GVF) have received considerable critical attention. Much uncertainty still exists about GNr losses reduction under increasing vegetables demand and environmental policies in China. An experiment spanning four greenhouse vegetable growing seasons (cucumber and tomato) was conducted in North China Plain (NCP). It included four treatments, i.e., flood irrigation with no urea-N application (FU0), flood irrigation with conventional urea-N application (FUN), drip fertigation with conventional urea-N application (DUN), and drip fertigation with 50% reduction of urea-N application (DRUN). Obvious emission peaks of N2O, NO and NH3 flux were captured in the GVF after each fertilization and irrigation event. For FUN treatment, the mean annual area-scaled emissions of N2O, NO, and NH3 were 11.48, 1.66, and 44.90 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively; and the mean annual yield-scaled emissions of N2O, NO, and NH3 were 181.86, 23.04, and 800.07 g N t-1 yr- 1, respectively. On the mean annual area-scaled and yield-scaled, the N2O emissions were significantly (P < 0.05) lower by 40.1 % and 32.3 %, and the NO emissions were lower by 23.5 % and 28.5 %, but the NH3 volatilization were significantly (P < 0.05) higher by 31.7 % and 49.0 %, respectively, for the DUN treatment than FUN. Also compared with FUN, in DRUN treatment, the mean annual area-scaled N2O emissions, NO emissions and NH3 volatilization were significantly reduced by 46.7 %, 52.4 % and 22.0 %, respectively; and the mean annual yield-scaled N2O emissions, NO emissions and NH3 volatilization were significantly reduced by 40.7 %, 57.1 % and 24.5 %, respectively. Moreover, compared with FUN treatment, DUN and DRUN treatment both alleviated the global temperature potential (GTP) at 20- and 100-year timescales. Overall, compared with conventional water and fertilizer regimes, only changing irrigation mode reduced N2O and NO emissions but increased NH3 volatilization losses in greenhouse cucumber-tomato cultivation system; reducing N application while changing irrigation methods had significant emission reduction effects on N2O, NO and NH3 at both the area-scaled and yield-scaled, and which is an effective water and fertilizer managements for greenhouse cucumber-tomato cultivation system.

AB Biochar application has been reported to effectively mitigate N2O emissions and increase crop yield; however, its long-term residual effects remain largely unknown. A four-year field experiment was designed in the North China Plain (NCP) to evaluate the residual effect of biochar on N2O and NO emissions and crop yield under maize-wheat rotation. The study included five treatments: no N fertilization (Control), N fertilizer application (CN), and N fertilizer plus maize-straw biochar application at 3 (NB3), 6 (NB6) and 12 t ha(-1) (NB12). Biochar amendment had no effect on maize yield during the four-year rotation, but increased maize grain N uptake by 12.9 - 14.1 % and fertilizer N use efficiency by 13.8 % in the fourth year. Meanwhile, NB12 treatment decreased wheat yield by 11.7 - 15.5 % in each year, except the second, while decreased average wheat yield. Biochar application significantly reduced N2O emissions by 31.5 - 42.4 % during the first maize season, and by 6.9 - 21.3 % in the third and fourth years primarily due to reduction in NH4+ availability for nitrification. Furthermore, this mitigation effect was positively related to soil moisture content and decreased with time after biochar application. Cumulative N2O emissions during the four wheat seasons were 0.25 - 0.85 kg N2O-N ha(-1), and only decreased by 8.9 - 9.9 % under biochar amendment in the third and fourth years probably because low soil temperature suppressed N2O production. Biochar addition in the third and fourth years significantly reduced NO emissions by 9.0 - 20.1 % during the maize growing seasons and 10.5 - 19.1 % during the wheat growing seasons, especially under NB6 treatment. The average yield-scaled N2O and NO emissions were lowest in the NB6 treatment during the maize and wheat season. Overall, these findings suggest that 6 t ha(-1) is the optimal biochar application rate for reducing N2O/NO emissions and yield-scaled N2O/NO emission under four-year maize-wheat rotation in the NCP.

AB The gaseous losses of fertilizer nitrogen (N) applied to agroecosystems are a major contributor to a host of environmental problems, inefficient production systems, and decreased N-use efficiency. These losses lead to the wastage of resources, increasing the greenhouse effect and harming human health. The red soil hilly region of Southeast China houses the biggest orchard area of the world, and nitrogen fertilizers are usually heavily applied to the orchard systems in China. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the gaseous losses of the fertilizer N by ammonia (NH3) volatilization and denitrification losses using the venting method and acetylene inhibition method respectively, and to assess the potential environmental risk of NH3 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from this orchard system based on the recent orchard management practices. An experiment was conducted in an Ougan citrus (Citrus reticulata Blanco 'Suavissima') orchard in the red soil hilly region of Southeast China. Three fertilization treatments, including the control (no N fertilizer, CK), poultry manure (at a rate of 6.3 t/ha, OM), and conventional fertilization (OM 6.3 t/ha + chemical fertilizer 393 kg N/ha, CF), were used. In all treatments, the fertilizers were incorporated into the soil after application. The test results, which were continuously determined within one year, indicated that the NH3 volatilization losses accounted for 4.5% of the OM nitrogen (OM-N) and 2.9% of the CF nitrogen (CF-N), whereas the denitrification N losses accounted for 2.1% of the OM-N and 2.9% of the CF-N. Overall, the total gaseous N losses (including NH3 volatilization losses and denitrification N losses) were 5.8% in the CF treatment. A relatively higher N2O flux, accounting for 1.8% of the CF-N, emitted from the CF treatment.

AB Background and aims Greenhouse vegetable production is commonly associated with substantial nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, low nitrogen (N)and irrigation water use efficiency (NUE and IWUE) due to excess N input and frequent flooding irrigation, so it is crucial to develop irrigation and fertilization strategies to alleviate N2O emissions while ensuring vegetable productivity.
   Methods An experiment spanning three crop rotations of cucumber and celery in a greenhouse was conducted in North China Plain (NCP). It included four treatments, i.e., no N fertilizer (CK), farmers' conventional fertilization (FP), conventional fertilization rate with drip fertigation (FPD), and reduced N fertilizer rate with drip fertigation (RFPD).
   Results The mean annual area-scaled, yield-scaled N2O emissions and direct N2O emission factors (EFd) of FP were 36 kg N ha(-1), 175 g N t(-1) and 1.3%, respectively. FPD significantly reduced N2O emissions by over 25% (both in area- and yield-scaled), enhanced IWUE by 37%, and had no significant negative effects on vegetable yield or NUE. RFPD also significantly mitigated both area- and yield-scaled N2O emissions by about 45%, improved IWUE by 40% and NUE by 25%, while maintaining vegetable yield. Quadratic curves were fitted to the boundary points of ln-transformed N2O emissions against soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS), with the maximum N2O losses occurring at 19.5 celcius or 68%. N2O emissions responded to IWUE and NUEs following an exponential (R-2 = 0.71, P < 0.001) and a linear-plateau model (R-2 = 0.67, P < 0.001), respectively.
   Conclusions Drip irrigation with reduced N fertilizer rate is a suitable agronomic practice to simultaneously mitigate N2O emissions and improve both IWUE and NUE while maintaining vegetable yield from typical greenhouse cucumber-celery fields in NCP.

AB Context: Optimized irrigation management plays a pivotal role in wheat production in the North China Plain (NCP). However, there exists limited research on the potential impact of different irrigation regimes on the loss of reactive nitrogen (Nr) and the fate of nitrogen (N) within the wheat-soil system. Objective: Our study involved an irrigation experiment aimed at quantifying nitrogen-reducing (Nr) while tracing the N fate. Our primary objective was to glean insights into improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and reducing N surplus, thereby enhancing crop yields and minimizing environmental risks. Methods: A two-year field experiment involving winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted in the NCP, employing four distinct irrigation management strategies: I0, pre-planting irrigation; I1, pre-planting + jointing irrigation; I2, pre-planting + anthesis irrigation; I3, pre-planting + jointing + anthesis irrigation. Throughout the wheat growth stages, we measured soil NH3 and N2O emissions alongside yield assessments. The Nr loss, N surplus, NUE and Nr footprint were evaluated. Results: Among the components contributing to Nr loss, ammonia (NH3) volatilization was the most significant, accounting for 53.1-58.9%, followed by nitrate (NO3-) leaching (18.9-23.2%), indirect Nr loss (10.9-12.7%), nitric oxide (NO) emission (4.90-6.02%), nitrous oxide (N2O) emission (2.52-3.55%), and ammonium (NH4+) leaching (2.10-2.58%). NH3 emission and Nr loss demonstrated a close association with soil moisture levels influenced by irrigation management. Across all treatments, the primary fate of the N input was N uptake, representing 42.7-59.4%, and N surplus, accounting for 28.4-46.0%. Furthermore, NH3 volatilization, as the leading contributor to total N loss (11.4-12.9% of N input), accounted for 5.70-6.80% of N input. Compared to over-irrigation (I3), the I1 treatment, characterized by supplemental irrigation during the jointing stage, exhibited a remarkable 29.0% (P < 0.05) reduction in N surplus, achieved a higher NUE of 59.4%, and sustained wheat yield, thereby minimizing the Nr footprint. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage effectively mitigates Nr loss and shapes the N fate, resulting in both high NUE and increased wheat yields, while simultaneously reducing the Nr footprint.
