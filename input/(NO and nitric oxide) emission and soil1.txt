AB Denitrification and nitrification processes in soil produce significant amounts of atmospheric N2O and NO. Laboratory experiments were designed to measure N2O and NO emissions from an agricultural soil shortly after manure addition. Nitrous oxide emissions were higher from soil following addition of manure slurries than following addition of composted manure. Emissions of both N2O arid NO were highest between 1 and 4 d after manure addition. Nitrous oxide emission following manure application was the result of both denitrification and nitrification, which occurred simultaneously in soil. Denitrification was a major producer of N2O because both denitrification rates and N2O emission increased dramatically at higher soil-moisture contents and increased manure concentration. Nitric oxide production occurred during nitrification. Nitrous oxide emitted during the 6 d after manure addition ranged from 0.025 to 0.85% of the manure N. Nitric oxide emissions were approximately 0.26% of the amount of added manure N.

AB Fluxes of NO and N2O from sandy loam soils cropped with winter wheat and a clay loam soil under ryegrass, with and without the addition of NH4NO3 fertilizer, were measured using static and dynamic chamber methods. Nitric oxide fluxes ranged from -0.3 (deposition) to 6.9 (emission) ng NO-N m-2s-1. The corresponding N2O flux ranged from 0 to 91 (emission) ng N2O-N m-2 s-1. The NO flux was temperature dependent. Activation energies ranged from 40 to 81 kJ mol-1. Nitric oxide and N2O fluxes increased linearly with soil available nitrogen (NH4+NO3). Emissions of NO and N2O were not detectable from unfertilized ryegrass plots. Instead, nitric oxide was absorbed by the soil and vegetation at a maximum rate of 0.31 ng NO-N m-2 s-1. The aeration state of the soil controlled the relative rates of NO and N2O emission. Nitric oxide was the major gas emitted from well aerated soils, conditions that favour nitrification. The NO/N2O emission ratio was > 100 for the coarse-textured sandy loam soil and the clay loam soil only during low rainfall periods. Nitrous oxide was the major gas emitted from less aerated soils, conditions that allowed denitrification to occur. The NO/N2O emission ratio was < 0.001 for the clay loam soil when rainfall was high and soils were wet. Extrapolation to the U.K. situation showed that agricultural land may account for 2-6% of the total annual NOx emission and for 16-64% of the total annual N2O emission in the U.K.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from three different peat soil sites during 1992-94 were studied. There was no detectable NO emission from a virgin mire. The average emission of NO-N from a drained peat soil site used for grass cultivation was 64 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). On the same field a plot with no grass cover emitted on an average 300 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1). The average emission from a drained and forested mire site was 5.8 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1). Lowering of water table seems to be needed for emissions of NO from peat soils. Cultivation practises increase the emissions of NO more than draining for forestry. Considering their large area in the northern latitudes, organic soils are potential sources of NO among other biogenic sources.

AB Both NO and N2O are produced in soil microbial processes and have importance in atmospheric physics and chemistry. In recent years several studies have shown that N2O emissions from organic soils can be high at low temperatures. However, the effects of low temperature on NO emissions from soil are unknown. We studied in laboratory conditions, using undisturbed soil cores, the emissions of NO and N2O from organic soils at various temperatures, with an emphasis on processes and emissions during soil freezing and thawing periods. We found no soil freezing- or thawing-related emission maxima for NO, while the N2O emissions were higher both during soil freezing and thawing periods. The results suggest that different factors are involved in the regulation of NO and N2O emissions at low temperatures. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of municipal wastewater land application to nitric oxide production and transport in soil was studied through the formulation and conduct of a comprehensive laboratory testing protocol. Nitric oxide (NO) is a precursor in the formation of tropospheric ozone which can directly impact public health and the environment. It is the uncertainty in the NO budget, and its relation to O-3, that motivates the need for measurements and modeling of NO flux from soils. Wastewater-amended soil is potentially one important component of that budget. NO emissions reported here were measured from: a well-characterized unamended soil, water-amended soil, and wastewater-amended soil in the laboratory in a dynamic test chamber. Laboratory results indicate that NO emissions from the selected sandy loam soil ranged from 0.3 to 0.4 ng N m(-2) s(-1) per cm(2) of unamended soil, while water-amended soil emissions ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) per cm(2). NO flux from wastewater-amended soil ranged from 1.0 to 1.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1) per cm(2) of applied soil. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soils are a major source of global nitric oxide (NO) emissions. However, estimates of soil NO emissions have large uncertainties due to limited observations and multifactorial impacts. Here, we mapped global soil NO emissions, integrating 1356 in-situ NO observations from globally distributed sites with high-resolution climate, soil, and management practice data. We then calculated global and national total NO budgets and revealed the contributions of cropland, grassland, and forest to global soil NO emissions at the national level. The results showed that soil NO emissions were explained mainly by N input, water input and soil pH. Total above-soil NO emissions of the three vegetation cover types were 9.4 Tg N year(-1) in 2014, including 5.9 Tg N year(-1) (1.04, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.09-1.99 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) emitted from forest, 1.7 Tg N year(-1) (0.68, 95% CI: 0.10-1.26 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) from grassland, and 1.8 Tg N year(-1) (0.98, 95% CI: 0.42-1.53 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) from cropland. Soil NO emissions in approximately 57% of 213 countries surveyed were dominated by forests. Our results provide updated inventories of global and national soil NO emissions based on robust data-driven models. These estimates are critical to guiding the mitigation of soil NO emissions and can be used in combination with biogeochemical models.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is a reactive gas that plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry by influencing the production and destruction of ozone and thereby the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. NO also contributes by its oxidation products to the formation of acid rain. The major sources of NO in the atmosphere are anthropogenic emissions (from combustion of fossil fuels) and biogenic emission from soils. NO is both produced and consumed in soils as a result of biotic and abiotic processes. The main processes involved are microbial nitrification and denitrification, and chemodenitrification. Thus, the net result is complex and dependent on several factors such as nitrogen availability, organic matter content, oxygen status, soil moisture, pH and temperature. This paper reviews recent knowledge on processes forming NO in soils and the factors controlling its emission to the atmosphere. Schemes for simulating these processes are described, and the results are discussed with the purpose of scaling up to global emission.

AB In Japan, upland soils are an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) gas emissions. This paper reports on an investigation of the effect of soil moisture near saturation on N2O and NO emission rates from four upland soils in Japan of contrasting texture. The aim was to relate these effects to soil physical properties. Intact cores of each soil type were incubated in the laboratory at different moisture tensions after fertilisation with NH4-N, NO3-N or zero N. Emissions of N2O and NO were measured regularly over a 16-20 day period. At the end of the incubation, soil cores were analysed for physical properties. Moisture and N fertiliser significantly affected rates of emissions of both N2O and NO with large differences between the soil types. Nitrous oxide emissions were greatest in the finer-textured soils, whereas NO emissions were greater in the coarser-textured soils. Emissions of N2O increased at higher moisture contents in all soils, but the magnitude of increase was much greater in finer-textured soils. Nitric oxide emissions were only significant in soils fertilised with NH4-N and were negatively correlated with soil moisture. Analysis of soil properties showed that there was a strong relationship between the magnitude of emissions and soil physical properties. The importance of soil wetness to gas emissions was mainly through its influence on soil air-filled porosity, which itself was related to gas diffusivity. From the results of this research, we can now estimate likely effects of soil texture on emissions through the influence of soil type on soil aeration and soil drainage. This is of particular value in modelling N2O and NO emissions from soil moisture status and land use inputs.

AB To determine the relationship between nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emission rates and soil properties in forest soils, N2O and NO emission rates in soils were measured in incubation experiments under standardized temperature and water conditions (water content at a water-holding capacity of 60%) using soils packed into a cylindrical core, and variations in the soil properties were also determined. The N2O emission rates from nitrification and from denitrification were determined separately using a nitrification inhibitor (10 Pa acetylene). Soil samples were taken from 25 forest stands in a central temperate area of Japan. The N2O and NO emission rates were highly variable, even under the standardized temperature and water-holding capacity (60%) conditions. According to a partial least squared regression model analysis, the C:N ratio and pH strongly affected the N2O emission rate, whereas NO3, water-soluble Al and the C:N ratio strongly affected the NO emission rate. The C:N ratio negatively affected the emission rate of both N oxide gases, suggesting that N mineralization is an important factor in the rates of N oxide gas emission. The acetylene inhibition experiment showed that N2O emission from denitrification was positively affected by pH, water-filled pore space and filling density, and negatively affected by the C:N ratio, total carbon and total nitrogen.

AB An inventory of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions for Europe was developed. The emission of NO was parameterized using empirical relationships with type of landuse, fertilization rate of agricultural areas and soil temperature. For the year 1994, it was estimated that annual soil NO emissions in the inventoried area amounted to 535 kt NO-N yr(-1), i.e. 8% of the emissions from combustion processes. On a hot summer day, this fraction increased to 27%. The uncertainty of these emission estimates, however, is high. They are accurate only within a factor of three to four. As the major fraction (in summer 81%) of the emissions came from arable land, soil NO emissions have to be considered as largely anthropogenic. Large regional differences existed in the soil NO emission rates with the highest emission rates found in southern and western Europe, intermediate rates in eastern Europe and the lowest rates in Scandinavia and northern Russia. The effect of the soil NO emissions on the photochemical formation of ozone (O-3) was investigated with a one-dimensional photochemical model. When soil NO emissions were considered in the model simulations, computed mean daily maximum O-3 concentrations over Europe from June to August 1994 were 4 ppb (uncertainty range: 1.4-9.6 ppb) higher than without these emissions. Reductions of pyrogenic NOx emissions were less efficient in reducing O-3 concentrations when soil NO emissions were taken into account. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Soil N dynamics and water content are important controls of nitrous (N2O) and nitric (NO) oxide emissions from tropical soils. We used a chronosequence of one forest and six pastures to investigate how soil N availability and soil moisture content affect emissions of N2O and NO. Forest soils had high N availability and large N oxide emissions. Forest conversion to pasture decreased N availability and N oxide emissions. In the forest where N availability was high, seasonal changes in soils moisture led to higher N2O fluxes during the wet season, but higher NO fluxes during the dry season. Soil water content exerted the largest control on N2O emissions, which seemed to be determined by a threshold value of approximately 29-30%, below which N2O emissions were nearly constant and above which they increased (Figure 5a). In pastures, where low N availability constrains N2O and NO fluxes, soil water content has a minor influence on N oxide emissions.

AB Emissions of nitric oxide from the soil to the lower troposphere under varying environmental conditions are considered. NO is a precursor in the formation of tropospheric ozone which can directly impact public health and the environment. Understanding and controlling of NO flux from soils to the troposphere can thus be advantageous, protecting air quality as well as conserving valued nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural settings. Comprehensive laboratory protocols have been developed, conducted, and published that consider the influence of mineral fertilizer, municipal wastewater, municipal wastewater treatment biosolids, swine waste, and toluene on NO emissions with varying soil temperature, moisture content, and pH. Laboratory results indicate that NO emissions from wastewater-amended soil have the highest mean emission rate (63 ng-N/m(2)s) followed by toluene-amended soil (47 ng-N/m(2)s), biosolid-amended soil (46 ng-N/m(2)s), mineral fertilizer-amended soil (44 ng-N/m(2)s), and then swine waste-amended soil (4 ngN/m(2)s). Results suggest that emissions of NO from soil are an important source of tropospheric NO that further must be considered in soil and air pollution control, research, and policy determinations.

AB Aim Agroforestry systems incorporating N-fixing trees have been shown to be socially beneficial and are thought to be environmentally friendly, both enriching and stabilizing soil. However, the effect of such systems on the emissions of the important greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and the tropospheric ozone precursor nitric oxide (NO) is largely unknown.
   Location Soil was collected from the research plots of Institut Senegalais de Recherches Agricoles at Bandia and Bambey, Senegal, West Africa, and from neighbouring farmers' fields. Trace gas flux measurements and chemical analysis of the soil were carried out at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), Edinburgh, UK.
   Methods Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were measured following simulated rainfall events (10 and 20 mm equivalents) from repacked soil cores collected under two tree species (Acacia raddiana) and Eucalyptus camaldulensis) in each of two provenance trails. In addition, soil samples were collected in local fields growing peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and Sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), close to the species trials in Bambey. NO was measured using a flow through system and was analysed by chemiluminescence. Nitrous oxide was measured from the repacked soil core headspace and was analysed by electron capture gas chromatography. Soil mineral N was extracted with KCl and analysed by colorimetric methods on separate soil columns.
   Results Light rainfall, which increased the gravimetric soil moisture content to 20%, stimulated an increase in NO emission but there was no detectable N2O emission. A heavy rainfall event, which increased the gravimetric soil moisture to 30%, stimulated N2O emission with a subsequent peak in NO emissions when the soils became drier. Soil collected under the N-fixing tree species emitted significantly more N2O than soil collected under the N-fixing crop species (P < 0.01). NO and N2O emissions significantly correlated with soil available N (NH4 and NO3) (P < 0.05).
   Main Conclusion Rainfall intensity, supply of mineral N from organic matter and N fixation were the prime drivers of NO and N2O emissions from seasonally dry tropical soils. The improved soil fertility underneath the trees provided a larger pool of mineral N and yielded larger rates of NO and N2O emissions.

ID NITRIC-OXIDE EMISSIONS
AB Nitric oxide (NO) is an important air pollutant which leads to the production of ozone and acidic precipitation. Biogenic emissions of NO are gaining in importance for ozone formation in semi-urban and rural regions of the Southeast United States. Using a dynamic chamber system interfaced to a mobile laboratory for continuous NO analysis, soil emissions of NO were measured over typical row crops in North Carolina during 1994 - 1996. This paper investigates the effect of soil temperature, soil water content and soil extractable nitrogen on soil NO emissions from corn and soybean canopies. Three of five sets of measurements from corn and two of four sets of measurements from soybean displayed an exponential relationship between soil NO emissions and soil temperature. No significant correlation between soil NO emissions and water filled pore space (WFPS) was observed. The best correlation observed between soil NO emissions and total extractable nitrogen (TEN) was found to be linear for soybean (NO emission = 0.67 + 1.43*TEN, R-2 = 0.34), and logarithmic for corn (NO emission = 21.20*Ln (TEN) - 27.27, R-2 = 0.17). Multiple regression models (Ln (NO emission) = 1.5017 + 0.0786*TEN - 0.0006*TEN2; R-2 = 0.58 for corn; Ln (NO emission) = 77.917 - 6.19*T + 0.1243*T-2 + 0.0068*TEN2; R-2 = 0.65 for soybean) appear to be the best overall model for predicting soil NO emissions.

AB We summarize and evaluate 23 studies of the effect of fertilizer use on nitric oxide (NO) emission from agricultural soils. To quantify this effect we selected only field-scale studies with duration of at least one complete growing season and excluded studies with a legume as the principle crop. Only 6 studies met the established criteria, resulting in a total of 12 observations of soil/crop/fertilizer combinations, all in temperate areas. For these studies, the amount of NO emitted was linearly related to the amount of fertilizer applied (R-2 = 0.64) and about 0.5% of applied nitrogen was emitted as NO during the crop growing season. The available data are too limited to separate the effects of fertilizer type, soil type, or crop management.

AB Arable soils are a significant source of nitric oxide (NO), a precursor of tropospheric ozone, and thereby contribute to ozone pollution. However, their actual impact on ozone formation is strongly related to their spatial and temporal emission patterns, which warrant high-resolution estimates Here, we combined an agro-ecosystem model and geo-referenced databases to map these sources over the 12 000 km(2) administrative region surrounding Paris, France, with a kilometric level resolution The six most frequent arable crop species were simulated, with emission rates ranging from 14 kg N-NO ha(-1) yr(-1) to 11.1 kg N-NO ha(-1) yr(-1). The overall emission factor for fertilizer-cleaved NO emissions was 1.7%, while background emissions contributed half of the total NO efflux. Emissions were strongly seasonal, being highest in spring due to fertilizer inputs They were mostly sensitive to soil type, crops' growing season and fertilizer N rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A classic framework for soil nitrogen (N) cycling, the hole in the pipe (HIP) model, posits a trade-off in emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) as a function of soil moisture. This has been incorporated into ecosystem models but not tested experimentally and remains an important uncertainty for understanding potential hotspots of reactive N emissions: poorly drained agricultural soils that experience episodically high moisture following intensive fertilization. We incubated soils at moisture ranging from 44% to 100% water-filled pore space (WFPS). Counter to HIP, we did not observe a consistent trade-off in NO and N2O emissions at intermediate moisture levels following fertilization, and prefertilization emissions were low. Emissions of N as N2O exceeded NO by 2-200-fold at all moisture levels and peaked at 73-82% WFPS. Emissions of NO declined with moisture but remained significant even under saturated conditions. Increases in nitrite and reduced iron at high moisture indicated possible NO production from chemodenitrification. Potential nitrification rates were 100-1,000-fold greater than potential denitrification. Emission factors for fertilizer N ranged from 0.05% to 0.58% (mean=0.2%) for NO and from 0.4% to 16.9% (mean=5.3%) for N2O. Our results caution the use of WFPS to predict NO:N2O emission ratios as often employed in ecosystem models. Subsurface N cycling may suppress emissions of NO relative to N2O, and N2O emissions can persist under saturated conditions. Elevated N2O emissions from in-field wet spots comprising a small landscape extent could potentially address disparities between top-down and bottom-up N2O budgets.
   Plain Language Summary Nitric oxide and nitrous oxide are environmentally harmful gases: they contribute to climate change, the loss of good ozone high in the atmosphere that protects us from damaging sunlight, and the production of bad ozone that pollutes our air. The activities of microorganisms in soils are important sources of these gases to the atmosphere, and fertilized agricultural soils have particularly high emissions. Conceptual and mathematical models are often used to predict how nitrous and nitric oxide emissions respond to environmental changes and to guide policy and management. Here we tested a key assumption of a classic conceptual model that is widely used to estimate soil nitrous and nitric oxide emissions, using a laboratory experiment with two poorly drained agricultural soils. We found that there was not a clear trade-off in the emissions of nitric versus nitrous oxide as soil moisture varied from low to high levels, in contrast to predictions. Rather, emissions of nitrous oxide were greater than expected, and production of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide persisted under very wet conditions. Poorly drained patches of intensively fertilized agricultural soils could represent important sources of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere.

AB A better understanding of nitric oxide (NO) emission from a typical rice-wheat agroecosystem in eastern China is important for calculating the regional inventory and to propose effective NO mitigation options. Nitric oxide flux measurements by static chamber method were made from treatments of conventional nitrogen-fertilizer (NPK plus urea) application, no-nitrogen application, and nitrogen-fertilizer with incorporation of wheat straw residue for an entire rotation period (June 2002 to June 2003). During the wheat growing season two further treatments of fertilizer without crops planted and bare soil without nitrogen (N) fertilization were applied. Total annual NO emissions for the conventional fertilizer, no N fertilizer and fertilizer plus straw application were 0.44 +/- 0.01, 0.22 +/- 0.01, and 0.57 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1)y(-1), respectively. On average 27% of this emission occurred during the rice season due to flooding/drainage cycle. The N fertilizer-induced emission factor for the conventional fertilizer treatment was 0.05% of the total N applied. Incorporation of wheat straw in the rice season showed no significant effect on NO flux due to the high C/N ratio of the straw incorporated. During the wheat growing season, NO emissions for all treatments had similar variation pattern controlled by soil moisture dynamics. Total NO emissions in the wheat season for fertilized bare soil (no wheat planted) were 0.389 +/- 0.01 and 0.21 +/- 0.01 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. The results indicate the importance of N fertilizer and soil moisture to nitrogen loss through the formation of NO.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were measured from experimental dung and urine patches placed on boreal pasture soil during two growing seasons and one autumn period until soil freezing. N2O emissions in situ were studied by a static chamber method. NO was measured with a dynamic chamber method using a NO analyser in situ. Mean emissions from the control plots were 47.6 +/- 4.5 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 12.6 +/- 1.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1). N2O and NO emissions from urine plots (132 +/- 21.2 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 51.9 +/- 7.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)) were higher than those from dung plots (110.0 +/- 20.1 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 14.7 +/- 2.1 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)). There was a large temporal variation in N2O and NO emissions. Maximum N2O emissions were measured a few weeks after dung or urine application, whereas the maximum NO emissions were detected the following year. NO was responsible on average 14% (autumn) and 34% (summer) of total (NO + N2O)-N emissions from the pasture soil. NO emissions increased with increasing soil temperature and with decreasing soil moisture. N2O emissions increased with increasing soil moisture, but did not correlate with soil temperature. Therefore we propose that N2O and NO were produced mainly during different microbial processes, i.e., nitrification and denitrification, respectively. The results show that the overall conditions and mechanism especially for emissions of NO are still poorly understood but that there are differences in the mechanisms regulating N2O and NO production.

AB Gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx), which result from the combustion of fossil fuels, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and biological reactions in soils, not only affect air quality and the atmospheric concentration of ozone, but also contribute to global warming and acid rain. Soil NOx emissions have been largely ascribed to soil microbiological processes; but there is no proof of abiotic catalytic activity affecting soil NO emissions. We provide evidence of gas exchange in soils involving emissions of NOx by photochemical reactions, and their counterpart fixation through photocatalytic reactions under UV-visible irradiation. The catalytic activity promoting NOx capture as nitrate varied widely amongst different soil types, from low in quartzitic sandy soils to high in iron oxide and TiO2 rich soils. Clay soils with significant amounts of smectite also exhibited high rates of NOx sequestration and fixed amounts of N comparable to that of NO (nitric oxide) losses through biotic reactions. In these soils, a flux of 100 mu g N-NO m(-2) h(-1), as usually found in most ecosystems, could be reduced by these photochemical reactions by more than 60%. This mechanism of N fixation provides new insight into the nitrogen cycle and may inspire alternative strategies to reduce NO emissions from soils. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While inventories for anthropogenic NO, sources are presently among the most thorough compilations of pollutants' emissions, our knowledge on biogenic NO emissions is comparatively poor. A brief overview is given about (a) the importance of NOx emissions for tropospheric chemistry, (b) the present estimate of global NO emissions, (c) techniques suitable for the mesurement of NO surface exchange, (d) microbial and abiotic processes regulating the soil-biogenic NO emission and its main influencing factors, and (e) the present state of modeling (global) soil-biogenic NO inventories.

AB To reduce uncertainties in the highly variable estimates of NO emission from N fertilizer, we compiled and analyzed available reports of field measurements on fertilizer-induced NO emission. Three statistical distribution models, lognormal, gamma and Weibull, were used to fit the observation data. Results show that while all three models fit the observation data statistically, the lognormal model is not applicable to this data set. A mean fertilizer-induced NO emission ratio of 0.71% was derived from a Weibull distribution, which is the besting fitting model.

AB Woody vegetation has encroached into areas once dominated by herbaceous land cover in and and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States and around the world, resulting in documented changes to the biophysical and biogeochemical structure of these ecosystems during the past century. In North Texas rangelands, encroaching mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa), a known nitrogen (N)-fixing species, has caused changes in aboveground biomass, which, in turn, have influenced carbon (C) and N storage in surface soils. However, the effect on N oxide (nitric-NO and nitrous-N2O oxide) emissions from the soils was unknown. We examined biotic (vegetation type and soil organic and inorganic N dynamics) and abiotic (soil moisture, temperature, and soil texture) controls over soil NO and N2O emissions across a gradient of aboveground Prosopis biomass growing on two soil types. Soil N oxide fluxes were dominated by NO emissions produced during nitrification. Aboveground biomass was the best spatial, predictor of NO emissions, with values increasing 20-fold (0.04-0.78 mg NO-N.m(-2).d(-1)) across a 70-fold biomass gradient (5-350 g/m(2)). Emissions also covaried with soil pH and clay content. Microsite position, under or between the mesquite canopies, did not influence NO emission rates. NO fluxes were four times higher from clay loam than from shallow clay soils; however, soil N properties (total organic N and extractable inorganic N) and cycling rates (mineralization and nitrification). did not differ significantly across the sites. Temporally, NO emissions and nitrification potential were positively correlated with temperature, with precipitation events elevating NO emissions fourfold over a 24-h period and producing small amounts of N2O, We conclude that mesquite encroachment in these grasslands increases NO emissions in a spatially explicit manner influenced by the Aboveground biomass and soil type, which is then temporally mediated primarily by temperature and secondarily by precipitation.

AB Acidic soils are hotspots of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) and biochar is documented to have the potential for mitigating N2O and NO. The N2O and NO emissions associated with soil functional genes and physicochemical properties under biochar amendment remains unclear in acidic soils. Here, we carried out a two-year field study to examine the responses of soil N2O and NO emissions to biochar amendment in a subtropical tea plantation in China. Measurements of N2O and NO fluxes were taken from inter-row soils using the static chamber method. We also measured the seasonal changes in soil key nitrogen (N)-cycling functional genes and physicochemical properties. Annual N2O and NO emissions averaged 27.31 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 8.75 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the N fertilizer applied plots, which were decreased by 24% and 16% due to biochar application, respectively. In addition, both potential nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDR) rates were stimulated by biochar amendment, which significantly increased the abundances of bacterial amoA (AOB), nirK and nosZ genes. Changes in the composition of the N2O-related microbial functional community were closely associated with soil PNR, pH, DOC, and NO3--N contents. The ratios of NO/N2O were mainly lower than 1, suggesting that N2O was produced mostly through denitrification rather than nitrification. There were negative correlations between soil N2O and NO emissions and soil PDR and pH, and soil N2O emissions were negatively correlated with nosZ gene abundances. Together, the decrease in N2O and NO emissions following biochar application could be largely attributed to the enhanced denitrification process, in which biochar enriched the nirK and nosZ genes abundance, resulting from the enhancement of soil DOC and pH in acidic soils.

AB The importance of soil parameters and the other environmental conditions that affect emission rates of NO and N2O were studied over a fertilised wheat field. Open-chamber and closed-chamber techniques were used for the flux measurement of NO and N2O, respectively. Both gases showed variation in the emission rates which followed the seasonal variation in the available HN4+ and NO3- and the moisture content of the soil. Whilst N2O emission rates increased with the moisture content of the soil, NO emissions decreased with increasing soil moisture and rainfall. The results suggested that most soil variables and atmospheric parameters had similar effects on both NO and N2O emission rates but that the overriding influence upon the NO/N2O emission ratio is the soil moisture content. The NO flux showed a clear diurnal variation which followed the surface soil temperature with an activation energy of 108 kJ mol(-1). The annual NO flux estimated from this study (0.79 kg N ha(-1)) was approximately half the corresponding N2O (1.42 kg N ha(-1)).

AB An incubation experiment was conducted to examine the effects of the phosphorus (P) application on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from soils of an Acacia mangium plantation in Indonesia. The soils were incubated with and without the addition of P (Ca[H2PO4](2); 2 mg P g soil-1) after adjusting the water-filled pore space (WFPS) to 75% or 100%. The P addition increased N2O emissions under both WFPS conditions and NO emissions at 75% WFPS. Some possible mechanisms are considered. First, the P addition stimulated nitrogen (N) cycling, and N used for nitrification and/or denitrification also increased. Second, the P addition could have relieved the P shortage for nitrifying and/or denitrifying bacteria, producing N2O and NO. Our results suggest that the application of P fertilizer has the potential to stimulate N2O and NO emissions from Acacia mangium plantations, at least when soils are under relatively wet conditions.

AB Woody encroachment, a spatially explicit process of land-cover change, is known to affect the biophysical and biogeochemical properties of ecosystems. However, little information is available on the impacts of woody encroachment on N oxide emissions from savanna regions. We combined hyperspectral remote sensing and field measurements to quantify spatial patterns and estimate regional fluxes of soil N oxide emissions as they covary with vegetation cover and soil type across a semiarid rangeland in north Texas. Soil nitric oxide ( NO) emissions were highly correlated with Prosopis canopy cover, allowing the extrapolation of NO fluxes from hyperspectral observations of woody cover. NO emissions were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 550 kg NO-N km(-2) y(-1) across the region, with the lowest emissions from shallow clay soils and highest from deeper upland clay loams. An estimate of annual NO emissions based on remotely derived Prosopis cover, temperature, and precipitation was 160 kg NO-N km(-2) y(-1), almost twice that of the value derived from traditional averaging of field measurements. We conclude that relationships between NO emissions and remotely sensed structure and composition are advantageous for quantifying NO emissions at the regional scale. This study also provides new insight into the role of woody encroachment on biogeochemical processes that are highly variable and otherwise difficult to measure at the regional scale.

AB Biochar impact on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from intensive greenhouse vegetable cropping systems is not well established. Annual soil N2O and NO emissions were simultaneously measured from a typical greenhouse vegetable field treated with different biochar application rates in southeast China. Both N2O and NO emissions differed greatly across the individual vegetable cropping seasons, of which being higher in green soybean and tomato growing seasons, respectively. Over the annual vegetable cropping rotation, biochar amendment decreased soil N2O and NO emissions by 10-23% and 18-19% relative to N fertilization alone, respectively. Biochar rate of 20 t ha(-1) gained the lowest N2O and NO emissions over the annual cycle. The ratio of NO/N2O was negatively correlated with soil moisture and depends on biochar addition or not. On average, annual emission factor (EF) of N2O and NO combined was accounted for 2.13% with biochar amendment, which was decreased by 22% compared with N fertilization alone (EF = 2.74%). Vegetable yield was significantly enhanced under the biochar combined with N fertilizer plots relative to control, while there is no difference among the N fertilization treatments with or without biochar amendment. Therefore, biochar could be used as an effective management mitigating soil N2O and NO emissions while maintaining crop yield in greenhouse vegetable cropping systems in southeast China.

AB In order to estimate potential greenhouse gas flux rates from soils under different land use and climate, and to particularly assess the influence of soil temperature and soil moisture, we measured fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from intact soil cores obtained from 13 European sites under controlled laboratory conditions. The soils covered the different climates of Europe and included four different land-use types: croplands, forests, grasslands and wetlands. In a two-factorial experimental design, the soil cores were incubated under four temperatures (5-20 degrees C) and water contents (20-80% water-filled pore space). We found a non-linear increase of N2O, NO and CO2 emissions with increasing temperature. Nitrous oxide emissions were positively correlated with soil moisture, while NO emission and CH4 oxidation rates were negatively correlated with soil moisture. Maximum CO2 emissions occurred at intermediate soil moisture.
   Different land-use types strongly affected greenhouse gas fluxes. Nitrous oxide and CO2 emissions were highest in grassland soils, while NO emissions were highest in forest soils. In grasslands, high soil microbial activity stimulated by high carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents, dense root systems and high C input from above-ground decaying biomass was the most likely cause for high N2O and CO2 emissions. High NO emissions from forest soils were mainly attributed to low pH and high soil porosity. Northern soils showed the greatest capacity to take up CH4 under warmer and dryer soil conditions. Nitric oxide emissions were positively correlated with N input.

AB Soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions are variable in both space and time, and are important pathways for N loss in seasonally dry ecosystems that undergo abrupt transitions from dry-to-wet soil conditions. We measured soil NO emissions from a chaparral catchment to characterize seasonal variability of, and triggers for enhanced NO losses. Pulses in NO emissions were observed in the summer and autumn when dry soils (soil water content (theta) < 6%) were wetted naturally and artificially (range: 97-513 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1)). The rapidity and magnitude of these pulses suggest that abiotic processes may influence NO emissions. Outside of the observed pulses, NO emissions were highest during the dry season (theta < 6%; dry season mean = 3.4 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1)) and lowest during the winter wet season (theta> 20%; wet season mean = 0.14 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1)). These observed seasonal patterns contrast with previous DAYCENT simulations of NO emissions in our catchment, which predicted higher NO emissions during the wet season. Our field observations are consistent with sustained rates of nitrification, reduced plant N uptake, and high soil gas diffusivity observed during the dry season in arid environments.

AB Subtropical agricultural soils are hotspots of nitrogen(N)-oxide emissions, whereas the spatiotemporal variability and driving factors of their emissions in different cultivation systems are poorly understood. Here, to assess the magnitude and pattern of soil N-oxide emissions, we conducted measurements of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from the soil between rows and under the canopy of tea plants in two subtropical tea plantations over a one-year period. Results showed that N2O and NO emissions from the soil between rows were 32.6 and 9.1 kg N ha(-1) for the Yixing (YX) site and 33.9 and 9.9 kg N ha 1 for the Jurong (JR) site, respectively. Across both sites, N2O and NO emissions from the soil between rows were 2.8-5.2 and 1.4-4.0 times, respectively, larger than those from the soil under the canopy. We attributed greater N-oxide emissions from the soil between rows mainly to increased soil mineral N and water contents as compared to the soil under the canopy. On average, N2O and NO emissions from the soil under the canopy accounted for 36% and 44% of the total losses from the entire field, respectively. For the entire tea field, N2O emissions were 12.6 and 15.7 kg N ha(-1) for the YX and JR sites, respectively, but the difference was not statistically different. In contrast, NO emissions from the YX and JR sites were 3.8 and 5.7 kg N ha(-1) and differed significantly between the two sites, which was due to higher NO emissions from the soil under the canopy in the JR site. The greatest N-oxide fluxes occurred in the spring and summer seasons after topdressing when soil conditions were conducive to microbial N-oxide production. The structural equation modeling analyses suggested that the variables explaining the variances of soil N-oxide emissions were different between the two tea plantations. Our results indicated that microbial nitrification and abiotic chemodenitrification processes were likely the major pathways leading to N-oxide emissions in the soil under the canopy. Our findings highlight the importance of N-oxide fluxes simultaneously taken from the soil between rows and under the canopy and implementing mitigation practices in subtropical tea plantations.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes resulting from long-term tomato cultivation in a glasshouse were continuously determined using the flow-through chamber method over the course of three cultivation periods. Gas concentrations were measured using an nondispersive infrared (gas filter correlation/infra-red) analyzer and a chemiluminescence-based analyzer, respectively. Following a basal application of fertilizer, daily N2O and NO emission rates increased, with peaks lasting from 40 to 140 days. Short-term fluctuations in daily N2O and NO emissions were affected by differences in nitrogen application, soil water, and soil temperature. Diurnal changes in N2O and NO fluxes during the period of peak emissions depended primarily on soil temperature. Following the application of a top dressing (N as urea or calcium nitrate) in the irrigation water, the N2O and NO fluxes increased immediately, with a very short period of peak emissions (1-5 h) after urea application. The duration of the peak period in daily accumulated N2O and NO emissions following application of the top dressing ranged from 3 to 10 days.

AB Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a freely drained sandy loam, fertilized with (NH4)2SO4 or KNO3 (100 kg N ha-1) with or without the addition of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD), were measured. The addition of N fertilizers increased emissions of NO and N2O. For plots fertilized with (NH4)2SO4, NO emissions increased from 2.4 to 46.9 ng NO-N m-2 s-1 (2.1-40.5 g NO-N ha-1 day-1), in the first 7 days after fertilizer application. Nitrous oxide emission rates were considerably lower, ranging from 0.95 to 7.4 ng N2O-N m-2 s-1 (0.82-6.4 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1).
   Nitrification rather than denitrification was the source of the NO emitted from the soil; additions of DCD inhibited the emissions by at least 92%. Nitrous oxide, on the other hand, was a product of both nitrification and denitrification. When soils were dry, N2O was produced predominantly by nitrification and DCD reduced emissions by at least 40%. In contrast, in wet conditions denitrification was the main source of N2O and emissions were not inhibited by DCD.
   Nitric oxide emissions correlated significantly with soil temperature (30 mm depth), the air temperature inside the chamber, soil available NH4+, and were significantly reduced by watering the soil. Apparent activation energies, calculated from the temperature response in the NO emission rates, ranged from 30 to 71 kJ mol-1. It was concluded from the close links between air temperature in the chamber and the NO emission rates that the NO was produced very close to the soil surface.
   During nitrification the rate of depletion of NH4+-N emitted as NO-N was 5.5 x 10(-5) s-1. It was estimated that for cultivated fields 0.15-0.75% of the applied NH4+ fertilizer is released as NO.

AB Information from 846 N2O emission measurements in agricultural fields and 99 measurements for NO emissions was summarized to assess the influence of various factors regulating emissions from mineral soils. The data indicate that there is a strong increase of both N2O and NO emissions accompanying N application rates, and soils with high organic-C content show higher emissions than less fertile soils. A fine soil texture, restricted drainage, and neutral to slightly acidic conditions favor N2O emission, while (though not significant) a good soil drainage, coarse texture, and neutral soil reaction favor NO emission. Fertilizer type and crop type are important factors for N2O but not for NO, while the fertilizer application mode has a significant influence on NO only. Regarding the measurements, longer measurement periods yield more of the fertilization effect on N2O and NO emissions, and intensive measurements (greater than or equal to1 per day) yield lower emissions than less intensive measurements (2-3 per week). The available data can be used to develop simple models based on the major regulating factors which describe the spatial variability of emissions of N2O and NO with less uncertainty than emission factor approaches based on country N inputs, as currently used in national emission inventories.

AB Agricultural soils are important sources of the tropospheric ozone precursor NO and the greenhouse gas N2O. Emissions are controlled primarily by parameters that vary the soil mineral N supply, temperature and soil aeration. In this field experiment, the importance of soil physical properties on emissions of NO and N2O are identified. Fluxes were measured from 13 soils which belonged to 11 different soil series, ranging from poorly drained silty clay loams to freely drained sandy loams. All soils were under the same soil management regime and crop type (winter barley) and in the same maritime climate zone. Despite this, emissions of NO and N2O ranged over two orders of magnitude on all three measurement occasions, in spring before and after fertilizer application, and in autumn after harvest. NO emissions ranged from 0.3 to 215 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1), with maximum emissions always from the most sandy, freely drained soil. Nitrous oxide emissions ranged from 0 to 193 mug N2O-N m(-2) h(-1). Seasonal shifts in soil aeration caused maximum N2O emissions to switch from freely drained sandy soils in spring to imperfectly drained soils with high clay contents in autumn. Although effects of soil type on emissions were not consistent, N2O emission was best related to a combination of bulk density and clay content and the NO/N2O ratio decreased logarithmically with increasing water filled pore space.

AB Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) as a surrogate indicator of toluene bioremediation from toluene-contaminated soil were measured to correlate NO and toluene contamination relationships. The goal of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the relationships between NO emissions and toluene contamination, which describes the influence of the level of toluene contamination on NO emission from the soil. Laboratory experiments were performed under controlled temperature (22 degrees C and water-filled pore space (WFPS, 30%) conditions, with varying toluene concentrations (0, 5, 30, 45, and 60 ppm), as well as with variations in the experimental duration (1, 4, 8, and 16 h, 1, 2, 3, and 5 days, and I week). The relationships have been analyzed by the comparison of experimental measurements coming from analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical analysis, referring to toluene concentrations (0, 5, 30, 45, and 60 ppm). NO emissions were positively and significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with the level of toluene concentration and duration of toluene contamination. Thus, NO emissions are suggested as a good indicator of the level of toluene in contaminated soils.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) emissions from soil amended with municipal wastewater biosolids or mineral fertilizer can adversely impact ozone levels in the lower troposphere and are studied here. A comprehensive laboratory protocol was developed and conducted to consider the influence of biosolids-amended (BSA) soil and mineral-fertilizer-amended (MFA) soil, as compared with unamended soil, on NO emissions with varying temperature, moisture content, and pH. NO plays an important role in the formation of tropospheric ozone. Minimization of NO flux from soil is advantageous, protecting air quality as well as conserving valued nitrogen fertilizers. BSA and MFA soils were found to produce NO emissions over five times greater than unamended soils. Distinctions between NO flux from MFA and BSA soil cannot be made. NO flux from soils at pH 6.25 and 6.75 were not found to be statistically different. Soils with higher water-filled pore space (WFPS) and temperature are generally shown to produce greater quantities of NO within the range of temperature (15 degrees -28 degreesC) and WFPS (3-40%) studied.

AB Agricultural soils are the hotspots of nitric oxide (NO) emissions, which are related to atmospheric pollution and greenhouse effect. Biochar application has been recommended as an important countermeasure, however, its mitigation efficiency is limited as biochar, under certain conditions, can stimulate soil nitrification. Therefore, biochar co-applied with nitrification inhibitor could optimize the mitigation potential of biochar. Herein, a laboratory-scale experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of co-application of biochar and nitrification inhibitor on NO emission, nitrogen cycling function and bacterial community in a tropical vegetable soil. Results showed that a single application of biochar or nitrification inhibitor significantly decreased NO emissions, and this mitigation effectiveness was amplified by their co-applications. Soil NO2--N intensity, along with abun-dances of AOB-amoA and nirK were significantly and positively correlated with cumulative NO emissions. The stimulated activity of ammonia monooxygenase and growths of AOB and total comammox Nitrospira by biochar were weakened by nitrification inhibitor, implying decreased nitrification-driven NO production. The nitric oxide reductase activity and related qnorB abundance in nitrification inhibitor-added soils were increased by biochar, indicating promoted NO consumption during denitrification. The nirK abundance and NO2--N intensity were decreased more by co-applications of biochar or nitrification inhibitor. Moreover, both biochar and nitri-fication inhibitor changed bacterial beta-diversity, and their co-application synergistically enriched Armatimona-detes and Verrucomicrobia abundances and decreased WPS-2 abundance. This study highlights that co -applications of biochar and nitrification inhibitor can make their respective advantages complementary to each other, thereby achieving a larger mitigation of NO emissions from agricultural soils in tropical regions.

AB Studies of forest nitrogen (N) budgets generally measure inputs from the atmosphere in wet and dry deposition and outputs via hydrologic export. Although denitrification has been shown to be important in many wetland ecosystems, emission of N oxides from forest soils is an important, and often overlooked, component of an ecosystem N budget. During I year (2002-03), emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured from Sessile oak and Norway spruce forest soils in northeast Hungary. Accumulation in small static chambers followed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry detection was used for the estimation of N2O emission flux. Because there are rapid chemical reactions of NO and ozone, small dynamic chambers were used for in situ NO flux measurements. Average soil emissions of NO were 1.2 and 2.1 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), and for N2O were 15 and 20 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), for spruce and oak soils, respectively. Due to the relatively high soil water content, and low C/N ratio in soil, denitrification processes dominate, resulting in an order of magnitude greater N2O emission rate compared to NO. The previously determined N balance between the atmosphere and the forest ecosystem was re-calculated using these soil emission figures. The total (dry + wet) atmospheric N-deposition to the soil was 1.42 and 1.59 g N m(-2) yr(-1) for spruce and oak, respectively, while the soil emissions are 0.14 and 0.20 g N m(-2) yr(-1). Thus, about 10-13% of N compounds deposited to the soil, mostly as NH3/NH4+ and HNO3/NO3- were transformed in the soil and emitted back to the atmosphere, mostly as greenhouse gas (N2O).

AB Global warming and elevated tropospheric ozone (O3) regulate the fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) in wheat-rice fields. However, their combined effects on N2O and NO emissions in an intensified wheat fields remain underexplored. Here, a three-year field study was conducted to assess the effects of elevated O3 and warming on nitrogen oxide emissions and clarify key influencing factors within a free-air O3 concentration elevation and warming system. Results showed that, on average, elevated O3 significantly inhibited N2O (-16.4 %) and NO (-34.6 %) emissions from wheat fields at ambient temperature across years. Conversely, warming increased N2O (+19.0 %) and NO (+67.4 %) emissions, especially after fertilization and during the late period of wheat growth. Compared to warming, combined treatment of elevated O3 and warming significantly reduced N2O (-17.8 %) and NO (-32.7 %) emissions. The effects of elevated O3 and warming on N2O emission were related to significant changes in soil NH4+ , NO3- , and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content but not to soil microbial biomass nitrogen, or pH. Warming also stimulated N2O emissions by reducing soil moisture and increasing temperature. The effect of elevated O3 on soil NO emissions was mainly related to soil DOC and pH. Warming mainly stimulated NO emissions by increasing soil temperature and soil DOC and reducing soil moisture. Our results indicate that the inhibitory effect of high O3 concentration needs to be incorporated into global change models for cropland nitrogen oxide emissions.

AB To quantify the spatial variation and spatial structure of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emission from forest soils, we measured N2O and NO emission rates from surface soil cores taken at 1 m intervals on a cross-line transect (65 m x 20 m) on a slope of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) forest in a temperate region of central Japan and analyzed the spatial dependency of N oxide gas emissions using geostatistics. We divided N2O emission into N2O from denitrification and N2O from nitrification using the acetylene inhibition method. According to the geostatistical analysis, N2O emission rates on the slope had large spatial variation and weak spatial dependency. This weak spatial dependency was caused by the inordinately high N2O emissions on the slope, which were derived mainly from denitrification. In contrast, NO emission rate on the slope had large spatial variation, but strong spatial dependency and a distinct spatial distribution related to slope position, that is, high in the middle of the slope and low in the shoulder and the foot of the slope. The CN ratio and water-filled pore space were the dominant factors controlling NO emission rate on a slope. Our results suggest that spatial information about topographic factors helps to improve the estimation of both N2O emission and NO emission from forest soils.

AB Equipment and procedures are developed and implemented to measure nitric oxide (NO) emissions from unamended and municipal wastewater treatment plant biosolids-amended soil in controlled laboratory experiments and in situ field experiments. NO plays an important role in the formation of tropospheric ozone. Minimization of NO flux from soil is advantageous, protecting air quality as well as conserving valued nitrogen fertilizers. Controlled laboratory and in situ field measurements of soil NO flux were conducted on similar soil types under similar water-filled pore space (WFPS) and temperature conditions. The difference in NO emissions between the lab and the field measurements was statistically significant within the WFPS range (18.1 to 45.3%) and temperature range (12 to 28 C) studied. The soil NO flux measured in the lab ranged from 2.5 to 62.9 ng-N/m(2)s) compared to 2.8 to 128.1 ng-N/(m(2)s) for field measurements. The NO flux from biosolids amended soil was significantly higher than unamended soil. Temperature relationships modeling NO flux for the lab and field experiments are developed and compared to the EPA's BEIS2 model.

AB Emissions of gaseous forms of nitrogen from soil, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), have shown great impact on global warming and atmospheric chemistry. Although in soil both nitrification and denitrification could cause N2O and NO emissions, most studies demonstrated that denitrification is the dominant process responsible for the increase of atmospheric N2O, while nitrification produces mostly NO. The use of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) has repeatedly been shown to reduce both N2O and NO emissions from agricultural soils; nevertheless, the efficiency of the mitigation effect varies greatly. It is generally assumed that nitrification inhibitors have no direct effect on denitrification. However, the indirect impact, due to the reduced substrate (nitrate) delivery to microsites where denitrification occurs, may have significant effects on denitrification product stoichiometry that may significantly lower soil borne N2O emissions. Soil-water status is considered to have a remarkable effect on the relative fluxes of nitrogen gases. The effect and mechanism of NI on N2O, NO and N-2 emission under different soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) is still not well explored. In the present study, we conducted a soil incubation experiment in an automated continuous-flow incubation system under a He/O-2 atmosphere. Ammonium sulfate was applied with and without NI (DMPP) to a permanent UK grassland soil under three different soil moisture conditions (50, 65, and 80% WFPS). With every treatment, glucose was applied to supply enough available carbon for denitrification. Emissions of CO2, N2O, NO and N-2 were investigated. Additionally, isotopic signatures of soil-emitted N2O were analyzed. Generally, higher WFPS led to higher N2O and NO emissions, while N-2 emissions were only detected at high soil moisture condition (80% WFPS). Different processes were responsible for N2O and NO emission in different phases of the incubation period. The application of DMPP did significantly reduce both N2O and NO emissions at all three soil moisture conditions. Furthermore, DMPP application increased N-2 emissions and decreased the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio at 80% WFPS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agroforestry systems, often incorporating N-fixing trees, are widely used in tropical countries. However, the effect of such systems on the emissions of atmospheric pollutants NO and N2O is largely unknown. Here we compare the emissions from two agroforest systems, one where the tree component is the nitrogen fixing tree species (Calliandra calothyrsus) and the other where the tree component does not fix N (Grevillea robusta). The experiment simulated the first rainfall of a wet season, which has been shown to be a major source of NO and N2O emissions in tropical soils. Light (10 mm rain) and heavy rainfall (25 mm rain) was added to small repacked soil columns. Light rainfall resulted in a brief flush of NO up to 96 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1) within 1 day of wetting. Nitrous oxide emissions were negligible, In contrast heavy rainfall produced a flush in N2O emissions up to 2000 mug N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), but no NO. Responses were at least 4 times larger for soils from the N fixing trees compared to the non-N fixing trees.

AB Contradictory effects of simultaneous available organic C and N sources on nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes are reported in the literature. in order to clarify this controversy, laboratory experiments were conduced on two different soils, a semiarid arable soil from Spain (soil 1, pH = 7.5 0.8%C) and a grassland soil from Scotland (soil 11, pH = 5.5 4.1 %C). Soils were incubated at two different moisture contents, at a water filled pore space (WFPS) of 90% and 40%. Ammonium sulphate, added at rates equivalent to 200 and 50 kg N ha(-1), stimulated N2O and NO emissions in both soils. Under wet conditions (90% WFPS), at high and low rates of N additions, cumulative NO emissions increased by 250.7 and 8.1 ng N2O-Ng(-1) in comparison to the control, respectively,. in soil I and by 472.2 and 2.1 ng N2O-Ng(-1), respectively,in soil II. NO emissions only significantly increased in soil I at the high N application rate with and without glucose addition and at both 40% and 90% WHIS. In both soils additions of glucose together with the high N application rate (200 kg N ha(-1)) reduced Cumulative N2O and NO emissions by 94% and 55% in soil I. and by 46% and 66% in soil 11, respectively. These differences can be explained by differences in soil properties, including pH, soil mineral N and total and dissolved organic carbon content. It is speculated that nitrifier denitrification was the main source of NO and N2O in the C-poor Spanish soil, and coupled nitrification-denitrification in the C-rich Scottish soil.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) plays a central role in the formation of tropospheric ozone, hydroxyl radicals, as well as nitrous and nitric acids. There are, however, large uncertainties around estimates of global NO emissions due to the paucity of data. In particular, there is little information on the rate of NO emission and its sensitivity to processes such as land use changes in dry environments. Here we report on a two-year study on the influence of afforestation on soil NO fluxes in the semi-arid afforestation system in Southern Israel (Yatir forest, mean annual precipitation similar to 280 mm). Laboratory incubations were carried out under seasonally defined conditions of soil moisture and temperature using soils sampled in different seasons from the native shrubland (taken both under shrub canopy and in the inter-shrub areas), and from the adjacent similar to 2800 ha, 40-year-old pine afforestation site. Combining laboratory results with field measurements of soil moisture and temperature, we up-scaled soil-atmosphere NO fluxes to the ecosystem level. The different microsites differed in their annual mean NO release rates (0.04, 0.14 and 0.03 mg m(-2) d(-1) for the shrubland under and between shrubs and for the forest, respectively), and exhibited high inter-seasonal variability in NO emission rates (ranging from zero up to 0.25 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the wet and dry-rewetting seasons, respectively), as well as in temperature responses. Up-scaling results to annual and ecosystem scales indicated that afforestation of the semi-arid shrubland could reduce soil NO emission by up to 65%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen oxides (NO (x) ) are involved in acid rain and ozone formation, as well as destruction. NO (x) are climate-relevant trace gases in the atmosphere. Atmospheric NO (x) originate from anthropogenic emissions (mainly combustion processes). NO from natural processes derives from thunderstorms and soil microbial processes. They may play a crucial role in soil-atmosphere feedback processes. This study aims to investigate NO (x) -emissions from soils under different land use, geographical and meteorological conditions. NO (x) -emissions were quantified in both field and laboratory experiments with a closed static chamber. Disturbed soil samples have been used for laboratory experiments. A climate chamber was used to regulate soil temperature of the samples. Field experiments showed that NO-soil emissions strongly depend on soil temperature. NO-emissions from a soil under meadow showed significant daily variations, unlike soil below spruce forest. Peak emission values were 18 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) above meadow and 1.3 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) under forest canopy. In addition, NO-emissions of meadow and forest soil were studied in a climate chamber, enhanced by an additional experiment with agricultural soil. These experiments revealed strong exponential correlations of NO-emissions and soil temperature. Maximum values reached above 400 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) from agricultural soils at soil temperatures above 50A degrees C. This study shows that soil NO-emissions strongly depend on temperature, vegetation type and geographical position. Consequently, NO-emissions may have a positive feedback effect on climate change.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is an important component of biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen, produced via biologically mediated processes of nitrification and denitrification in soils. The production and consumption processes of NO in black soils are not fully understood. We established how moisture and temperature affect NO dynamics for black soil samples of maize land in the temperate zone of northeastern China. The optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO production and emission was determined to be 41% water-filled pore space (WFPS), based on laboratory experiments and modeling. For a given moisture, NO fluxes increased exponentially with soil temperature at any given soil moisture. The optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO emission was constant and independent of soil temperature. The NO consumption rate constant (k) in the studied soil (range 9.31 x 10(-6)-15.1 x 10(-6) m(3) kg(-1) s(-1)) was in the middle of the range of similar k values published to date. The maximum NO emission potential for black soils at 25 degrees C and 15 degrees C were about 18.6 and 9.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Based on laboratory results and field monitoring data of soil water content and soil temperature, the average NO fluxes from black soils in the region were estimated to be 10.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for an entire plant growth period. NO emissions likely occur principally in July, associated with optimum soil moisture. The present study suggests that NO fluxes from black soil are much lower than the previous reports from cropland in southern parts of China. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soils are among the important sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), acting as a critical role in atmospheric chemistry. Updated data derived from 114 peerreviewed publications with 520 field measurements were synthesized using metaanalysis procedure to examine the N fertilizerinduced soil NO and the combined NO+N2O emissions across global soils. Besides factors identified in earlier reviews, additional factors responsible for NO fluxes were fertilizer type, soil C/N ratio, crop residue incorporation, tillage, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, drought and biomass burning. When averaged across all measurements, soil NON fluxes were estimated to be 4.06 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), with the greatest (9.75 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) in vegetable croplands and the lowest (0.11 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) in rice paddies. Soil NO emissions were more enhanced by synthetic N fertilizer (+38%), relative to organic (+20%) or mixed N (+18%) sources. Compared with synthetic N fertilizer alone, synthetic N fertilizer combined with nitrification inhibitors substantially reduced soil NO emissions by 81%. The global mean direct emission factors of N fertilizer for NO (EFNO) and combined NO+N2O (EFc) were estimated to be 1.16% and 2.58%, with 95% confidence intervals of 0.711.61% and 1.813.35%, respectively. Forests had the greatest EFNO (2.39%). Within the croplands, the EFNO (1.71%) and EFc (4.13%) were the greatest in vegetable cropping fields. Among different chemical N fertilizer varieties, ammonium nitrate had the greatest EFNO (2.93%) and EFc (5.97%). Some options such as organic instead of synthetic N fertilizer, decreasing N fertilizer input rate, nitrification inhibitor and low irrigation frequency could be adopted to mitigate soil NO emissions. More field measurements over multiyears are highly needed to minimize the estimate uncertainties and mitigate soil NO emissions, particularly in forests and vegetable croplands.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) released from soil is a concern since it can act as a potential atmospheric pollutant and it represents a loss of N from the soil. These gases are present in the atmosphere in trace amounts and are important to atmospheric chemistry and earth's radiative balance. Nitric oxide (NO) does not directly contribute to the greenhouse effect, but it contributes to climate forcing through its role in photochemistry of hydroxyl radicals and ozone and plays a key role in air quality issues. Nitrification and denitrification have been identified as major controlling microbial processes in soils responsible for the formation of NO and N2O. To elucidate the contribution of both processes to the release of NO and N2O from loess-black earth soils under field conditions-i.e. to evaluate nitrate and ammonium as sources of NO and N2O emission-two field experiments with either [N-15] nitrate (NO3-) or [N-15] ammonium (NH4+) labelling have been conducted at two sites differing in soil organic matter content (high and normal SOM). [N-15] nitrate treatments revealed that denitrification of NO3- represents the main pathway of soil N2O release. On average 76% and 54% of N2O was emitted during denitrification from soils with high and normal SOM content, respectively. Contrarily, denitrification contributed on average only 17% and 12% of released NO from soil with high and normal SOM content, respectively. The [N-15]ammonium treatments revealed that nitrification of NH4+ is the major process responsible for soil NO emission. SOM content of the loess-black earth soil significantly influenced NO and N2O emission. The soil with the higher SOM content showed lower NO emission but drastically increased N2O emission after nitrate fertilisation. In particular the soil with high SOM content exhibited a high sorption capacity for ammonium ions which led to unexpected results after fertilisation with [N-15]ammonium. To explain this results a revised concept containing three different interacting soil ammonium pools have been hypothesised. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agricultural soils are a major source of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which are produced and consumed by biotic and abiotic soil processes. The dominant sources of NO and N2O are microbial nitrification and denitrification. While N2O emissions have been attributed to both processes, depending on the environmental conditions such as substrate availability, pH and water filled pore space (WFPS), NO emissions are thought to predominantly derive from nitrification. Although attributing gaseous emissions to specific processes is still difficult, recent findings challenge the latter of those assumptions. Using the gas-flow-soil-core method, i.e soil cores incubated under a He/O-2 atmosphere at constant surface gas flow, combined with N-15 labelled isotopic techniques, the present study investigated the role of denitrification on NO, N2O and N-2 emissions in a UK grassland soil under high soil moisture and an aerobic headspace atmosphere. With the application of KNO3 and glucose to support denitrification, denitrification was the source of N loss of between 0.61 and 0.67% of the added N via NO emissions, 1.60-1.68% via N2O and 0.03-0.05% via N-2 emissions. Overall, our study showed that denitrification has been overlooked as a source of NO emissions. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is emitted from soils in addition to nitrous oxide (N2O). Atmospheric NO is a precursor of tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas as well as atmospheric N2O. An intensive field program has been performed to measure the flux of NO and N2O from upland fields with Andosol soils for these several years. The purpose of this program is to examine the emission rate of NO and N2O, from the application of different types of chemical nitrogen fertiliser such as easily soluble and controlled-release fertilesrs, fresh excreta and organic manure, and from the different application method such as uniform broadcasting and local band mode. We also analysed the relationship between the flux ratio of NO-N/N2O-N and water filled pore space. Mitigation options for emission of NO and N2O are discussed.

AB Conversion of "natural" savanna to agricultural soil is proceeding at a very fast rate. In this work, nitric oxide (NO) emissions were measured immediately after conversion of a "natural" grassland to fertilized agricultural fields (corn, sorghum and cultivated pasture), and also during the second and fourth year after conversion. Large fluxes were observed after plowing grassland soil, and almost no difference was observed between ammonium-fertilized and unfertilized plowed grassland soils. Soil water content and pH related negatively to NO emissions. NO emissions were positively correlated with soil nitrate concentrations and carbon content (corn only) whereas little or no correlation was found with ammonium concentrations. This suggests that in these savanna soils, the NO emitted from soil is mainly denitrification-derived. The disturbed soils emitted on average similar to 7 times more NO than the original grassland. During the second and fourth year of cultivation the emissions from corn and sorghum fields (plowed every year) were around 10 times higher than from the control grassland soils. The fertilizer-induced emission (FEI) values for NO emission estimated in this work show that similar agricultural practices could lead to dramatically different FEI values depending on the water content of the soils. These FEI results corroborates that modeling approaches to determine the global agriculture-derived NO emissions should take into consideration the main factors that regulate the NO emission at the scale of functional units with similar climate, soil and management conditions instead of expressing it as a percentage of the fertilizer applied. In our sandy loam savanna soils these factors are inorganic nitrogen content, pH and WFPS.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is an important trace gas and regulator of atmospheric photochemistry. Theory suggests moist soils optimize NO emissions, whereas wet or dry soils constrain them. In drylands, however, NO emissions can be greatest in dry soils and when dry soils are rewet. To understand how aridity and vegetation interact to generate this pattern, we measured NO fluxes in a California grassland, where wemanipulated vegetation cover and the length of the dry season and measured [delta(15)-N]NO and [delta(18)-O] NO following rewetting with N-15-labeled substrates. Plant N uptake reduced NO emissions by limiting N availability. In the absence of plants, soil N pools increased and NO emissions more than doubled. In dry soils, NO-producing substrates concentrated in hydrologically disconnected microsites. Upon rewetting, these concentrated N pools underwent rapid abiotic reaction, producing large NO pulses. Biological processes did not substantially contribute to the initial NO pulse but governed NO emissions within 24 h postwetting. Plants acted as an N sink, limiting NO emissions under optimal soil moisture. When soils were dry, however, the shutdown in plant N uptake, along with the activation of chemical mechanisms and the resuscitation of soil microbial processes upon rewetting, governed N loss. Aridity and vegetation interact to maintain a leaky N cycle during periods when plant N uptake is low, and hydrologically disconnected soils favor both microbial and abiotic NO-producing mechanisms. Under increasing rates of atmospheric N deposition and intensifying droughts, NO gas evasion may become an increasingly important pathway for ecosystem N loss in drylands.

AB Rains at the end of the dry season can trigger increases in emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide from forest and pasture soils in the Amazon Basin. The relative importance of the rain-stimulated emissions in the seasonal and annual budgets of these nitrogen gases for forests and pastures in the western Amazon is not well established. We measured soil emissions of NO and N2O from a forest and two pastures, 11 and 26 years old, after a simulated rain event. Wetting the soil resulted in very small pulses of NO or N2O from forest soils and no significant NO or N2O pulses from the pastures. We estimated that in the forest, the amounts of each gas emitted from pulses during the dry to wet transition period represented 3.4% of the NO and 1.8% of the N2O dry-season emissions, but amounted to less than 2% of the annual emissions of either gas. Total N oxide emissions of 5.6 kg N/ha/yr from the forest were nearly evenly divided between NO (42%) and N2O (58%). The emissions of NO were evenly distributed over the wet and dry seasons, while over 84% N2O fluxes occurred during the wet season.

AB We have investigated a subset of restoration practices applied to a degraded pasture at Fazenda Nova Vida, a 22 000 ha cattle ranch in Rondonia, Brazil. Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from soils were measured in conventional tillage and current pasture sites to assess N and C losses. Mean daily NO emissions from tilled plots were at least twice those from the pasture. Nitric oxide emissions from the tilled sites showed a strong diurnal pattern, while those from the pasture sites did not. Mean daytime NO emissions from the tilled sites were 9.7 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1), while mean nighttime emissions were 29.7 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1). In the pasture sites, NO emissions were 7.6 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1) during the day, and 7.7 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1) at night. Surface soil temperature was a good inverse predictor (r(2) = 0.75) of NO emissions from the tilled sites. Carbon dioxide emissions from the tilled sites were generally larger than CO2 emissions from the pasture sites. The mean CO2 emission rate from the tilled sites was 179 mg C m(-2) h(-1), while it was 123 mg C m(-2) h(-1) from the pasture sites. There was no distinct diurnal pattern for CO2 emissions. We found that the very high temperatures measured at the soil surface in the tillage plots, in the range of 40 - 45 degreesC, reduced the rate of NO emission. The reduction in NO emissions may be because of the sensitivity of autotrophic nitrifiers to high temperatures. This study provides insights on how land-use change may alter regional NO fluxes by exposing certain microbial communities to extreme environmental conditions. Future studies of NO emissions in tropical agricultural systems where soils are bare for extend periods need to make diurnal measurements or the daily fluxes will be substantially underestimated.

The profiles were measured at lysimeters filled with Andosol soil and fertilized with ammonium sulfate at rate of 200 kgNha(-1), incorporating to plow layer (Hirose & Tsuruta, 1996). In this model, diffusion of gases in soil followed Fick's law and the diffusion coefficient was adopted from Sallam et al. (1984). The gas production rate was set up at constant value in the site of gas production, and the gaseous consumption followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. By changing only the depth of NO and N2O production in soil in this model, we obtained the following results.
   (1) When the depth of gas production was set at near the soil surface (NO: 0-10 cm, N2O: 0-8 cm), the emission rates of both gases corresponded with the results of the lysimeter-measurement.
   (2) When the depth of gas production was shifted down 10 cm deeper (NO: 10-20 cm, N2O: 10-18 cm), the gas emission rate of NO decreased to 1.3% of (1), while that of N2O was almost the same as (1).
   (3) In the case that the total intensity of produced gases was not changed from (1) or (2), but that the extent of gas productions expanded 3 times wider (NO: 0-30 cm, N2O: 0-24 cm) than (1) or (2), the emission rates of NO and N2O became 26% and 95% of (1), respectively.
   The above results suggest the possibility of mitigating NO emission by setting the site of gaseous production in deeper soil, e.g. by means of deep application of fertilizer.

AB Sophisticated laboratory equipment and procedures are developed and used in controlled experiments to measure nitric oxide (NO) emissions ranging from 42 to 75 ng N/m(2) . s from sludge-amended soil of concern to environmental engineers because nitric oxide emitted to the troposphere is a precursor to troublesome ozone formation and also of concern to agricultural engineers because valuable nitrogen as fertilizer is lost from the soil. Water-filled pore space is confirmed to be of critical importance to NO flux, and the upper layers of soil are determined to contribute the larger portion of the NO fluxing from the soil to the troposphere. More than 42% of the total NO flux comes from the top 1 cm of soil, with NO contributions decreasing exponentially with soil depth and very little if any tropospheric NO contributed from soil at a depth of 20 cm or greater. The results are discussed in terms of microbiological, chemical, and soil transport processes that influence NO flux from sludge-amended soil.

AB Agricultural and forest soils with low organic C content and high alkalinity were studied over 17 days to investigate the potential response of the atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO) and the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) on (1) increased N deposition rates to forest soil; (2) different fertilizer types to agricultural soil and (3) a simulated rain event to forest and agricultural soils. Cumulative forest soil NO emissions (148-350 ng NO-N g(-1)) were similar to 4 times larger than N2O emissions (37-69 ng N2O-N g(-1)). Contrary, agricultural soil NO emissions (21-376 ng NO-N g(-1)) were similar to 16 times smaller than N2O emissions (45-8491 ng N2O-N g(-1)). Increasing N deposition rates 10 fold to 30 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), doubled soil NO emissions and NO(3)(-)concentrations. As such high N deposition rates are not atypical in China, more attention should be paid on forest soil NO research. Comparing the fertilizers urea, ammonium nitrate, and urea coated with the urease inhibitor 'Agrotain (R),' demonstrated that the inhibitor significantly reduced NO and N2O emissions. This is an unintended, not well-known benefit, because the primary function of Agrotain (R) is to reduce emissions of the atmospheric pollutant ammonia. Simulating a climate change event, a large rainfall after drought, increased soil NO and N2O emissions from both agricultural and forest soils. Such pulses of emissions can contribute significantly to annual NO and N2O emissions, but currently do not receive adequate attention amongst the measurement and modeling communities.

AB A modeling study revealed that the depth of nitric oxide (NO) production in soil is crucial for its flux, while that of nitrous oxide (N2O) is not. To verify this result, laboratory experiments with soil columns classified as Andisol (Hydric Hapludand) were conducted, with changing the depth of urea application, at 0-0.1 or 0.1-0.2 m. All the NO concentration profiles in soil exhibited a sharp peak at each fertilized layer within 5 days of fertilizer application. NO concentration in soil decreased abruptly as the distance from the fertilized layer increased. These findings imply that NO is produced mainly within the fertilized layer, but does not diffuse widely in the soil columns, because of rapid NO uptake within the soil. As a result, the NO flux from soil columns fertilized at 0.1-0.2 m depth over the 48-day study period was reduced to almost the same rate as that of the unfertilized one. The total NO emissions from soil columns unfertilized and fertilized at 0-0.1 and 0.1-0.2 m depth were 0.02, 1.39 (+/- 0.05) and 0.05 (+/- 0.03) kg N ha(-1), respectively, suggesting that NO emission derived from N fertilizer could be reduced to 2% by shifting the depth of fertilizer application by 0.1 m. On the other hand, soil N2O concentration profiles exhibited a gentler peak, because of the lower uptake by soil. N2O fluxes were affected more by the soil conditions, e. g. soil water content, than the distance between fertilized depth and soil surface. The total N2O emissions from soil columns unfertilized and fertilized at 0-0.1 and 0.1-0.2 m were 0.02, 0.16 (+/- 0.03) and 0.25 (+/- 0.04) kg N ha(-1), respectively.

AB The number of published N2O and NO emissions measurements is increasing steadily, providing additional information about driving factors of these emissions and allowing an improvement of statistical N-emission models. We summarized information from 1008 N2O and 189 NO emission measurements for agricultural fields, and 207 N2O and 210 NO measurements for soils under natural vegetation. The factors that significantly influence agricultural N2O emissions were N application rate, crop type, fertilizer type, soil organic C content, soil pH and texture, and those for NO emissions include N application rate, soil N content and climate. Compared to an earlier analysis the 20% increase in the number of N2O measurements for agriculture did not yield more insight or reduced uncertainty, because the representation of environmental and management conditions in agro-ecosystems did not improve, while for NO emissions the additional measurements in agricultural systems did yield a considerable improvement. N2O emissions from soils under natural vegetation are significantly influenced by vegetation type, soil organic C content, soil pH, bulk density and drainage, while vegetation type and soil C content are major factors for NO emissions. Statistical models of these factors were used to calculate global annual emissions from fertilized cropland (3.3 Tg N2O-N and 1.4 Tg NO-N) and grassland (0.8 Tg N2O-N and 0.4 Tg NO-N). Global emissions were not calculated for soils under natural vegetation due to lack of data for many vegetation types.

AB Croplands contribute to atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), but very limited data are available about NO fluxes from intensively managed croplands in China. In this study, NO fluxes were measured in a typical vegetable field planted with flowering Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. Chinensis var. utilis Tsen et Lee), which is the most widely cultivated vegetable in Guangdong province, south China. NO emission drastically increased after nitrogen fertilizer application, and other practices involving loosening the soil also enhanced NO emission. Mean NO emission flux was 47.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1) over a complete growth cycle. Annual NO emission from the vegetable field was about 10.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Fertilizer-induced NO emission factor was estimated to be 2.4%. Total NO emission from vegetable fields in Guangdong province was roughly estimated to be 11.7GgNyr(-1) based on the vegetable field area and annual No emission rate, and to bel 13.3GgNyr(-1) based on fertilizer-induced NO emission factor and background NO emission. This means that NO emission from vegetable fields was approximately 6% of NOx from commercial energy consumption in Guangdong province. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we report the impacts woodland savanna burning has on the soil trace gas fluxes in seasonally dry woodland savannas in Burkina Faso. We measured nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes at two ongoing long-term experimental sites (Tiogo and Dinderesso), each included three fire-exclusion plots and four annually burnt plots (0.24-0.25 ha plot size). We measured soil trace gas fluxes using chamber methods before and after fire during the dry season and at the start of and during the wet season. There was considerable volatilization of aboveground biomass C and N during fire, but soil N2O, NO, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were not significantly influenced following fire events. Instead, soil moisture dynamics were more important in regulating soil CO2 and N2O emissions. The onset of the wet season induced a short-term pulse of N2O emissions, when water-filled pore space exceeded 60%. We also detected a short-term pulse of NO emissions, lasting only four hours, following fire. The low soil N-oxide fluxes reflected the sites' extremely low inorganic N levels in the soil.

AB Soils, and here specifically acidic forest soils exposed to high rates of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, are a significant source for the secondary greenhouse gas nitric oxide (NO). However, as flux estimates are mainly based on measurements during the vegetation period, annual NO emissions budgets may hold uncertainty as cold season soil NO fluxes have rarely been quantified. Here we analyzed cold season soil NO fluxes and potential environmental drivers on the basis of the most extensive database on forest soil NO fluxes obtained at the Hoglwald Forest, Germany, spanning the years 1994 to 2010. On average, the cold season (daily average air temperature < 3 degrees C) contributed to 22% of the annual soil NO budget, varying from 13% to 41% between individual cold seasons. Temperature was the main controlling factor of the cold season NO fluxes, whereas during freeze-thaw cycles soil moisture availability determined NO emission rates. The importance of cold season soil NO fluxes for annual NO fluxes depended positively on the length of the cold season, but responded negatively to frost events. Snow cover did not significantly affect cold season soil NO fluxes. Cold season NO fluxes significantly correlated with cold season soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. During freeze-thaw periods strong positive correlations between NO and N2O fluxes were observed, though stimulation of NO fluxes by freeze-thaw was by far less pronounced as compared to N2O. Except for freeze-thaw periods NO fluxes significantly exceeded those for N2O during the cold season period. We conclude that in temperate forest ecosystems cold season NO emissions can contribute substantially to the annual NO budget and this contribution is significantly higher in years with long lasting but mild (less frost events) cold seasons.

AB Gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced by biological reactions in the soil not only affects air quality and atmospheric ozone concentration but also cause global warming and acid rain. Soil NOx emissions mainly come from soil microbial processes, but there is little evidence that the photocatalytic activities of inorganic minerals in the soil would affect the NOx transformation. This work studied the effect of soil types, red soil particle sizes, application of urea, and the organic matter content on the NO degradation efficiency and NO2 production, demonstrated that NOx exchange in soils by photochemical reactions and the degradation activity of NO varied widely amongst different soil types. The red soil has an obvious photocatalytic oxidation effect on 1 ppm NO in the air (removal efficiency reaches 24%), and the selectivity for ion species is close to 100%. Soil oxidizes extraneous NO under visible light, it can also oxidize the intrinsic nitrogen-containing compounds into NO2 to contribute emissions in the atmosphere. The ferric oxide could be important for the color of red soil, but its mixture with other minerals is more important for photocatalysis. This nitrogen conversion mechanism provides an alternative pathway for soil NO2 emissions and a new perspective for the nitrogen cycle.

AB Wetting dry soil triggers emission of nitric oxide (NO), which can harm air quality and influence ecosystem N balance. NO released after wetting may be derived from two primary mechanisms: (1) abiotic decomposition of nitrite (NO2-) present in the dry soil and (2) biologically-mediated production of NO. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to NO emission are challenging to partition. To differentiate the two mechanisms, we made continuous observations of NO emission from a range of soils that varied in texture, pH, and exchangeable cations. We coupled NO gas exchange measurements with automated, non-destructive high-resolution sampling of inorganic N species via microdialysis. We identified two distinct phases of NO production (1) an initial phase that reached its maximum less than 30 min after rewetting; and (2) a second phase lasting up to 36 h. The magnitude of the initial phase of NO production was correlated with the initial nitrous acid concentration (calculated from NO2- concentrations and soil pH) and soil exchangeable calcium. The second phase of NO emission coincided with a peak in NO2- that preceded NO3- accumulation. Together, these results suggest that NO emissions following wetting are defined by an initial pulse of abiotic NO formation mediated by soil acidity at mineral surfaces, followed by a prolonged pulse of NO emission driven by a lag between the biological processes of ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation. These results can inform mechanistic models of NO emissions from soils to improve predictions of the terrestrial N cycle and atmospheric chemistry.

AB During September and October 1999, dynamic chamber measurements were carried out to determine nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from a primary forest soil and an old pasture in the Brazilian Amazon basin as part of the project "European Studies of Trace Gases and Atmospheric Chemistry as a Contribution to the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia" (LBA-EUSTACH). In addition, soil samples were collected from these two sites, and laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the NO production and consumption rate constants as functions of soil temperature and soil moisture. These laboratory results were converted into NO fluxes using a simple algorithm, which required additional information on the gas diffusion in soil, the soil bulk density, and the field conditions (soil temperature and soil moisture). Over the entire measurement period, the calculated and measured NO fluxes agreed well both for the forest (6.9 +/- 2.9 and 5.0 +/- 4.6 ng m(-2) s(-1), respectively) and for the pasture (0.67 +/- 0.09 and 0.65 +/- 0.37 ng m(-2) s(-1), respectively). Forest to pasture conversion decreased NO production and gas diffusion and resulted in smaller NO fluxes from pasture than forest soil.

AB This experiment was conducted in maize field plots to study the effects of N-fertilizer management on nitrogen oxide emissions, soil microbial activities and crop yield, and the relationships among them in a Japanese Andisol. N fertilization increased both nitrification and dehydrogenase activities in soil and the emissions of NO and NO. Nitrification and dehydrogenase activities showed a close relationship with the NO emission, while the relationship with the N2O emission was not significant. Deep application (8 cm) of N fertilizer generally decreased both nitrification activity and NO emission. Controlled release of N fertilizer decreased the dehydrogenase activity and up to 86% of the NO emission. Our findings indicate the possibility that the low biological NO production in soil by deep application and controlled release of N fertilizer contributed to the low NO emission. Application of controlled release N fertilizer significantly increased the grain yield and N uptake by grain. NO emission showed a negative relationship with maize yield as affected by N-fertilizer management, suggesting the possibility of mitigating NO emission from Andisols without reducing crop production.

AB Conventional nitrogen fertilization in a maize cropping system enhances the soil's methane (CH4) sink but exacerbates emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). This study demonstrates that conventional nitrogen application (UN) increased CH4 uptake by 154%, while elevating N2O and NO emissions by 190% and 301%, respectively, compared to zero nitrogen plots (N0). Fertilization fundamentally reconfigured the regulatory mechanisms governing gas fluxes: under UN, fluxes were controlled by a complex interplay of nitrogen substrates, carbon availability, moisture, and temperature, whereas under N0, CH4 uptake exhibited significantly enhanced temperature sensitivity (with Q10 increasing from 1.06 to 7.54) and nitrogen oxide emissions became more dependent on native ammonium and extractable organic carbon. Crucially, nitrogen withdrawal reduced soil ammonium by 37.1% without altering non-nitrogen soil properties, including temperature, moisture, and labile carbon pools. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the concept of nitrogen saturation under conventional fertilization rates. Optimizing these rates presents a significant opportunity to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution while improving nitrogen use efficiency, thereby aligning agricultural production with climate goals and public health objectives without destabilizing short-term soil function.

AB Low gas diffusivity of the litter layer is held responsible for high seasonal nitrous oxide (N2O) and low nitric oxide (NO) emissions from acid beech forest soils with moder type humus. The objectives were (i) to evaluate whether these beech forest soils generally exhibit high seasonal N2O emissions and (ii) to assess the influence of gas diffusivity and nitrogen (N) mineralisation on N oxide fluxes.
   We measured N2O and NOx (NO + NO2) fluxes in six German beech stands and determined net N turnover rates and gas diffusivity of soil samples taken at each chamber.
   High N2O emissions (up to 113 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) were only observed at one beech stand. Net nitrification of the organic layer and soil gas diffusivity explained 77 % of the variation in N2O fluxes (P = 0.001). Fluxes of NOx were low (-6.3 to 12.3 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and appeared to be controlled by NOx concentrations in the forest air.
   Low soil gas diffusivity and high N turnover rates promoted high N2O losses in times of high soil respiration but were not necessarily associated with moder type humus. High seasonal emissions are probably less common in German beech forests than previously assumed.

AB Efforts to reduce tropospheric ozone (O(3)) pollution in the southeastern United States by reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds have had only modest success, and attention is now being drawn to sources of nitrogen oxide (NO(x)), which is the other major precursor of photochemical production of O(3). Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) from the soils of this region are poorly known. In this study, we adapt the CASA model of terrestrial-ecosystem productivity and trace-gas emissions to make spatially gridded, monthly estimates of NO emissions from soils for a nine-state region of the southeastern United States. Gridded input data layers to the model include temperature, precipitation, solar surface radiation, soil texture, land cover, fertilizer sales by county, and normalized-difference vegetation index. Total. N gas emissions are modeled as proportional to the rates of gross N mineralization and fertilizer N input. The relative proportional emissions of NO, N(2)O, and N(2) are determined by soil water content. The model estimates 126 x 10(9) g NO-N/yr emitted from soils for the entire nine-state area. Agricultural soils emit two-thirds of the total but cover only similar to 17% of the land area. Highest NO emissions occur along the cultivated Mississippi River corridor, southern Alabama-Georgia, and the Carolina coastal plain. Simulated emissions fall within the range of commonly reported values for temperate forests and cultivated fields, and the regional estimates are probably accurate within a factor of 2. Compared to NO(x) emissions from industrial, transportation, and utility sectors, soil emissions are similar to 10% of total regional emissions. However, the soil source could be a significant fraction of local NO(x) in rural agricultural areas, where emissions from fertilized fields usually range from 300 to 900 mg NO-N . m(-2).yr(-1). Fertilizer management could be an effective O(3)-abatement strategy in some rural agricultural areas, although this possibility and general uncertainties in the soil source of NO should not be grounds to delay other O(3)-abatement strategies for the much larger, nonsoil NO(x) sources in the region.

AB The surface flux of nitric oxide from a wheat field was investigated from 23 March to 29 May 1997 in the Kerzersmoos, Switzerland. A plot fertilised with 19 kg N ha(-)1 in cattle slurry and 40 kg N ha(-1) in mineral NH4NO3 fertiliser and a plot receiving no nitrogen containing fertiliser were compared. The flux was calculated based on hourly measurements of the NO soil-atmosphere concentration gradient using the one-dimensional soil diffusion model of Galbally and Johansson (1989). The soil bulk diffusion coefficient was determined from measurements of the Rn-222 surface flux and the activity gradient between 10 cm depth and the surface. It ranged between 79% and 0.3% of the NO diffusion coefficient in air and was parameterised by air filled soil pore space. The indirectly determined NO flux agreed well with standard flux measurements using dynamic chambers. The largest NO emission was found following fertiliser application and irrigation. The emission occurred in pulses, which lasted for 4 days up to 3 weeks coinciding with elevated soil ammonium concentrations. Nitric oxide emission in 5 days following application of cattle slurry were 31 g NO-N ha(-)1 and 5 g NO-N ha(-1) from the non-fertilised plot, respectively. Nitric oxide emission in 15 days following application of NH4NO3 was 95 g NO-N ha(-1) and 10 g NO-N ha(-1) from the non-fertilised plot, respectively. NO emission in 4 days following irrigation on 21 April were 36 g N ha(-1) from the fertilised and 39 g N ha(-1) from the non-fertilised plot. The daily NO emission before and after fertiliser and irrigation pulses was between 0.3 and 0.7 g NO-N ha(-1) d(-1). NO production and NO uptake of the soil was measured regularly. No systematic influence of management or climate on NO uptake was found. NO production was strongly stimulated by fertiliser input and soil moisture content. The simulation of NO production could be reproduced using a nitrification algorithm (Riedo et al., 1998) driven by soil temperature, moisture and ammonium concentration. A NO production rate constant of 1.1.10(-3) h(-1) at 15 degrees C was derived from a linear regression between nitrification and NO production. Introducing the parameterisation of NO production into the model of Galbally and Johansson (1989) the duration and the strength of the NO emission pulses could be reproduced and the total NO emission during the experiment was approximated within a factor of two.

AB Modeling of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions is highly uncertain and may misrepresent its spatial and temporal distribution. This study builds upon a recently introduced parameterization to improve the timing and spatial distribution of soil NO emission estimates in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The parameterization considers soil parameters, meteorology, land use, and mineral nitrogen (N) availability to estimate NO emissions. We incorporate daily year-specific fertilizer data from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agricultural model to replace the annual generic data of the initial parameterization, and use a 12 km resolution soil biome map over the continental USA. CMAQ modeling for July 2011 shows slight differences in model performance in simulating fine particulate matter and ozone from Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) and Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) sites and NO2 columns from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite retrievals. We also simulate how the change in soil NO emissions scheme affects the expected O-3 response to projected emissions reductions.

AB As intensive vegetable cultivation is rapidly expanding in China and elsewhere worldwide, its environmental consequences on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions deserve attention. We measured N2O and NO fluxes simultaneously for a full year from Chinese subtropical vegetable fields. Clearly, both N2O and NO emissions varied greatly in different vegetable crop seasons within a year, highlighting the importance of whole-year measurement for achieving temporally accurate annual direct emission factors. A revised "hole-in-the-pipe" model well described quantitative relationships between N2O plus NO fluxes and soil-specific conditions. Annual background N2O and NO emissions were 0.73-5.0 and 0.26-0.56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, for the vegetable cultivations. The farmers' fertilization practice increased N2O and NO emissions. Annual direct emission factors for greenhouse and conventional vegetable fields, respectively, were 1.1% and 1.9% for N2O, and 0.36% and 0.32% for NO, indicating there is a need to consider a differentiation of emission factors for managed vegetable cultivations.

AB Soil is recognized as an important source of atmospherically reactive gases, especially in agricultural soils. Nonetheless, there is scarcity of research estimating reactive nitrogen gas (Nr) emissions from agricultural soils at the regional to global scale. In this study, we examined nitrous acid (HONO) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from seven representative agricultural soils in Guangdong Province, considering soil moisture and temperature, using a dynamic chamber system. Accordingly, empirical formulas for HONO and NO emissions for each soil in relation to moisture and temperature were developed. Utilizing these empirical formulas, specific land data, and fertilizer data, we estimated the annual HONO and NO emission fluxes from agricultural soils in Guangdong Province to be 97.41 and 37.08 Gg N yr(-1), respectively. Their total quantity is equivalent to 12% of the 2017 NOx emission inventory for Guangdong Province, potentially exerting significant impacts on the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and regional air quality.

AB Tropical soils are important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from the Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. Clearing of tropical rainforest for pasture has the potential to alter N2O and NO emissions from soils by altering moisture, nitrogen supply or other factors that control N oxide production. In this review we report annual rates of N2O and NO emissions from forest and pastures of different ages in the western Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia and examine how forest clearing alters the major controls of N oxide production. Forests had annual N2O emissions of 1.7 to 4.3 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and annual NO emissions of 1.4 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). Young pastures of 1-3 years old had higher N2O emissions than the original forest (3.1-5.1 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) but older pastures of 6 years or more had lower emissions (0.1 to 0.4 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Both soil moisture and indices of soil N cycling were relatively poor predictors of N2O, NO and combined N2O + NO emissions. In forest, high N2O emissions occurred at soil moistures above 30% water-filled pore space, while NO emissions occurred at all measured soil moistures (18-43%). In pastures, low N availability led to low N2O and NO emissions across the entire range of soil moistures. Based on these patterns and results of field fertilization experiments, we concluded that: (1) nitrification was the source of NO from forest soils, (2) denitrification was not a major source of N2O production from forest soils or was not limited by NO3- supply, (3) denitrification was a major source of N2O production from pasture soils but only when NO3- was available, and (4) nitrification was not a major source of NO production in pasture soils. Pulse wettings after prolonged dry periods increased N2O and NO emissions for only short periods and not enough to appreciably affect annual emission rates. We project that Basin-wide, the effect of clearing for pasture in the future will be a small reduction in total N2O emissions if the extensive pastures of the Amazon continue to be managed in a way similar to current practices. In the future, both N2O and NO fluxes could increase if uses of pastures change to include greater use of N fertilizers or N-fixing crops. Predicting the consequences of these changes for N oxide production will require an understanding of how the processes of nitrification and denitrification interact with soil type and regional moisture regimes to control N2O and NO production from these new anthropogenic N sources.

AB Measurements of nitric oxide (NO) emission from a typical Chinese rice-wheat rotation are continuously made during the non-waterlogged period by using an automatic system based on static chamber techniques. A positive correlation exists between NO emission and soil moisture content when surface soil temperature is > 20 degreesC. The diurnal variability in NO emission is characterized with day-peak, night-peak and irregular patterns, which are in close association with wheat growth. The diurnal NO emission under the day-peak pattern is correlated with the simultaneously observed surface soil temperature, whereas that under the night-peak and irregular pattern is dependent on surface soil temperature at 7 +/- 2 and 3 +/- 2 h before NO observation, respectively. The effect of soil temperature on NO emission is well described by F = alpha.e (beta.T), where F is NO flux, T soil temperature, and alpha and beta empirical coefficients. The parameter Q(10); that is, the change in NO emission per 10 degreesC soil temperature, is correlated with the rates of fertilizer-N application. An approach orientated from the Arrhenius equation, F = e(k)e(-Ea/(R.TK)) + e(k)e(-Ea/(R.DeltaTK)) sin[(t-6-tau)/12pi], is developed in order to predict diurnal NO emission, where T(K) is the daily average soil temperature, DeltaT(K) the deviation of soil temperature from the daily average, E(a) the apparent activation energy, R the gas constant, t a given time within the one-day cycle, tau delayed time for appearance of the diurnal NO emission peak, and k an empirical coefficient. Based on the results, the authors recommend that intermittent measurement of NO emission from a similar ecosystem would be best taken around 17:00. The molar ratio of NO/N(2)O over the non-waterlogged period is > 1 when soil moisture content was less than the field capacity, suggesting that NO emission was mainly derived from nitrification under this condition.

AB Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) have been identified as one of the most important sources of atmospheric pollution from grasslands. Soils are major sources for the production of N2O and NO, which are by-products or intermediate products of microbial nitrification and denitrification processes. Some studies have tried to evaluate the importance of denitrification or nitrification in the formation of N2O or NO but there are few that have considered emissions of both gases as affected by a wide range of different factors. In this study, the importance of a number of factors (soil moisture, fertiliser type and temperature) was determined for N2O and NO emissions. Nitrous oxide and NO evolution in time and the possibility of using the ratio NO:N2O as an indicator for the processes involved were also explored. Dinitrogen (ND and ammonia (NH3) emissions were estimated and a mass balance for N fluxes was performed. Nitrous oxide and NO were produced by nitrification and denitrification in soils fertilised with NH4+ and by denitrification in soils fertilised with NO3-. Water content in the soil was the most important factor affecting N2O and NO emissions. Our N2O and NO data were fitted to quadratic (r = 0.8) and negative exponential (r = 0.7) equations, respectively. A long lag phase was observed for the N2O emitted from soils fertilised with NO3- (denitrification), which was not observed for the soils fertilised with NH4+ (nitrification) and was possibly due to a greater inhibiting effect of low temperatures on microbial activity controlling denitrification rather than on nitrification. The use of the NO:N2O ratio as a possible indicator of denitrification or nitrification in the formation of N2O and NO was discounted for soils fertilised with NO3-. The N mass balance indicated that about 50 kg N ha(-1) was immobilised by microorganisms and/or taken up by plant roots, and that most of the losses ocurred in wet soils (WFPS > 60%) as N-2 and NH3 losses (> 55%).

AB Factors controlling NO production, consumption, and emission rates were examined in an organic soil. Emission rates were measured in the enclosed headspaces of intact soil cores under three fertilisation treatments (unfertilised or 100 kg N ha(-1) as NH4Cl or as NaNO3), with and without the nitrification inhibitor C2H2 (20-70 mu l l(-1)). Nitrification was always the main source of NO emitted across the soil surface, even when the soil was nearly saturated. Fertilisation of soil with NH4Cl increased NO emission both by stimulating NO production from nitrification, and by decreasing the NO consumption rate constant. Addition of NaNO3 also stimulated the production of NO and N2O during nitrification in aerobic soil slurry experiments. This effect was eliminated by adding C2H2 and was therefore not related to denitrification. In loose soil samples, the increase in NO-N production after NH4Cl addition represented as much as 26% of the added N. However, in intact cores, 95% of the NO produced through nitrification was oxidised within the soil column rather than emitted to the atmosphere. We concluded that nitrification is the primary NO source from this organic soil, that surface NO emissions are much lower than gross NO production rates, and that gaseous N oxide (NO and N2O) losses during nitrification can be affected by both soil NH4+ and NO3-.

AB Soil drying and wetting cycles can produce pulses of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions with substantial effects on both regional air quality and Earth's climate. While pulsed production of N emissions is ubiquitous across ecosystems, the processes governing pulse magnitude and timing remain unclear. We studied the processes producing pulsed NO and N2O emissions at two contrasting drylands, desert and chaparral, where despite the hot and dry conditions known to limit biological processes, some of the highest NO and N2O flux rates have been measured. We measured N2O and NO emissions every 30 min for 24 h after wetting soils with isotopically-enriched nitrate and ammonium solutions to determine production pathways and their timing. Nitrate was reduced to N2O within 15 min of wetting, with emissions exceeding 1000 ng N-N2O m(-2) s(-1) and returning to background levels within four hours, but the pulse magnitude did not increase in proportion to the amount of ammonium or nitrate added. In contrast to N2O, NO was emitted over 24 h and increased in proportion to ammonium addition, exceeding 600 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1) in desert and chaparral soils. Isotope tracers suggest that both ammonia oxidation and nitrate reduction produced NO. Taken together, our measurements demonstrate that nitrate can be reduced within minutes of wetting summer-dry desert soils to produce large N2O emission pulses and that multiple processes contribute to long-lasting NO emissions. These mechanisms represent substantial pathways of ecosystem N loss that also contribute to regional air quality and global climate dynamics.

AB Species composition in successional dry forests in the tropics varies widely, but the effect of this variation on biogeochemical processes is not well known. We examined fluxes of N oxides (nitrous and nitric oxide), soil N cycling, and litter chemistry (C/N ratio) in four successional dry forests on similar soils in western Puerto Rico with differing species compositions and land-use histories. Forests patch-cut for charcoal 60 years ago had few legumes, high litter C/N ratios, low soil nitrate and low N oxide fluxes. In contrast, successional forests from pastures abandoned several decades ago had high legume densities, low litter C/N ratios, high mean soil nitrate concentrations and high N oxide fluxes. These post-pasture forests were dominated by the naturalized legume Leuceana leucocephala, which was likely responsible for the rapid N cycling in those forests. We conclude that agriculturally induced successional pathways leading to dominance by a legume serve as a mechanism for increasing N oxide emissions from tropical regions. As expected for dry regions, nitric oxide dominated total N oxide emissions. Nitric oxide emissions increased with increasing soil moisture up to about 30% water-filled pore space then stabilized, while nitrous oxide emissions, albeit low, continued to increase with increasing soil wetness. Inorganic N pools and net N mineralization were greatest during peak rainfalls and at the post-agricultural site with the highest fluxes. Soil nitrate and the nitrate/ammonium ratio correlated positively with average N oxide fluxes. N oxide fluxes were negatively and exponentially related to litter C/N ratio for these dry forests and the relationship was upheld with the addition of data from seven wet forests in northeastern Puerto Rico. This finding suggests that species determination of litter C/N ratio may partly determine N oxide fluxes across widely differing tropical environments.

AB Soils are a major source of nitrogen oxides, which in the atmosphere help govern its oxidative capacity. Thus the response of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions to forcings such as warming or forest loss has a meaningful impact on global atmospheric chemistry. We find that the soil emission rate of NO in Amazonia from a common inventory is biased low by at least an order of magnitude in comparison to tower-based observations. Accounting for this regional bias decreases the modeled global methane lifetime by 1.4%-2.6%. In comparison, a fully deforested Amazonia, representing a 37% decrease in global emissions of isoprene, decreases methane lifetime by at most 4.6%, highlighting the sensitive response of oxidation rates to changes in emissions of NO compared to those of terpenes. Our results demonstrate that improving our understanding of soil NO emissions will yield a more accurate representation of atmospheric oxidative capacity.
   Soils emit a gas called nitric oxide (NO). The amount of NO emitted from soils in tropical forests is not well known, but has been assumed to be small. We simulated how different amounts of NO emissions from soils in the Amazon impacted atmospheric chemistry. By comparing our modeled results to observations we found that NO emissions from soils in the Amazon may be between 10 and 20 times larger than the current default assumption. This matters because NO has a strong influence on the rate at which methane and other gasses are removed from the atmosphere. Therefore soil NO emissions end up impacting how long methane can last in the atmosphere, and that would have additional climate impacts. Even though soil NO emissions are smaller than other sources of NO emissions globally, we find that the amount of NO emitted in the Amazon matters a lot for how long methane can last in the atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that improving estimates of soil NO emissions is going to be necessary for making accurate estimates of how long methane and other reactive species will stay in the atmosphere.
   Soil emission rates of NO in common inventories may be between 10x and 20x too low over the Amazon basin Higher soil NO over the Amazon basin alters the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and decreases global methane lifetime by 1.4%-2.6% Global methane lifetime is more sensitive to Amazon soil NO fluxes than to the loss of terpene fluxes from total deforestation of the Amazon

AB Invasions of introduced species have homogenized ecological communities worldwide, leading to losses of native species and the services they provide. Some of these invaders substantially alter nutrient cycling, which changes conditions for all other organisms, but less is known about the potential influence of these species on nitrogen (N) trace gas emissions that affect atmospheric processes. We used a natural experiment to explore whether the establishment of an introduced nitrogen (N) fixing tree (Falcataria moluccana) and recent invasion of an amphibian predator, the Caribbean tree frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui), into native Hawaiian rainforests have affected soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), two atmospherically important trace gases produced by soil microorganisms. Soil N2O and NO emissions and rates of soil N cycling were significantly higher in F. moluccana-dominated stands compared to native Metrosideros polymorpha (Ohi'a) stands. Additionally, invasion of E. coqui frogs moderately increased soil N2O emissions, primarily in non-native F. moluccana forests where soil N availability was already elevated. N2O emissions were positively and significantly related to net potential N mineralization, and total N2O+NO fluxes increased with soil nitrate (NO3-) concentration and rates of nitrification. Previous work in these Hawaiian rainforest sites has shown that F. moluccana substantially increases N availability by increasing ecosystem N supply compared to uninvaded stands, and E. coqui accelerates N availability and litter decomposition, although moderately, due to enhanced fluxes of nutrient-rich waste products. Here, we show that acceleration of nutrient cycling by introduced species can also alter biosphere-atmosphere exchange of N-oxides.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems with their main elements soil and plants may act, in principle, as both source and sink for atmospheric nitric oxide (NO). The net exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere, however, is globally dominated by biogenic emissions of NO from soils. Consequently the soil-air exchange of NO is the focus of the following overview. Particular emphasis is placed on the major processes that are responsible for NO production in soils (nitrification, denitrification) and their regulation by environmental factors (nitrogen availability, soil water content, soil temperature, ambient NO concentration). It is shown that interactions of these factors are a major reason for the broad range that exists in published data on NO fluxes. This variability makes it difficult to predict the magnitude of NO fluxes on relevant spatial and temporal scales. To overcome the problem various generalization procedures for scaling up in space and time have been developed, and the potential and limitations of the different approaches is discussed.

AB Tropical and subtropical acidic soils have been well documented as hotspots of global soil nitrogen (N) oxide (i.e., nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions). While the effectiveness of possible mitigation options has been extensively examined in croplands, little is known about their effectiveness in reducing N-oxide emissions from acidic soils of rapidly expanding tea plantations in China. Here, we conducted a 2-year field experiment to investigate how organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer and biochar amendment affect soil N-oxide emissions from a subtropical tea plantation. Across the 2-year measurement period, full organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer significantly increased N2O emissions by an average of 17% while had a lower NO emission compared to synthetic fertilizer alone. Our global meta-analysis further revealed that full or partial organic fertilizer substitution resulted in a 29% (95% confidence interval: 5%-60%) increase of N2O emissions from acidic soils. In contrast, irrespective of fertilizer type, biochar amendment significantly reduced N2O emissions by 14% in the first but not second experimental year, suggesting a transient effect. The trade-off effect of full organic substitution on N2O and NO emissions may be attributed to the favorable conditions for N2O production due to the stimulated activity of nitrifiers and denitrifiers. The suppression of N2O emission following biochar amendment was probably due to promoted further reduction of N2O to dinitrogen. The fertilizer-induced emission factor (EF) of N2O (2.1%) in the tea plantation was greater than the current IPCC default value, but the EF of NO (0.8%) was comparable to the global estimate. Taken together, while biochar amendment could have mitigation potential, cautions are needed when applying organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer as mitigation options for acidic soils as hotspots of N-oxide emissions.

DT Article

AB Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) from agricultural soils in the tropics are important in the global budgets of these trace gases. We made monthly measurements of N2O and NO emissions from pastures with three different management systems on volcanic soils in northwestern Costa Rica: traditional (no N input from fertilizer or legumes), pastures with a grass-legume combination, and pastures fertilized with 300 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1). Average annual N2O emissions were 2.7 ng N cm(-2)h(-1) from the traditional pastures, 4.9 ng N cm(-2)h(-1) from the grass-legume pastures, and 25.8 ng N cm(-2)h(-1) from the fertilized pastures. Average annual NO emissions were 0.9, 1.3, and 5.3 ng N cm(-2)h(-1) from traditional, grass-legume and fertilized pastures, respectively. In a separate experiment the effects of ammonium, nitrate, and urea-based fertilizer mixtures on nitrogen oxide fluxes were compared. We measured nitrogen oxide fluxes following four different fertilization events. Nitrogen oxide fluxes were among the highest ever measured. The difference in soil water content between the fertilization events had a far greater effect on N2O and NO emissions than the effect of fertilizer composition. We conclude that the concept of "emission factors" for calculating N2O and NO emissions from different types of N fertilizer is flawed because environmental factors are more important than the type of N fertilizer. To estimate fertilizer-induced N2O emission in tropical agriculture, stratification according to soil moisture regime is more useful than stratification according to fertilizer composition.

AB There is a lack of information about the influence of tillage and time of sowing on N2O and NO emission in cereal production. Both factors influence crop growth and soil conditions and thereby can affect trace gas emissions from soils. We measured fluxes of NO and N2O in a tillage experiment where grassland on clay loam soil was converted to arable by either direct drilling or ploughing to 30 cm depth. We made measurements in spring for 20 days after fertilizer application to spring-sown and to winter-sown barley. Both were the second barley crop after grass. Direct drilling enhanced N2O emission primarily as a result of restricted gas diffusivity causing poor aeration after rainfall. Deep ploughing enhanced NO emission, because of the large air-filled porosity in the topsoil. NO and N2O emissions were smaller from winter sown crops than from spring sown crops.
   The three rates of N fertilizer application (40, 80 or 120 kg N ha(-1)) did not produce the expected linear response in either soil available N concentrations or in NO and N2O fluxes. We attributed this to the lack of rainfall in the ten-day period after fertilizer application and therefore very slow incorporation and movement of fertilizer into and through the soil.

AB Agricultural soil has been recognized as a major source of atmospheric NO and N2O emissions which have important impacts on regional and global environments. Here we comparably investigated the effects of ammonium, nitrate fertilizers and nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) addition on NO and N2O emissions from the agricultural soil in the North China Plain (NCP). Compared with the ammonium fertilizer application, the reductions of NO emissions caused by nitrate fertilizer and DCD addition were 100% and 93%, and of N2O emissions were 54% and 74%, respectively. Remarkable reductions of NO and N2O emissions were also observed from five different agricultural soils in the NCP by replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer, indicating that nitrification is the predominant process for the emissions of NO and N2O from the soils in the vast area of NCP. NO emission peaks were found to be several days later than N2O peaks after the application of ammonium fertilizer and flooding irrigation, implying that most of NO initially produced via nitrification process might be fast reduced to N2O under the high soil moisture condition. Interestingly, the relative contribution of denitrification to N2O emission showed obviously time-dependent, e.g., evident N2O emission caused by the application of nitrate was only observed after the basal fertilization for the maize and the top dressing for the wheat. Replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer and mixing with the nitrification inhibitor are verified to be effective measures for mitigating NO and N2O emissions from arable soils in the NCP.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive trace gas affecting atmospheric chemistry and air quality. Although forest soils have been recognized as an important source of atmospheric NO, there are large uncertainties in global forest soil NO emission inventories (ranged from 0.03 to 8.00 kg N ha(-1), averaged 1.34 +/- 0.28 kg N ha(-1)), partly due to the paucity of high-frequency monitoring from unmanaged forests. In this study, we used an automated sampling system to measure NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over two years (daily measurements from January 2019 to December 2020) in a mixed forest in Northeast China. We found that the mean annual NO emission was 0.42 +/- 0.04 kg N ha(-1), being 31% of the global forest average. The contribution of NO emission during the growing season was 92% of the yearly NO flux. Soil temperature was the most important edaphic factor in regulating NO emission, explaining 90-92% of the seasonal variation. The apparent temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of NO flux was 3.67. In the growing season, NO emission was also influenced by soil moisture, with optimum soil moisture of 37% WFPS. By providing a detailed measurement of diurnal, seasonal, and annual dynamics of NO emissions and their environmental controls from forest soils, our data are useful to develop more accurate biogeochemical models that will improve upscaled global NO budgets.

AB Urea is considered the cheapest and most commonly used form of inorganic N fertilizer worldwide. However, its use is associated with emissions of ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), which have both economic and environmental impact. Urease activity inhibitors have been proposed as a means to reduce NH3 emissions, although limited information exists about their effect on N2O and NO emissions. In this context, a field experiment was carried out with a barley crop (Hordeum vulgare L) under Mediterranean conditions to test the effectiveness of the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) on reducing these gaseous N losses from surface applied urea. Crop yield, soil mineral N concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), denitrification potential, NH3, N2O and NO fluxes were measured during the growing season. The inclusion of the inhibitor reduced NH3 emissions in the 30 d following urea application by 58% and net N2O and NO emissions in the 95 d following urea application by 86% and 88%, respectively. NBPT addition also increased grain yield by 5% and N uptake by 6%, although neither increase was statistically significant. Under the experimental conditions presented here, these results demonstrate the potential of the urease inhibitor NBPT in abating NH3, N2O and NO emissions from arable soils fertilized with urea, slowing urea hydrolysis and releasing lower concentrations of NH4+ to the upper soil layer.

TI NO emissions from soils in the southeastern United States
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
LA English
DT Article
ID NITRIC-OXIDE; NITROUS-OXIDE
AB Biogenic soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO) are important in the formation of tropospheric ozone (O-3) in the rural environment. This paper summarizes our recent estimates of soil NO emissions from a wide variety of sites in nine southeastern United States, A total of over 12,000 individual flux measurements was made from crop, pasture, and forests representing major physiographic regions within the southeast. These measurements were used to determine flux algorithms relating NO emissions from land types. Strong relationships were found between NO flux and temperature that explained over 80% of the variation in emissions. Using these relationships and Geographic Information Systems land base information for the states, calculated seasonal emissions for NO are reported. Crop land regulated regional soil NO emissions, accounting for 83% of the emissions in summer, 61% in spring, and 55% in fall, The summertime contribution of soil NO to the overall NO inventory, including anthropogenic sources, averaged 4.1% for the states, ranging from a high of 9.5% for Mississippi to a low of 2.2% for Florida. The importance of high summertime temperatures in controlling soil NO was evident in that emissions on a prototypical summer day were only one fifth the emissions of a hot (36 degrees C, maximum daily high) summer day. Comparisons of the algorithms we developed to those of the current model used by the Environmental Protection Agency, BEIS 2.2, showed reasonable agreement, that is, agreement within a factor of 2, given the inherent temporal and spatial variability of soil NO emissions.

AB Global annual NO emissions from soil are of the order of 10 Tg NO-N. This is about half the amount fossil fuel combustion processes contribute to the annual global NOx budget. Reducing the emissions of soil derived NOx requires an understanding of the source of the flux and the processes that determine its magnitude. A thorough investigation of possible mitigation strategies and the consequences of their implementation is also necessary. The ratio of NO and N2O emissions from soils can be used as an indicator of the dominant NO production pathway operating. Fertilizer application (rate, type and time of application), soil temperature, soil water content and soil management practices all affect the emission rate and are reviewed. Mitigation options include reduction in N fertilizer use through an increase in fertilizer use efficiency, preferential use of NH4NO3 instead of urea, improved timing of fertilizer application, the use of nitrification and urease inhibitors, improving the fertilizer uptake efficiency of crops in tropical agriculture and changes in land management. Several of the viable mitigation strategies, mainly those increasing fertilizer use efficiency, have the capacity to reduce global annual NO emissions by 4% (0.4 Tg NO-N y(-1)). For other strategies including use of inhibitors, changing cultivation or land use, the possible reductions are too uncertain to justify quantification on the basis of present knowledge.

AB Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) were measured during the summer of 1995 from 4 crops, located at three different sites throughout North Carolina. These sites were chosen to represent major physiographic regions of the Southeast US, in an effort to compare fluxes from different agriculturally managed soils. Emission rates were determined using a dynamic flow-through chamber system. In order to understand the NO flux from the different soil and crop types, measurements were made on corn and soybean crops in the coastal region, tobacco in the piedmont region, and corn in the upper piedmont region of North Carolina. Average NO fluxes were 5.5 +/- 2.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1), 20.7 +/- 19.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1), 4.1 +/- 1.4 ng N m(-2) s(-1), and 8.5 +/- 4.9 ng N m-2 s(-1) respectively for corn and soybean in the coastal region, tobacco in the piedmont region, and corn in the upper piedmont region. We were only able to detect an exponential dependence of NO flux on soil temperature at two of the locations. The composite data of all the research sites revealed a general trend of increasing NO flux with soil water content or increasing extractable nitrogen in the soil, however, the day to day variations within each site did not reveal the same trends. We feel that acquisition of a soil NO flux data set in this fashion, which consists of observations collected over different points in both space and time, makes attempts to model soil NO flux in terms of different soil parameters difficult.

AB When the effect of water content was minimized, soil CO2 evolution and soil organic matter content were good predictors of aerobic NO. uptake rate constants across a wide range of soil types. Field manure application to a Gleysol stimulated NO. uptake rate constants and lowered NO. compensation points compared to unfertilized or NH4NO3-fertilized soil. This effect lasted for months after manure application. In a laboratory experiment, addition of manure reduced the NO. efflux associated with nitrification of NH4Cl fertilizer, and manured soils had a greater capacity to remove NO. from polluted air. Evidence is presented that these observations result from NO. oxidation during heterotrophic microbial activity in soil.

AB In the present study, ammonia (NIL) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions were measured by the dynamic flux chamber (DFC) method from a cropland of Chinese cabbage over a one and a half month period (September-October, 2006). By applying a combination of three treatment M types (comprising different proportions of manure, urea, and NPK fertilizer) to the crop field, the effects of such treatments on emission flux were assessed in relation to the amount and type of fertilizer. The magnitude of NIL emission (mu g m(-2) h(-1)) varied in the following order: T-2 (4,067), T-1 (2,263) and T-3 (738). NO fluxes ( mu g m(-2) h(-1)) also followed the same descending order of T-2 (898) > T-1 (477) > T-3 (81). The possible effects of soil pH on NH3 fluxes were detected, as they concurrently exhibited a gradual and periodic change during the experimental period. Likewise, temperature was also found to have significant effect on NH3 and NO emission behavior. The results of the present work confirm that the application of fertilizer, when tested in the form of diverse treatment types, affected the emission of NH3 and NO in fertilized field soils at varying degrees.

AB Flux measurements of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were performed in a coniferous forest (Hoglwald) in southern Germany using a fully automated measuring system based on the dynamic chamber method. The forest soil was predominately a source of NO, but mean flux rates of NO ranged from -26.3 (deposition) to 55 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) (emission). NO2 was deposited on the forest soil with mean flux rates ranging from -4 to -72 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Removal of forest floor vegetation did not influence NO or NO2 fluxes. Apparently, forest floor vegetation was neither a source of NO nor a significant sink of NO2. When the organic layer of the forest soil was removed, net NO flux changed from emission to deposition. Thus NO emitted to the atmosphere was produced almost exclusively in the organic layer of the forest soil. Liming caused a significant decrease in the rate of NO emission by 43 to 100%, whereas irrigation with simulated acid rain increased the emission of NO by a factor of 3.1. Irrigation with simulated "normal" rain decreased the emission of NO by 35 to 100%. No such effects could be detected for the deposition of NO2.

AB Even though the fundamental role played by nitrogen oxides in several important atmospheric processes is generally acknowledged, the understanding and quantitative evaluation of some mechanisms involved in the biogenic emission of N gases is still incomplete. Because of the number and variety of chemical, biological and physical processes involved, their mutual interaction and the strong nonlinearities, the dynamics of biogenic nitrogen oxide emission are complex and difficult to study. In this context, this study is centred on the link between soil water content and gaseous emissions of N, and oxidized nitrogen gas, NO and N2O, from the ground. In particular, the study investigates how the probability distribution of soil moisture affects the distribution of the emission rate of nitrogen and nitrogen oxides when other limiting factors are absent. Some analytical tools are provided for the estimation of the steady-state probability density function of the emission rate. These toots are then used to investigate the influence of characteristics of rainfall regimes, plant transpiration, and soil texture on the emission process. It results that: (a) both frequency and depth of the storms strongly influence the shape and the moments of the probability density function of the emission rates; (b) higher values of plant transpiration favour nitric oxide emissions and give rise to higher variances in the emission rates; and (c) N2O emissions are greater in fine-textured soils than in coarser soils, while NO emissions are higher in coarser soils and can be very low in clayey soils where, instead, N-2 emissions become significant.

AB Nitrogen amendment followed by flooding irrigation is a general management practice fora wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain, which may favor nitrification and denitrification. Consequently, high emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are hypothesized to occur. To test this hypothesis, we performed year-round field measurements of N2O and NO fluxes from irrigated wheat-maize fields on a calcareous soil applied with all crop residues using a static, opaque chamber measuring system. To interpret the field data, laboratory experiments using intact soil cores with added carbon (glucose) and nitrogen (nitrate, ammonium) substrates were performed. Our field measurements showed that pulse emissions after fertilization and irrigation/rainfall contributed to 73% and 88% of the annual N2O and NO emissions, respectively. Soil moisture and mineral nitrogen contents significantly affected the emissions of both gases. Annual emissions from fields fertilized at the conventional rate (600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) totaled 4.0 +/- 0.2 and 3.0 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively, while those from unfertilized fields were much lower (0.5 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.4 +/- 0.05 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Direct emission factors (EF(d)s) of N2O and NO for the fertilizer nitrogen were estimated to be 0.59 +/- 0.04% and 0.44 +/- 0.04%, respectively. By summarizing the results of our study and others, we recommended specific EF(d)s (N2O: 0.54 +/- 0.09%; NO: 0.45 +/- 0.04%) for estimating emissions from irrigated croplands on calcareous soils with organic carbon ranging from 5 to 16 g kg(-1). Nitrification dominated the processes driving the emissions of both gases following fertilization. It was evident that insufficient available carbon limited microbial denitrification and thus N2O emission. This implicates that efforts to enhance carbon sink in calcareous soils likely increase their N2O emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) emissions from an agricultural field in the North China Plain were compared for three treatments during a whole maize growing period from 26 June to 11 October, 2012. Compared with the control treatment (without fertilization, designated as CK), remarkable pulse emissions of N2O, NO and NH3 were observed from the normal fertilization treatment (designated as NP) just after fertilization, whereas only N2O and NH3 pulse emissions were evident from the nitrification inhibitor treatment (designated as ND). The reduction proportions of N2O and NO emissions from the ND treatment compared to those from the NP treatment during the whole maize growing period were 31% and 100%, respectively. A measurable increase of NH3 emission from the ND treatment was found with a cumulative NH3 emission of 3.8 +/- 1.2 kg N/ha, which was 1.4 times greater than that from the NP treatment (2.7 +/- 0.7 kg N/ha).

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is an important component in nitrogen biogeochemical cycling produced through biological processes of nitrification and denitrification in soils, but the production and the consumption processes of NO in temperate mountain soil are less understood. Through laboratory experiments focusing on NO biogenic emissions from six kinds of mountain soils sampled from different vertical landscape zones, that is, coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest (CBE), fir forest (FF), spruce forest (SF), Erman's birch forest (EBF), alpine tundra (AT), and volcanic ash (VA), in the Changbai Mountains, northeastern China, we found that the optimum water-filled pore space (WFPS) for NO production varies between 22.5% and 35% for a range of mountain soils. The optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO emission for a certain soil type, however, was constant and independent of soil temperature. The NO emission potential for forest soils was about 7-50-fold higher than tundra soil and volcanic ash, indicating that it is strongly influenced by nutrient contents in soils. On the basis of laboratory results and field monitoring data, the average NO fluxes from these mountain soils were estimated to be 0.14-29.56 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for an entire plant growth period. NO emissions mainly occur in wet season for CBF and FF, but in dry season for other soil types.

DT Article
AB Measurements of biogenic soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) before and after a controlled burn conducted in a chaparral ecosystem on June 22, 1987, showed significantly enhanced emissions of both gases after the burn. Mean NO emissions from heavily burned and wetted (to simulate rainfall) sites exceeded 40 ng N m(-2) s(-1), an increase of 2 to 3 compared to preburn wetted site measurements. N2O emissions from burned and wetted sites ranged from 9 to 22 ng N m(-2) s(-1). Preburn N2O emissions from these wetted sites were all below the detection level of the instrumentation, indicating a flux below 2 ng N m(-2) s(-1). The flux of NO exceeded the N2O flux from burned wetted sites by factors ranging from 2.7 to 3.4. These measurements coupled with preburn and postburn measurements of ammonium and nitrate in the soil of this chaparral ecosystem and measurements of NO and N2O emissions obtained under controlled laboratory conditions suggest that the postfire enhancement of NO and N2O emissions is due to production of these gases by nitrifying bacteria.

AB In this paper we report on the first measurements of microbial soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the savannas in South Africa. In addition to natural, unperturbed emission measurements, we investigated the impact of natural rainfall, artificial irrigation, and fire on these emissions. Wetting and burning resulted in a significant enhancement in the emissions of NO. Mean background NO emissions from the dry sites ranged from 0.4 to 6.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and from the wetted sites ranged from 4.7 to 34.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1). After burning, the mean NO emissions from the dry sites increased and ranged from 13.3 to 15.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and from the wetted sites increased, exceeding 60 ng N m(-2) s(-1). Measurements of biogenic emissions of N2O were attempted, but emissions were not detected throughout the measurement period, indicating emissions below the minimum delectability of the instrumentation (2 ng N m(-2) s(-1)).

AB A survey of nitric oxide (NO) emission from Chihuahuan desert soils found mean NO fluxes < 0.1 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1) during the dry season. These fluxes were at the lower end of the range reported for temperate grassland and woodland ecosystems. NO fluxes from wet or watered soils were higher (0.1-35 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1)). Watering of black grama grassland soils produced an initial pulse of 12 ng cm(-2) h(-1) (12-h after 1-cm watering) with high fluxes sustained over 4 days with repeated watering. Initial pulses from shrubland soils were lower (maximum 5 ng cm(-2) h(-1)), and fluxes declined with repeated watering. Repeated watering of creosotebush soils depleted the soil NH4+ pool, and NO emissions were directly related to soil NH4+ concentrations at the end of the experiment. In watered and NH4+-fertilized creosotebush soils, NO fluxes were positively related to potential net nitrification rates. NH4+-fertilization boosted the initial NO pulse 15 times in the shrubland and 5 times in black grama grassland relative to watered controls. These experimental results point toward greater substrate limitation in shrublands. In this desert basin, NO emission averaged 0.12 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) in untreated soil and 0.76 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) in watered soil. We multiplied these averages by the distribution of grassland and shrubland vegetation within a 58,600-ha area of the Jornada del Muerto basin to estimate regional losses of 0.15-0.38 kg NO-N ha(-1) y(-1) for this area of the Chihuahuan desert.

AB Agricultural soil NO flux measurements (using a dynamic chamber technique) were made from 18 August to 1 September 1993 in the Upper Coastal Plain region of North Carolina in an effort to determine the role of natural emissions of NO on rural atmospheric photochemistry. Overall average NO flux rates increased proportionally to the level of applied fertilizer nitrogen in the agricultural soil. The soybean, cotton, and corn field measurements revealed an average NO flux of 1.79 (range - 1.0-6.9) ng N m(-2) s(-1); 3.77 (range - 0.1-38.0) ng N m(-2) s(-1); and 8.05 (range - 0.5-52.8) ng N m(-2) s(-1) respectively. There was a positive correlation between NO concentration near the soil surface (similar to 50 cm) and NO flux. A significant negative correlation between NO flux and ambient O-3 concentration, however, supports the hypothesis that soil emissions of NO contribute to local production of O-3 in rural areas.

AB Wildfires may increase soil emissions of trace nitrogen (N) gases like nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) by changing soil physicochemical conditions and altering microbial processes like nitrification and denitrification. When 34 studies were synthesized, we found a significant increase in both NO and N2O emissions up to 1 year post-fire across studies spanning ecosystems globally. However, when fluxes were separated by ecosystem type, we found that individual ecosystem types responded uniquely to fire. Forest soils tended to emit more N2O after fire, but there was no significant effect on NO. Shrubland soils showed significant increases in both NO and N2O emissions after fires; often with extremely large but short-lived NO pulses occurring immediately after fire. Grassland NO emissions increased after fire, but the size of this effect was small relative to shrublands. N2O emissions from burned grasslands were highly variable with no significant effect. To better understand the variation in responses to fire across global ecosystems, more consistent measurements of variables recognized as important controls on soil fluxes of NO and N2O (e.g., N cycling rates, soil water content, pH, and substrate availability) are needed across studies. We also suggest that fire-specific elements like burn severity, microbial community succession, and the presence of char be considered by future studies. Our synthesis suggests that fires can exacerbate ecosystem N loss long after they burn, increasing soil emissions of NO and N2O with implications for ecosystem N loss, climate, and regional air quality as wildfires increase globally.

AB Consumption of nitric oxide (NO) in a humisol was studied at 0.1-2 ppmv NO, a range representative of NO concentrations in ammonium-fertilized soil. Denitrification was not a major sink for NO. The principal NO-consuming reaction was a biological oxidation, leading ultimately to nitrate (NO2). Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrite (NO) may have been intermediates in this pathway. An abiological reaction accounted for about 25% of the NO-consuming activity in soil at 90% H2O (d.w.) and 25 degrees C, but contributed relatively more to total NO consumption at higher temperatures. Biological NO-consuming activity was highest at 25 degrees C, while the abiological activity increased exponentially with temperature. The product of the abiological reaction was neither NO3-, NO2-, nor nitrous oxide (N2O), and the reaction did not require O-2.

AB A national inventory of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions with county spatial resolution and monthly time resolution has been developed from empirical relationships that were derived from soil NO emissions data. The empirical relationships used to develop the inventory relate the emission of NO to soil temperature and a factor which is representative of an ecosystem or type of land use. Most of the ecosystem/land use factors were derived from analyses of NO emission data from seven different sites in the United States that are representative of three ecosystems and two agricultural land use types. Other agricultural (crop) land use factors were estimated from the two calculated factors based on differences in fertilization associated with the crops. This soil emission inventory exhibits three general features. First, croplands, especially where corn is grown, appear to be significant sources of NO. This has important implications because agricultural activities tend to be localized to certain regions in the United States (i.e., the Midwest) and are highest during the summer, when photochemistry is also most active. Second, undisturbed areas, such as grasslands, forests, and wetlands, do not appear to contribute substantially to atmospheric NO. Third, extensive areas in the western United States have not been included because soil NO emission data are lacking.

AB We analysed nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO) and carbon dioxide ( CO2) emissions from two beech forest soils close to Vienna, Austria, which were exposed to different nitrogen input from the atmosphere. The site Schottenwald (SW) received 20.2 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and Klausenleopoldsdorf ( KL) 12.6 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) through wet deposition. Nitric oxide emissions from soil were measured hourly with an automatic dynamic chamber system. Daily N2O measurements were carried out by an automatic gas sampling system. Measurements of nitrous oxide (N2O) and CO2 emissions were conducted over larger areas on a biweekly ( SW) or monthly (KL) basis by manually operated chambers. We used an autoregression procedure (time-series analysis) for establishing time-lagged relationships between N-oxides emissions and different climate, soil chemistry and N-deposition data. It was found that changes in soil moisture and soil temperature significantly effected CO2 and N-oxides emissions with a time lag of up to two weeks and could explain up to 95% of the temporal variations of gas emissions. Event emissions after rain or during freezing and thawing cycles contributed significantly (for NO 50%) to overall N-oxides emissions. In the two-year period of analysis the annual gaseous N2O emissions at SW ranged from 0.64 to 0.79 kg Nha(-1) y(-1) and NO emissions were 0.24 to 0.49 kg Nha(-1) per vegetation period. In KL significantly lower annual N2O emissions (0.52 to 0.65 kg N2O-N kg ha(-1) y(-1)) as well as considerably lower NO-emissions were observed. During a three-month measurement campaign NO emissions at KL were 0.02 kg N ha(-1)), whereas in the same time period significantly more NO was emitted in SW (0.32 kg NO-N ha(-1)). Higher N oxides emissions, especially NO emissions from the high N-input site (SW) may indicate that atmospheric deposition has an impact on emissions of gaseous N from our forest soils. At KL there was a strong correlation between N-deposition and N-emission over time, which shows that low N-input sites are especially responsive to increasing N-inputs.

AB Soil emissions have long been recognized as an important source of nitric oxide (NO), which regulates atmospheric oxidative capacity and the production of air pollutants. Recent research has also indicated that nitrous acid (HONO) can be emitted in significant quantities from soil microbial activities. However, only a few studies have quantified emissions of HONO along with NO from a wide range of soil types. In this study, we measured emissions of HONO and NO from soil samples collected from 48 sites across China and found much higher emissions of HONO than of NO, especially for samples from northern China. We performed a meta-analysis of 52 field studies in China, which revealed that long-term fertilization increased the abundance of nitrite-producing genes much more than the abundance of NO-producing genes. This promotion effect was greater in northern China than in southern China. In simulations using a chemistry transport model with laboratory-derived parametrization, we found that HONO emissions had a greater effect than NO emissions on air quality. Moreover, we determined that with projected continuous reductions in anthropogenic emissions, the contribution from soils to maximum 1 h concentrations of hydroxyl radicals and ozone and daily average concentrations of particulate nitrate in the Northeast Plain will increase to 17%, 4.6%, and 14%, respectively. Our findings highlight the need to consider HONO in the assessment of the loss of reactive oxidized nitrogen from soils to the atmosphere and its effect on air quality.

AB As natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems are major sources of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and of the atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO), predicting the source strengths of these ecosystems is central to understanding and sustainably managing the N-oxides fluxes. Here we reviewed 82 high temporal resolution datasets on N2O and 57 on NO fluxes collected from multi-site and multi-year field measurements, including grasslands, forests, and agricultural crops, to assess whether soil N intensity, that is, the time-weighted sum of soil NH4+ and/or NO3- concentrations, can be used to estimate annual N-oxides emissions. We show that soil N intensity alone can accurately predict annual N2O and NO emissions, and that the N2O emission strength is exponentially related to the soil inorganic N load. Thus, measuring soil inorganic N loads should improve current estimates of N-oxide emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, and open possibilities for monitoring N2O mitigation efforts.

AB Nitrous oxide is an important greenhouse gas and is a major ozonedepleting substance. To understand and quantify soil nitrous oxide emissions, we expanded the Community Land Model with coupled Carbon and Nitrogen cycles version 3.5 by inserting a module to estimate monthly varying nitrous oxide emissions between 1975 and 2008. We evaluate our soil N2O emission estimates against existing emissions inventories, other processbased model estimates, and observations from sites in the Amazon, North America, Central America, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and in Europe. The model reproduces precipitation, soil temperature, and observations of N2O emissions well at some but not at all sites and especially not during winter in the higher latitudes. Applying this model to estimate the past 24 years of global soil N2O emissions, we find that there is a significant decrease (increase) in soil N2O emissions associated with El Nino (La Nina) events.

AB Biochar amendment has been recommended as a potential strategy to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions for wheat production, but its mechanism and effective duration are not well understood. The 1-octyne and 2-pheny l-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) in combination with potassium chlorate were used to evaluate the relative contribution of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) to potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) and N2O and NO production as affected by biochar. Acidic and alkaline soils were collected during wheat-growing season, and four treatments were installed in each soil type: CK, urea alone; BE, biochar-enriched soil for 2-6 years; FB, fresh biochar added to CK; and AB, aged biochar added to CK. The results showed that octyne and PTIO efficiently assessed AOB and AOA activities in soil incubation. The AOB-driven PAO in acidic soil was largely enhanced by increased soil pH in BE and FB treatments, whereas AOA-driven PAO was not. And the contribution of AOB to PAO exceeded 80% in alkaline soil. The N2O and NO production were positively correlated with PAO in both soils. BE treatment decreased the direct N2O and NO production in alkaline soil, while both BE and FB treatments decreased the N2O and NO yields in acidic soil, indicating that biochar mitigated soil N2O and NO emissions for wheat production. The lack of differences between AB and CK treatments indicated that aged biochar lost its initial effects on PAO, while the biocharenriched soil amended with biochar years earlier still functioned similarly as fresh biochar.

AB Arable soils are a significant source of nitric oxide (NO), most of which is derived from nitrogen fertilizers. Accurate estimates of NO emissions from these soils are essential to devise strategies to mitigate the impact of agriculture on tropospheric ozone production and destruction. This paper presents the implementation of a soil NO emissions submodel within the environmentally-orientated soil-crop model, CERES-EGC. The submodel simulates NO production via the nitrification pathway, as modulated by soil environmental drivers. The resulting model was tested with data from 4 field experiments on wheat- and maize-cropped soils representative of two agricultural regions of France, over three years, and encompassing various climatic conditions. Overall, the model provided accurate predictions of NO emissions, but shortcomings arose from an inadequate vertical distribution of N fertilizer in the soil surface. Inclusion of a 2-cm thick topsoil layer in a 'micro-layer' version of CERES-EGC gave more realistic simulations of NO emissions and under-lying microbiological process. From a statistical point of view, both versions of the model achieved a similar fit to the experimental data, with respectively a MD and a RMSE ranging from 1.8 to 6.2 g N-NO ha(-1)d(-1), and from 22.8 to 25.2 g N-NO ha(-1)d(-1) across the 4 experiments. The cumulative NO losses represented 1-2% of NH4+ fertilizer applied in the case of maize crops, and about 1% in the case of wheat crops. The 'micro-layer' version may be used for spatialized inventories of NO emissions to improve air quality prediction.

AB In China, vegetable croplands are characterized by intensive fertilization and cultivation, which produce significant nitrogenous gases to the atmosphere. In this study, nitric oxides (NOX) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the croplands Cultivated with three typical vegetables had been measured in Yangtze River Delta of China from September 2 to December 16, 2006. The NO fluxes varied in the ranges of 1.6-182.4, 1.4-2901 and 0.5-487 ng Nm(-2) s(-1) with averages of 33.8 +/- 44.2, 360 +/- 590 and 76 +/- 112 (mean +/- SD) ngNm(-2) s(-1) for cabbage, garlic, and radish fields (n = 88), respectively. N2O fluxes from the three vegetable fields were found to occur in pulses and significantly promoted by tillage with average values of 5.8, 8.8, and 4.3 ng Nm(-2) h(-1) for cabbage, garlic, and radish crops, respectively. Influence of vegetables canopy on the NO emission was investigated and quantified. It was found that on cloudy days the canopy can only shield NO emission from croplands soil while on sunny days it cannot only prevent NO emission but also assimilate NO through the open leaves stomas. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that soil temperature was the most important factor in controlling NO emission, followed by fertilizer amount and gravimetric soil water content. About 1.2%, 11.56% and 2.56% of applied fertilizers N were emitted as NO-N and N2O-N from the cabbage, garlic and radish plots, respectively. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI EMISSIONS OF NITROGEN-OXIDES FROM EQUATORIAL RAIN-FOREST IN
   CENTRAL-AFRICA - ORIGIN AND REGULATION OF NO EMISSION FROM SOILS
SO TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Emissions of nitric oxide from soils of equatorial rain forest were measured in the Dimonika Natural Park (4-degrees30'S, 12-degrees30'E) in the Mayombe Forest in Congo.  Three research campaigns were carried out in June and July 1991 and in February 1992.  Fluxes were measured by dynamic chamber techniques using a chemiluminescence instrument Scintrex LMA3.  NO fluxes measured on natural soils are in between 5 and 17 x 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1; they are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in similar tropical forest media.  Soil treatment experiments show that the auto-decomposition of HNO2 in these acid soils (pH # 4) (chemodenitrification) is a potentially important cause of nitric oxide production in this type of ecosystem.  Nitrous acid comes from autotrophic nitrification all the year round, and also from biological denitrification, shown by N2O emissions, during the rainy season.  The regulation of NO release from soils is linked to ammonia production from litter mineralisation and to direct NH4 input by throughfall.

AB Nitrogen isotopic signatures are very useful for identifying sources of atmospheric NOx or NO3. Although soil is a major source of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), yet nitrogen isotopic composition of soil-released NO has not been directly measured. Since a large portion of soil NO emission is induced by fertilizer application in food production, in the present study we determined N isotopic signatures of NO from cropland soils fertilized with urea and ammonium bicarbonate (ABC). NO was oxidized to NO2 and then converted to nitrite for nitrogen isotope analysis; tests with NO standard gas revealed no significant nitrogen isotopic fractioning during the trapping and processing procedures. While the applied urea and ABC had delta N-15 values of + 1.3 parts per thousand and + 7.2 parts per thousand, respectively, soil-released NO had delta N-15 values increasing from -48.9 parts per thousand (day 2) to -28.0 parts per thousand (day 13) after urea fertilization and from -48.6 parts per thousand (day 2) to -19.9 parts per thousand (day 13) after ABC fertilization. This much N-15 depleted isotopic composition of soil-released NO makes it possible to distinguish soil emission from fuel combustion for the contribution of atmospheric NOx or NO3. Nitrogen isotopic compositions of soil substrate NH4+ and NO3- were also determined, and the instantaneous nitrogen isotopic enrichment factor of NO relative to those of substrate NH4+ and NO3- indicated both nitrification and denitrification occurred for NO production, although only NH4+-based fertilizers were applied.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) fluxes to the atmosphere were determined from different soil types in coniferous forest and deciduous forest in the Netherlands. Dynamic chambers were used to determine the emission every week throughout a year. Forest type and soil texture are important parameters leading to large differences in fluxes between sites. High fluxes of up to 178 ng m(-2)? s(-1) were observed in summer in a Douglas fir forest on a sandy soil. In a nearby beech forest, on the same soil, fluxes of up to 63 ng m(-2)? s(-1) were observed. Emissions from clayey soils in a beech forest were much lower, ranging from 0 to 14 ng m(-2) s(-1). Besides the important effect of the forest community type and the soil texture on the NO flux, a strong positive correlation with soil temperature was observed (accounting for up to 70% of the variance). Soil moisture could explain up to 60% of the variance of the NO flux. It seems that an optimum range of intermediate moisture content exists, ranging from 30 to 45% dry weight or from 55 to 85% water-filled pore space, approximately, where high temperatures lead to high emissions.

AB Nitric oxide fluxes from soils in the Trachypogon savanna of the Orinoco basin were deter mined during the dry season using the static chamber method. The emission from dry soils fluctuated from 0.4 to 3 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and increased up to 25 ng N m(-2) s(-1) after moderate watering or light rainfalls (1 to 5 mm). The mean emission values are up to 6 times lower than one observed earlier at the Chaguaramas site, but up to 10 times higher than one recorded at the Guri site, indicating an important spatial variability in NO fluxes of the Venezuelan savanna region. The changes observed after the addition of nitrogen to the soil, in the form of ammonium and/or nitrate, indicate a high denitrification potential in this acidic soil. Burning of the surface vegetation produced an increase by a factor of 10 in the emission rate of NO, but the effect was relatively short in time, about 5 days. It was estimated for the savanna region that burning increases the total NO soil emission during the dry season by 15% compared to the unburnt case. Soils with termite nests emit 10 times more NO than soil without nests, but the contribution from this source is less than 2% of the total savanna soil flux.

AB The purpose of this research is to consider a novel concept for measuring and monitoring (M&M) the presence and levels of contaminants in soil. Current M&M techniques include direct sensing for the target contaminant and the surrogate indicators of respired O-2 and CO2. The method suggested here is based on nitric oxide (NO). It is an alternative M&M method that could become quicker, easier, more reliable, and less expensive than the other M&M methods being used currently. NO emission from toluene contaminated soil and soil microbial activity were investigated to understand the NO-toluene-soil microbial relationships using fluorescent in situ hybridization molecular technique combined by enzymatic method. The relationships have been analyzed by the comparison of experimental measurements coming from analysis of variance statistical analysis, referring to toluene concentrations. Relationships between NO emissions and the microbial activity were significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with the level of toluene concentration and duration of toluene contamination. Thus, NO emissions are suggested as a useful indicator of microbial activity in toluene contaminated soils.

AB Cumulative nitrous oxide emissions measured in a field experiment (g N2O-N.ha(-1), 19 August 1999-9 March 2000) for residues incorporated in the autumn on a sandy loam soil were significantly different: no residue (180) < barley (310) < peas (405); and, rotovate (248) < plough (349). For no residue and sugarbeet treatments incorporated in October, cumulative emissions were 713 and 268 g N2O-N.ha(-1), respectively, compared to 218 and 234 g N2O-N.ha(-1) for incorporation in January. The same trends were observed in 1998- 9, although emissions were greater (up to 1.9 kg N2O-N.ha(-1)). Emission factors for all the crop residues investigated were lower than the IPCC default value (1.25%). Emissions of NO, measured in 1999 2000 during the period immediately following cultivation were greater in August (0.99-1.55 g NO-N.ha(-1).d(-1)) compared to October (0.09-0.58) and January (0.10-0.22). Consistently lower NO emissions were obtained from ploughed compared to rotovated treatments.

AB The application of organic and mineral fertilisers to soil can result in increased gaseous emissions to the atmosphere such as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. The aim of this study was to evaluate under laboratory conditions the effects on mineral N dynamics and NO and N2O emissions of application to soil of cattle slurry derived liquid fraction (LF) obtained by screw press and mineral fertiliser (MF), both treated with or without the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). An aerobic laboratory incubation was performed over 93 days with a Dystric Cambisol amended with mechanically separated LF or mineral fertiliser ammonium sulphate only or combined with DMPP. Two additional treatments were included: soil only and soil amended with DMPP. Nitrogen immobilisation was the dominant process with ME amendment, whereas N mineralisation has been observed with LF. The application of LF reduced significantly NO emissions by 80% relative to mineral but no differences were observed with N2O emissions. The addition of DMPP to MF induced a decrease of 18 and 29% in NO and N2O emissions whereas DMPP combined with LF reduced (numerically but not statistically) these emissions in 20 and 10%, respectively. Results obtained in our study suggest that N (NO + N2O) losses can be mitigated by adding DMPP to mineral fertilisers or replacing mineral fertiliser by LF.

AB The diurnal variation of nitric oxide (NO) emission fluxes from a Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina mangrove wetland were studied in the Zhangjiang River Estuary Mangrove National Nature Reserve using a dynamic chamber-based technique and a chemiluminescent analyzer. Results from field experiments show that NO emission from K. obovata and A. marina sampling sites reached maximal values of 1.07 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and 1.23 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively after the night tide. Meanwhile NO emission maintained at a steady lower level in daytime for both wetland sites. In laboratory experiments, NO emission from the mangrove wetland soil samples treated with simulated tides in the darkness exhibited higher values than those in the light, therefore it seems that tides and darkness could increase NO emission from mangrove wetlands, while intensive light, high temperature, and dryness in the daytime decreased NO emission. Compared with K. obovata soil samples, the diurnal average NO emission rate of the A. marina site was significantly higher, which was closely related to relatively higher diurnal average CO2 emission rate, soil available nitrogen content and soil net nitrification rate of the A. marina site. Moreover, soil samples of the A. marina site were more responsive to simulated tides and the addition of nitrogen than those of the K. obovata site. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soils are important sources of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO) in the atmosphere. These nitrogen (N)-containing gases play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry and climate at different scales because of reactions modulated by NO and hydroxyl radicals (OH), which are formed via HONO photolysis. Northern permafrost soils have so far remained unexplored for HONO and NO emissions despite their high N stocks, capacity to emit nitrous oxide (N2O), and enhancing mineral N turnover due to warming and permafrost thawing. Here, we report the first HONO and NO emissions from high-latitude soils based on measurements of permafrost-affected subarctic peatlands. We show large HONO (0.1-2.4 mu g N m(-2)h(-1)) and NO (0.4-59.3 mu g N m(-2)h(-1)) emissions from unvegetated peat surfaces, rich with mineral N, compared to low emissions (<= 0.2 mu g N m(-2)h(-1) for both gases) from adjacent vegetated surfaces (experiments with intact peat cores). We observed HONO production under highly variable soil moisture conditions from dry to wet. However, based on complementary slurry experiments, HONO production was strongly favored by high soil moisture and anoxic conditions. We suggest urgent examination of other Arctic landscapes for HONO and NO emissions to better constrain the role of these reactive N gases in Arctic atmospheric chemistry.

AB NO fluxes from soils are a significant source for tropospheric NOR, though global and regional estimates of the soil source strength are constrained by the paucity of measurements. In a continuous 18 month effort (2012-2014) soil NO fluxes from an intensively managed arable site in the black soil region of the Southern Ukraine (Odessa region) were measured using an automated dynamic chamber system. Measurements revealed three periods of peak NO emissions (fertigation, re-wetting of soils, and to a lower extend during winter), with a pulse emission peak during soil re-wetting in summer of 88.4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). The mean annual NO flux was 5.1 +/- 8.9 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) and total annual NO emissions were 0.44 +/- 0.78 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The fertilizer induced emission factor for NO was 0.63% under beetroot. The combined effect of soil temperature, soil moisture and soil DIN (NH4+ and NO3-) concentrations were identified as drivers of the temporal and spatial variability of soil NO fluxes. This work shows that long-term measurements are needed for estimating annual fluxes and the importance of soils as a source for tropospheric NOx as the contribution of different seasons and crop growing periods to the annual budget differed markedly.

AB Soils are among the major sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), which play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry. Here we systematically synthesized the modeling studies and field measurements and presented a novel soil NO emission inventory of terrestrial ecosystems in China. The previously modeled inventories ranged from 480 to 1375 and from 242.8 to 550 Gg N yr(-1) for all lands and croplands, respectively. Nevertheless, all the previous modeling studies were conducted based on very few measurements from China. According to the current synthesis of field measurements, most soil NO emission measurements were conducted at croplands, while the measurements were only conducted at two sites for forest and grassland. The median NO flux was 3.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1) with a fertilizer induced emission factor (FIE) of 0.04% for rice fields, and was 7.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1) with an FIE of 0.67% for uplands. A novel NO emission inventory of 1226.33 (ranging from 588.24 to 2132.05) Gg N yr(-1) was estimated for China's terrestrial ecosystems, which was about 18% of anthropogenic emissions. More field measurements should be conducted to cover more biomes and obtain more representative data in order to well constrain soil NO emission inventory of China.

AB The net nitric oxide (NO) flux from the soil of a tropical rain forest site in Reserva Biologica Jaru (Rondonia, Brazil) was continuously measured in May and during September-November 1999 using dynamic chambers. The median net NO flux was 4.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in May (1000 individual measurements) and 4.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in September-November (4200 individual measurements). The daily variation of the net NO flux was positively correlated to the daily variations of soil temperature. Minor rain events (<10 mm) had no significant influence on the 24-hour mean net NO flux. Following larger amounts of rain, a 40% reduction of the 24-hour mean net NO flux up to a 150% increase was observed. During the September-November experiment the soil NO concentration and the soil NO bulk diffusion coefficient were measured to calculate the net NO flux using an indirect method. The soil NO concentration was continuously measured at 0.03-m depth. It ranged from 20 to 460 ppb and was positively correlated with soil moisture and soil temperature. The soil bulk diffusion coefficient determined from Rn-222 flux and soil-air activity gradient measurements ranged from 2.7 x 10(-7) to 9.1 x 10(-7) m(-2) s(-1\) and was parameterized with soil air-filled pore space. The median net NO flux calculated by the indirect method was 3.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1) (1600 individual measurements).

AB Fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) Were measured during the summer of 1994 (12 July to 11 August) in the Upper Coastal Plain of North Carolina in a continuing effort to characterize NO emissions from intensively managed agricultural soils in the southeastern United States. Previous work during a similar time of year on the same soil type was characterized by severe moisture stress conditions. The summer of 1994 provided a more diverse weather pattern and as a result represented a set of measurements more typical of soil temperature and soil moisture relationships for the southeastern United States. In order to ascertain NO Aux response to fertilization and crop type, measurements were made on fields with three distinct fertilizer practices and crop types, namely corn, cotton, and soybean. Average NO fluxes were 21.9 +/- 18.6, 4.3 +/- 3.7, and 2.1 +/- 0.9 ng N m(-1)s(-1), respectively, for corn, cotton, and soybean. NO flux increased exponentially with soil temperature when soil water content was not limiting [> 30% Water Filled Pore Space (%WFPS)]. During conditions when soil water content was limiting, NO flux was inhibited and had no relationship with soil temperature. Above a value of 30% WFPS, increasing soil water content had no effect on NO emissions (the upper limit of %WFPS could not be estimated due to a lack of data in this regime). Below 30% WFPS, increasing soil moisture increased NO production and lower soil moistures led to decreased NO flux. Increased nitrogen fertilization rates led to higher NO fluxes. However, differences in physiological growth stages between crops confound extractable nitrogen values as decomposing root biomass in the mature corn crop added an undetermined amount of available nitrogen to the soil. Interactions between soil water content, fertilizer application, and soil temperature make it very difficult to predict day-to-day variations of NO Bur from our data. There appears to be no simple relation between NO flux and the environmental variables measured in Clayton, NC during the summer of 1994. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Agricultural soils are a major source of nitric- (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which are produced and consumed by biotic and abiotic soil processes. The dominant sources of NO and N2O are microbial nitrification and de nitrification, and emissions of NO and N2O generally increase after fertiliser application.
   The present study investigated the impact of N-source distribution on emissions of NO and N2O from soil and the significance of denitrification, rather than nitrification, as a source of NO emissions. To eliminate spatial variability and changing environmental factors which impact processes and results, the experiment was conducted under highly controlled conditions. A laboratory incubation system (DENIS) was used, allowing simultaneous measurement of three N-gases (NO, N2O, N-2) emitted from a repacked soil core, which was combined with N-15-enrichment isotopic techniques to determine the source of N emissions.
   It was found that the areal distribution of N and C significantly affected the quantity and timing of gaseous emissions and N-15-analysis showed that N2O emissions resulted almost exclusively from the added amendments. Localised higher concentrations, so-called hot spots, resulted in a delay in N2O and N-2 emissions causing a longer residence time of the applied N-source in the soil, therefore minimising NO emissions while at the same time being potentially advantageous for plant-uptake of nutrients. If such effects are also observed for a wider range of soils and conditions, then this will have major implications for fertiliser application protocols to minimise gaseous N emissions while maintaining fertilisation efficiency.

AB Straw return in combination with synthetic N fertilizer is considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield. Such practice, however, can considerably modify soil microbial activity and relative C and N availability, both of which are known to regulate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Minimizing these emissions per unit of crop yield is a prerequisite to minimize the environmental footprint of agricultural production and thus, a policy objective. In our study, we quantified N2O and NO emissions and determined fertilizer-N use efficiencies (NUE) and crop yields of two double-cropping (summer maize/Welsh onion-winter wheat) systems with and without straw incorporation in the North China Plain. Relative to the fertilized treatment without straw amendments, straw incorporation showed a significant inhibitory effect on annual N2O emissions from the maize-wheat system (-31%), but no significant effect was observed for the Welsh onion-wheat system. However, straw return significantly reduced annual NO emissions by >30% for both systems. Meanwhile, straw return in both systems significantly increased the NUE and crop yields by 34-47% and 7-16%, respectively, as compared to the treatment without straw additions. Across the double-cropping systems, annual direct emission factors of N2O, NO and N2O + NO were 0.37-0.57%, 0.08-0.78% and 0.57-1.36%, respectively. Furthermore, a negative relationship between direct emission factors of N2O + NO and crop NUE was observed, highlighting the importance of optimizing NUE for reducing environmental risks of a cropping system. When expressing emissions on a yield basis, straw return significantly reduced annual yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions by 15-42% for both systems. Overall, our results show that the combined application of crop straw and synthetic N fertilizer is a promising N management strategy for maximizing crop yields while mitigating N-trace gas emissions.

AB Tropical nitrogen (N) deposition is projected to increase substantially within the coming decades. Increases in soil emissions of the climate-relevant trace gases NO and N2O are expected, but few studies address this possibility. We used N addition experiments to achieve N-enriched conditions in contrasting montane and lowland forests and assessed changes in the timing and magnitude of soil N-oxide emissions. We evaluated transitory effects, which occurred immediately after N addition, and long-term effects measured at least 6 weeks after N addition. In the montane forest where stem growth was N limited, the first-time N additions caused rapid increases in soil N-oxide emissions. During the first 2 years of N addition, annual N-oxide emissions were five times (transitory effect) and two times (long-term effect) larger than controls. This contradicts the current assumption that N-limited tropical montane forests will respond to N additions with only small and delayed increases in soil N-oxide emissions. We attribute this fast and large response of soil N-oxide emissions to the presence of an organic layer (a characteristic feature of this forest type) in which nitrification increased substantially following N addition. In the lowland forest where stem growth was neither N nor phosphorus (P) limited, the first-time N additions caused only gradual and minimal increases in soil N-oxide emissions. These first N additions were completed at the beginning of the wet season, and low soil water content may have limited nitrification. In contrast, the 9- and 10-year N-addition plots displayed instantaneous and large soil N-oxide emissions. Annual N-oxide emissions under chronic N addition were seven times (transitory effect) and four times (long-term effect) larger than controls. Seasonal changes in soil water content also caused seasonal changes in soil N-oxide emissions from the 9- and 10-year N-addition plots. This suggests that climate change scenarios, where rainfall quantity and seasonality change, will alter the relative importance of soil NO and N2O emissions from tropical forests exposed to elevated N deposition.

AB Land spreading nitrogen-rich municipal waste biosolids (NO ((3)) over bar -N<256mg N kg(-1) dry weight, NH3-N similar to 23,080mg N kg(-1) dry weight, Total Kjeldahl N similar to 41,700 mg N kg(-1) dry weight) to human food and non-food chain land is a practice followed throughout the US. This practice may lead to the recovery and utilization of the nitrogen by vegetation, but it may also lead to emissions of biogenic nitric oxide (NO), which may enhance ozone pollution in the lower levels of the troposphere. Recent global estimates of biogenic NO emissions from soils are cited in the literature, which are based on held measurements of NO emissions from various agricultural and non-agricultural fields. However, biogenic emissions of NO from soils amended with biosolids are lacking. Utilizing a state-of-the-art mobile laboratory and a dynamic flow-through chamber system, in-situ concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) were measured during the spring/summer of 1999 and winter/spring of 2000 from an agricultural soil which is routinely amended with municipal waste biosolids, The average NO flux for the late spring/summer time period (10 June 1999-5 August 1999) was 69.4 +/- 34.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1). Biosolids were applied during September 1999 and the field site was sampled again during winter/spring 2000 (28 February 2000-9 March 2000), during which the average flux was 3.6 +/- 1.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1). The same field site was sampled again in late spring (2-9 June 2000) and the average flux was 64.8 +/- 41.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1). An observationally based model, developed as part of this study, found that summer accounted for 60% of the yearly emission while fall, winter and spring accounted for 20%, 4% and 16% respectively. Field experiments were conducted which indicated that the application of biosolids increases the emissions of NO and that techniques to estimate biogenic NO emissions would, on a yearly average, underestimate the NO flux from this field by a factor of 26. Soil temperature and % water filled pore space (%WFPS) were observed to be significant variables for predicting NO emissions, however %WFPS was found to be most significant during high soil temperature conditions. In the range of pH values found at this site (5.8 +/- 0.3), pH was not observed to be a significant parameter in predicting NO emissions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB [1] We conducted an experiment on sand and clay tropical forest soils to test the short-term effect of root mortality on the soil-atmosphere flux of nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide. We induced root mortality by isolating blocks of land to 1 m using trenching and root exclusion screening. Gas fluxes were measured weekly for ten weeks following the trenching treatment. For nitrous oxide there was a highly significant increase in soil-atmosphere flux over the ten weeks following treatment for trenched plots compared to control plots. N2O flux averaged 37.5 and 18.5 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) from clay trenched and control plots and 4.7 and 1.5 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) from sand trenched and control plots. In contrast, there was no effect for soil-atmosphere flux of nitric oxide, carbon dioxide, or methane.

In a 'pristine' soil, not previously exposed to high N deposition rates, an initial threshold of 40 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) was required to increase N2O emissions.

For soils exposed to long-term and large N deposition rates N2O losses >3% of the N deposition rate were calculated. This suggests that N2O losses of more than 3% of the N input can be indicative of soil ecosystems where the N input exceeds its demand. For NO a more limited data set showed losses ranging from 1.3 to 20% of the elevated N input. It was calculated that NH, emissions from all intensive pig and poultry farms in Great Britain accounted for 18 t N2O-N year(-1) and that poultry farms accounted for less than 3 t NO-N year(-1).

AB Balancing food security with fertilizer-driven climate impacts remains critical in intensive agriculture. While organic-inorganic substitution enhances soil fertility, its effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions remain uncertain. This study evaluated N2O/NO emissions, crop yields, and agronomic parameters in a subtropical wheat-maize rotation under four fertilization regimes: inorganic-only (NPK), manure-only (OM), and partial substitution with crop residues (CRNPK, 15%) or manure (OMNPK, 30%), all applied at 280 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Emissions aligned with the dual Arrhenius-Michaelis-Menten kinetics and revised "hole-in-the-pipe" model. Annual direct emission factors (EFd) for N2O and NO were 1.01% and 0.11%, respectively, with combined emissions (1.12%) exponentially correlated to soil nitrogen surplus (p < 0.01). CRNPK and OMNPK reduced annual N2O+NO emissions by 15-154% and enhanced NUE by 10-45% compared with OM, though OMNPK emitted 1.7-2.0 times more N2O/NO than CRNPK. Sole OM underperformed in yield, while partial substitution-particularly with crop residues-optimized productivity while minimizing environmental risks. By integrating emission modeling and agronomic performance, this study establishes CRNPK as a novel strategy for subtropical cereal systems, reconciling high yields with low greenhouse gas emissions.

AB In China, most farmers intensively producing vegetables in greenhouses use frequent flooding irrigation and apply excessive amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. This results in low resource use efficiency and high environmental N losses, partly in the form of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) or of the atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO). For ensuring high vegetable productivity at lower environmental costs, it is crucial to develop efficient irrigation and fertilization strategies. Here we report on year-round measurements of N2O and NO fluxes as well as crop yields for a greenhouse cucumber cultivation, comparing common farmers' practice with two alternative managements, i.e., drip fertigation (which reduced irrigation water amount to half of that used for flood irrigation) and reduction of chemical N application by 1/3. Soils managed by farmers' practice were an important source of atmospheric N-oxides, specifically with regard to N2O. Annual emissions were 60.5 and 1.39 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, for N2O and NO, which were 2.40% and 0.05% of the applied N, respectively. Compared to the farmers' practice, N2O emission factors under drip fertigation were decreased by 41%, while NO emission factors nearly doubled. Applying lower rates of N application reduced N2O and NO emission factors by 43% and 40%, respectively. Differences in the N-oxides emission strength were primarily ascribed to changes in soil microbial N turnover processes, i.e., higher moisture conditions in soils managed by farmers' practice favored denitrification in a greater extent compared with soils fertilized by drip fertigation. We also showed that drip fertigation and reducing fertilization rates by 1/3 did not compromise vegetable yields, so that lower yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions were calculated. Therefore, the replacement of farmers' practice by drip fertigation or by reducing the amount of N applied would help to secure productivity, while reducing the climate and air quality footprint of greenhouse vegetable production.

AB Soils have been widely acknowledged as important natural sources of nitric oxide (NO) and meanwhile sinks of nitric dioxide (NO2). High nitrogen deposition across South China could potentially result in large NO emissions from subtropical forests soils there. In this study, the dynamic chamber method was applied to monitor NO and NO2 fluxes at two subtropical forest sites in South China, namely "Qianyanzhou" (QYZ) and "Tieshanping" (TSP). Chronically higher N deposition occurred at TSP than that at QYZ. Besides soil water filled pore spaces (WFPS) and temperature, ambient NO concentration could also possibly be important in regulating temporal NO emissions, especially in the winter. For both sites, the optimum soil temperature was above 25 degrees C, while the optimum WFPS for NO release at QYZ was higher (65-70%) than that at TSP (<23%). Moreover, heavy rainfall could trigger NO emission pulses from moist soils at QYZ, while rainfall-induced NO pulses were only observed after a long drying period at TSP. Distinctly different contents of mineral nitrogen and soil moisture conditions between the two sites might induce the divergent preference of WFPS and responses to rainfall. The cumulative soil emission of NO reached 0.41 +/- 0.01 and 0.76 +/- 0.01 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at QYZ and TSP, contributing to 2.5% and 1.4% of the annual throughfall N input, respectively. At both sites, NO2 were mainly deposited to soils, accounting for 2% and 21% of soil-emitted NO at QYZ and TSP, respectively. The observed annual NO emissions at these two sites were larger than the median values observed for tropical and temperate forests and unfertilized croplands. Higher N deposition could induce larger NO emission potential, while soil temperature and pH might also be important in regulating regional soil NO emissions as N-loss from subtropical forests.

AB Pulse emissions of soil trace gases (carbon dioxide: CO2, nitrous oxide: N2O, and nitric oxide: NO) following the wetting of dry soils may contribute disproportionately to total annual trace gas emissions in drylands. These pulses are driven by coupled biotic-abiotic processes that are challenging to partition. Here we measured soil trace gases emissions after the wetting of gamma-irradiated and live intact cores of soils with different soil C and N pools, exchangeable cations, and microbial activity. For all soils, the emissions pulse of CO2 and N-oxides was measured within 5 min of wetting. Post-wetting CO2 emission pulses from the live soils were approximately twice as large as those from the gamma-irradiated soils and were correlated with soil C content. However, the gamma-irradiated soil emitted up to 5 times more N2O and up to 13 times more NO compared with the live soil and emissions were correlated with soil N content. After normalization against the soil inorganic N content, the immediate post-wetting N2O and NO emissions were the same from the live and gamma-irradiated soils. The dependence of the post-wetting N2O and NO burst on substrate pools, regardless of the presence of live microbes, suggests an abiotic origin of immediate post-wetting fluxes.

AB A mechanistic upscaling scheme was developed to estimate temporal nitric oxide [NO] emissions from soils for three distinct land use classes by spatial extrapolation of laboratory measurements for Zimbabwe (383,667 km(2)). Laboratory measurements on miombo woodland, grassland, and agricultural Zimbabwean soils were used to derive moisture- and temperature-dependent NO emission algorithms. By combining monthly fields of modeled soil moisture and temperature (based on climate means, vegetation indices, soil, and terrain elevation data) a mean monthly soil NO flux, including rainfall-induced elevated flux events (pulsing), was obtained. Countrywide emission rates ranged from 0.1-0.4 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for the dry season to wet season mean fluxes of 3.7-9.4 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for miombo, 4.4-7.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for grassland, and 4.6-10.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for agriculture. Annual net soil NO emissions (less canopy reduction) for Zimbabwe were 32.9 Gg N yr(-1), with miombo woodlands (66% of Zimbabwe) contributing 63% to the regional NO budget. Rainfall-induced NO pulsing contributed an additional 14% to countrywide annual bulk NO emissions. The majority of these pulses occurred during the first half of the rainy season (November-December), with agricultural soils contributing the most and grassland soils contributing the least to pulsing. The upscaling approach provided a first countrywide estimate of spatiotemporal soil NO emissions for a hitherto largely unresolved source: the soil-moisture-limited African subtropical savannas.

AB N2O and NO production were studied on five agricultural soils with low hydraulic potentials. All experiments were performed in a laboratory under standard incubation conditions to limit any intrinsic soil heterogeneity. The mechanisms involved in NO and N2O production was investigated using the inhibitory properties of acetylene on nitrification and N2O reduction. This work confirmed that N2O and NO could be produced by soils under aerobic conditions. Nitrification seemed to be the only process involved in NO production and the main process involved in N2O production by the five studied soils when the water content was low. Nevertheless, aerobic denitrification with N2O release was observed in one soil. The proportion of N emitted as NO and N2O through nitrification varied considerably from soil to soil and, in some soils, also varied with soil hydraulic potential, ranging from 0 to 2.5%, and from 0.03 to 1%, respectively. This study clearly shows that both NO emission and the gaseous N emitted in aerated conditions should be taken into account in determining the N-budget on cultivated soils.

AB The recently launched EU project NOFRETETE (Nitrogen Oxides Emissions from European Forest Ecosystems), which brings together nine European research groups, aims at improving the highly uncertain information about nitrogen oxides (NO and N2O) emissions from forest soils, with special respect to the impact of anthropogenic influences, like e.g. atmospheric N-deposition. It will consist of (i) a combination of field and laboratory experiments, (ii) further development and application of an existing biogeochemical process-oriented model for the prediction of N-trace gas emissions from forest soils (PnET-N-DNDC), (iii) coupling of the biogeochemical process model to a multi-layer canopy model to get reliable estimates of the N-trace gas exchange at the ecosystem level, (iv) linkage of the combined models to a GIS database, containing information about land-use, climate, soil properties and atmospheric N-deposition for the calculation of N-oxide emission inventories and scenarios for European forests.

ID NOX EMISSIONS; NITROGEN
AB Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in tropospheric photochemistry. Biogenic soil emissions of Nitric Oxide were measured from an intensively managed agricultural row crop (corn, Zea mays) during a four-week period (May 15 through June 9, 1995). The site was located in Washington County, near the town of Plymouth, which is in the Lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina, U.S.A. Soil NO flux was determined using a dynamic flow-through chamber technique. The measurement period was characterized by two distinguishing features: an application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer at the midpoint of the experiment and a non-typical rainfall pattern. Average NO flux prior to the application of N fertilizer was 31.5 +/- 10.1 ng N m(-2)s(-1), and more than doubled (77.7 +/- 63.7 ng N m(-2)s(-1)) after the application of a side dressing of N fertilizer. Average soil extractable nitrogen values did not change significantly following application of the side dressing of N fertilizer. We attribute this failure to detect a significant difference in soil extractable nitrogen following N fertilization to the method in which the fertilizer was applied, the subsequent rainfall pattern, and the mechanics of our sample system. NO flux followed the same diurnal trend as soil temperature, with maximum NO emissions coinciding with minimum soil temperature. NO flux was found to increase exponentially with soil temperature, but only after fertilization. Due to sub-surface irrigation practices employed by the farmer, changes in soil water content were minimal and no relation could be drawn between soil water content and NO flux.

AB It is well-known that nitric oxide ( NO) is an important component in nitrogen biogeochemical cycling produced through biological process of nitrification and denitrification in soils, but the production and the consumption processes of NO in sodic saline soil are less understood. Through a series of laboratory experiments focusing on NO biogenic emissions from four kinds of saline sodic soils of different land use in western Songnen Plain northestern China, we found that the optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO production and emission were 14.0%, 9.0%, 9.5%, and 18% water-filled pore space (WFPS) for soil samples from natural pasture, man-made pasture, paddy field of saline sodic soil mixed sandy soil, and paddy field of pure saline sodic soil, respectively. For a given moisture, NO fluxes increased exponentially with soil temperature at any given soil moisture. The optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO emission for a certain soil type, however, was constant and independent of soil temperature. The NO consumption processes for different land uses were similar in all studied saline sodic soils since the difference of NO consumption rate constant in these soils was small ( ranged from 1.07 x 10(-6) to 7.45 x 10(-6) m 3 kg(-1) s(-1)). The NO emission potential for paddy field soils was about 1.2-2-fold higher than pasture soils. On the basis of laboratory results and field monitoring data of soil water content and soil temperature, the average NO fluxes from these saline sodic soils in the region were estimated to be 1.3-4.9 ng m(-2) s(-1) for an entire plant growth period. NO fluxes for pastures mainly occurred in the dry season and were about threefold higher than that for paddy fields, which was strongly influenced by field management.

AB Abiotic release of nitrous acid (HONO) in equilibrium with soil nitrite (NO2-) was suggested as an important contributor to the missing source of atmospheric HONO and hydroxyl radicals (OH). The role of total soil-derived HONO in the biogeochemical and atmospheric nitrogen cycles, however, has remained unknown. In laboratory experiments, we found that for nonacidic soils from arid and arable areas, reactive nitrogen emitted as HONO is comparable with emissions of nitric oxide (NO). We show that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria can directly release HONO in quantities larger than expected from the acid-base and Henry's law equilibria of the aqueous phase in soil. This component of the nitrogen cycle constitutes an additional loss term for fixed nitrogen in soils and a source for reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere.

AB The biotic release of nitric oxide (NO), a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere contributes to climate change. In plants, NO plays a significant role in metabolic and signaling processes. However, little attention has been paid to the plant-borne portion of global NO emissions. Owing to the growing significance of global flooding events caused by climate change, the extent of plant NO emissions has been assessed under low-oxygen conditions for the roots of intact plants. Each examined plant species (tomato, tobacco, and barley) exhibited NO emissions in a highly oxygen-dependent manner. The transfer of data obtained under laboratory conditions to the global area of farmland was used to estimate possible plant NO contribution to greenhouse gas budgets. Plant-derived and stress-induced NO emissions were estimated to account for the equivalent of 1 to 9% of global annual NO emissions from agricultural land. Because several stressors induce NO formation in plants, the actual impact may be even higher.

TI Acidification and nitrification inhibition of manure alters greenhouse

AB Manure amendments are widely used in agriculture to enhance crop productivity and maintain soil organic matter, but they also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and reactive nitrogen (N) losses. Manure acidification and nitrification inhibitors (NIs) have been proposed as mitigation strategies, but their effectiveness likely varies with soil characteristics. To evaluate the influence of acidified and NI-treated manure on N cycling across different soil types, we conducted a 28-day laboratory incubation using soils collected from major agricultural regions in Wisconsin. We measured emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O ), nitric oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4), along with soil ammonium (NH4 +) and nitrate (NO3 (-)) dynamics. Acidified manure enhanced short-term NH4 + retention in all soils but increased cumulative N2O emissions in the sandy soil compared to untreated manure, likely due to pH-driven disruption of nitrification and incomplete denitrification. In contrast, the NI dicyandiamide (DCD) consistently suppressed nitrification early in the incubation, resulting in significantly lower N2O and NO emissions, often approaching levels observed in the no-manure controls, particularly in the sandy soil. Manure amendments increased CO(2)fluxes relative to the no-manure controls, but acidified manure emitted less CO(2)than DCD-treated manure, likely due to temporary suppression of microbial respiration. CH4 emissions were minimal and largely unaffected by treatments. NIs offer consistent benefits in reducing N2O and NO losses, while acidification can increase these emissions in certain soil conditions, highlighting the importance of tailoring management practices to specific soil characteristics. Plain Language Summary Farmers use manure to improve soil health and crop growth, but it can also releasegreenhouse gases and nitrogen into the environment. Two strategies have been proposed to limit these losses: acidifying manure and adding nitrification inhibitors(NIs). In a 28-day lab study using soils from across Wisconsin, we tested how thesetreatments affected greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen cycling. Acidified manurehelped soils hold more ammonium but increased nitrous oxide emissions in sandysoils, while the NI treatment (dicyandiamide) consistently reduced nitrous oxide andnitric oxide emissions, often to levels close to soils without manure. Manure addi-tions increased carbon dioxide release, although acidified manure gave off less thanNI-treated manure, and methane emissions were very low across all treatments. Over-all, NIs were effective in cutting nitrogen gas losses, while acidification sometimesincreased emissions depending on soil type, showing that manure management needsto be tailored to specific soil types.

AB Vegetable soils with high nitrogen input are hotspots of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), and biochar amended to soil has been documented to effectively decrease N2O and NO emissions. However, the aging effects of biochar on soil N2O and NO production and the relevant mechanisms are not thoroughly understood. A(15)N tracing microcosm study was conducted to clarify the responses of N2O and NO production pathways to the biochar aging process in vegetable soil. The results showed that autotrophic nitrification was the predominant source of N2O production. Biochar aging increased the O-containing functional groups while lowering the aromaticity and pore size. Fresh biochar enhanced the AOB-amoA gene abundance and obviously stimulated N2O production by 15.5% via autotrophic nitrification and denitrification. In contrast, field-aged biochar markedly weakened autotrophic nitrification and denitrification and thus decreased N2O production by 17.0%, as evidenced by the change in AOB-amoA and nosZI gene abundances. However, the amendment with artificially labaged biochar had no effect on N2O production. With the extension of aging time, biochar application reduced the soil NO production dominated by nitrification. Changes in the N2O and NO fluxes were closely associated with soil NH4+-N and NO2--N contents, indicating that autotrophic nitrification played a critical role in NO production. Overall, our study demonstrated that field-aged biochar suppressed N2O production via autotrophic nitrification and denitrification by regulating associated functional genes, but not for lab-aged biochar or fresh biochar. These findings improved our insights regarding the implications of biochar aging on N2O and NO mitigation in vegetable soils.

AB The signaling compound nitric oxide (NO) might play an important, yet unquantified role in mediating soil biogeochemical Carbon and Nitrogen cycles. This study quantified the effects of different soil-typical exogenous NO concentrations on the microbial community, on fertilizer N turnover, and on C and N trace gas fluxes of agricultural soil. For this, we repeatedly established soil NO concentrations of either 0, 200, 400, and ppbv-NO in soil mesocosms for in total of 12 days, followed by high-resolution automated measurements of CO2, NO, CH4, and N2O fluxes, molecular analysis of microbial community composition and 15N-isotope-tracing based assessment of fertilizer N turnover. We found no effects of different NO levels on microbial communities and CO2, CH4, and NO fluxes. However, at 200 ppbv concentration, exogenous NO promoted microbial assimilation of fertilizer N. In contrast, at 400 ppbv-NO concentration, microbial biomass N was reduced, and microbial uptake of fertilizer N was inhibited, accompanied by a 33% reduction of N2O emissions. This suggested a promoting effect of 200 ppbv-NO on the physiology of cells involved in heterotrophic microbial N turnover, probably reinforcing the role of cell-endogenous NO. In contrast, the higher exogenous NO concentrations of 400 ppbv seemed to inhibit heterotrophic microbial inorganic N assimilation, with however no increase in N2O emissions due to detoxification mechanisms. In conclusion, our pioneering study provides first insights into impacts of exogenous NO on soil C and N biogeochemistry in natural soil systems and reveals a NO concentration-dependent regulation of microbial N retention.

DT Article
ID IMPACTS; NO; QUALITY; LAGOON
AB The nitric oxide (NO) flux from eastern North Carolina soils subjected to flooding from hurricanes were studied in laboratory experiments. Three sites along the Neuse River basin in eastern North Carolina that sustained different intensities of flooding in September 1999 from Hurricane Floyd were examined. Hurricane Floyd impacted the Neuse River basin by inducing flooding that damaged and disabled hog (Sus scrofa) lagoons and municipal wastewater treatment plants. Between approximately 53 and 325 million liters (14 and 86 million gallons) of untreated hog waste and between approximately 5.7 and 34.4 billion liters (1.5 and 9.1 billion gallons) of untreated municipal wastewater are projected to have entered the Neuse River basin, increasing the concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and total solids. Phosphorus and total solids are projected to have increased 3.2 and 199.2 mg/L, respectively. Total N was projected to have increased by 9.8 mg/L, which is posited to have increased the NO flux from flooded soils for months after the hurricane. Nitric oxide emissions from soil can adversely affect ozone levels in the lower troposphere. Minimization of NO flux from soil is advantageous, protecting air quality as well as conserving valued nitrogen fertilizers. Hurricane-loaded soils were found to produce more than 30 times greater NO emissions than nonflooded soils with NO fluxes ranging from 0.1 to 102.5 ng N/(m(2) s).

AB Results from measurements of emission of nitrogen oxides from soils at three North American ecosystems are presented. These measurements were conducted during the summer and fall of 1988 at (1) a grassland site near Nunn, Colorado, (2) a coastal marine environment at North Inlet, South Carolina and (3) a deciduous forest near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Emission of NO was highest from the grassland soil (mean: 10.0 ng N m-2s-1), intermediate at the forest area (mean: 0.28 ng N m-2s-1) and lowest at the coastal site (mean: 0.034 ng N m-2s-1). A comparison of the results from the present study with previous measurements indicates that NO(x) (NO + NO2) emission from grasslands and temperate forests are similar within each ecosystem independent of location. This suggests that simple approaches may be used to estimate soil emissions over wide areas.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) plays a critical role in atmospheric chemistry and also is a precursor of nitrate, which affects particle matter formation and nitrogen deposition. Agricultural soil has been recognized as a main source of atmospheric NO. However, quantifying the NO fluxes emitted from croplands remains a challenge and in situ long-term measurements of NO are still limited. In this study, we used an automated sampling system to measure NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over two years (April 2017 to March 2019) from a rainfed maize field in the Northeast China. The cumulative annual NO emissions were 8.9 and 2.3 kg N ha-1 in year 1 (April 2017 to March 2018) and year 2 (April 2018 to March 2019), respectively. These interannual differences were largely related to different weather conditions encountered. In year 1, a month-long drought before and after the seeding and fertilizing reduced plant N uptake and dramatically increased soil N concentration. The following moderate rainfalls promoted large amount of NO emissions, which remained high until late September. The NO fluxes in both years showed clearer seasonal patterns, being highest after fertilizer application in summer, and lowest in winter. The seasonal patterns of NO fluxes were mainly controlled by soil available N concentrations and soil temperatures. The contribution of NO fluxes during the spring freeze-thaw in both years was no more than 0.2% of the annual NO budget, indicating that the freeze-thaw effect on agricultural NO emissions was minimal. In addition, with high-resolution monitoring, we found that soil not only act as a NO source but also a sink. Longterm and high-resolution measurements help us better understand the diurnal, seasonal, and annual dynamics of NO emissions, build more accurate models and better estimate global NO budget and develop more effective policy responses to global climate change.

AB Nutrient amendments and inhibition experiments were used to evaluate factors controlling the production of N trace gases in soils. Sampling was conducted at five sites which form a 200-4.5 x 10(6) y chronosequence in Hawaiian montane rainforest. The pattern of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux from soils in the laboratory was similar to that observed in the field, with emissions of NO + N2O increasing with soil age. Autoclaving of soils indicated that there was little or no abiological production of N2O. The response of N2O and NO flux to sieving and acetylene addition is consistent with N trace gas production being primarily denitrification-based in all but the oldest site, where nitrification-based production is significant. All the soils had increased emissions of N2O in response to additions of N. Soils from the 185,000-y-old Kohala site, however, had the lowest proportional N2O response, did not have elevated NO emissions in response to addition of N, and had a small, but significant NO response to addition of carbon. This intermediate-age site represents a transition stage in soil development in which N trace gas production is the least limited by N-availability. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB About 40% of the agricultural land in the European Union (EU) is grassland used for animal production. When grassland is tilled, organically bound carbon and nitrogen are released, providing substrates for nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms. The aim of this study was to examine the immediate effects of tillage of a perennial grassland carried out on different dates, on the emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), monitored intensively over a 5-day period, in a humid, dairy farming area of northern Spain. Soil was tilled 12 days and 2 days prior to fertiliser application. Tillage, time of tillage, and N fertiliser application affected NO and N2O emissions. Tillage 12 days before the start of the flux measurements resulted in higher emissions than tillage one day before, the difference being related to differences in soil mineral N and water-filled pore space (WFPS). Emissions of NO peaked at a WFPS of 50-60%, while N2O fluxes peaked at 70-90% WFPS. Loss of N was greater as N2O than as NO. The total loss of N as N2O plus NO ranged from 0.027 kg N ha(-1) in unfertilised plots to 0.56 kg N ha(-1) in the tilled and N fertilised plot. Thereafter emissions decreased rapidly to low values. The results of this study indicate that tillage of perennial grassland may release large amounts of NO and N2O, the amounts also depending on moisture conditions and addition of N fertiliser. We suggest that in order to reduce such emissions, application of N fertiliser should not immediately follow tillage of perennial grassland, as there is an extra supply of N from mineralisation of organic matter at this time.

AB Nitric oxide (NO), as a short-lived climate forcer, has direct and indirect detrimental impacts on environmental quality and human health. The amount of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application to agricultural soils is considered a robust predictor of total NO emissions, but the estimates of cropland NO emissions have large uncertainties due to the widely used constant emission factors (EF) as e.g., default values recommended by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodologies. By compiling 223 field experiments with at least three N-input levels across various croplands, we performed a meta-analysis to determine how soil NO emissions respond to N inputs. Our results showed for the first time that the mean change in EF per unit of additional N input (triangle EF) across all available data was significantly higher as compared to zero, indicating that the NO response to N additions increased significantly faster than the assumed linear. On average, upland grain crops showed significantly higher triangle EF than that of horticultural crops or lowland rice. A higher triangle EF was also appeared in sites with mean annual precipitation < 600 mm, mean annual temperature >= 15 degrees C, soil organic carbon >= 14 g C kg(- 1) or total N >= 1.4 g N kg(- 1), and where synthetic N fertilizers were usually applied. By assuming various N application rates, the IPCC default (0.7% or 1.1%) EF model would have overestimated or underestimated NO emissions compared to our triangle EF model. Overall, our meta-analysis results exert high potential to improve estimates of cropland NO inventories, and help address disparities in global NO budgets and develop more targeted mitigation efforts.

AB Increasing demand of commercial markets for tea products is driving the conversion from rice paddies to tea plantations in subtropical China. So far, however, little is known on how this land-use change, along with the age of plantation establishment, will affect the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHG) methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and the air-pollutant nitric oxide (NO). Thus, we measured CH4, N2O and NO fluxes over an entire year from two tea plantations (one- and five-year-old plantations) and a native rice-fallow system under two system specific nitrogen fertilizer options. On an annual scale, comparable or higher GHG emissions were measured for tea plantations as compared to the rice-fallow system. Besides the pollution swapping from CH4 being the dominating GHG in rice paddies to N2O in tea plantations, annual NO emissions increased significantly. Annual direct emission factors of N2O and NO in tea plantations were 2.47-5.80% and 2.00-3.99%, respectively, significantly higher than in the rice-fallow system (N2O: 1.05-2.05%; NO: 0.033-0.051%). Differences in N fertilizer inputs and soil environmental conditions (e.g., soil water regime, pH and organic carbon) due to contrasting managements of these systems and their interactions are clearly driving the stimulation of N2O and NO emissions and contributing to the significant CH4 reductions. Furthermore, we observed that increasing tea stand age, particularly under organic fertilization, further stimulated N2O and NO emissions that varied significantly intraannually. Nevertheless, the higher N2O and NO emissions of tea plantations and the increasing emission strength with stand age deserve further research attention and consideration for future land-use conversions.

AB Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) were determined from an intensively managed agricultural soil near Plymouth, in the coastal plain of North Carolina, using the dynamic chamber technique. The measurements were made over a soybean field from July 15 to August 15, 1996, as part of the project Natural Emissions of Oxidant Precursors: Validation of Techniques and Assessment (NOVA). A N-containing fertilizer was applied at the middle of the experiment in order to investigate the effect of N-fertilizers on NO emissions and to test the response of instruments. Soil water content was high during the experimental period, with water-filled pore space ranging from 49% to 67%. NO emission during this period ranged between 0.28 and 18.45 ng N m(-2) s(-1) with an overall average of 5.01 +/- 3.03 ng N m(-2) s(-1). A normal diurnal pattern with low values at nighttime and high values during the day was observed during the prefertilization period, but a reverse diurnal pattern (high at nighttime, low in daytime) of NO emission variation was found during the postfertilization, closed-canopy period, implying that interaction among canopy development, application of fertilization, and soil parameters may affect the diurnal variation of NO emission from soils. The emissions of NO were related to soil temperature, water-filled pore space, and extractable nitrogen. Application of fertilizer at the middle of the experiment was found to disrupt the normal relations between NO emission and soil temperature and water content seen during the prefertilization period bur to enhance the positive relation between NO emission and extractable N. An intercomparison of the dynamic chamber technique with the eddy-correlation technique in this experiment indicates that in spite of large differences in the magnitudes of soil NO emission and the NO flux at 5 m, the two fluxes show similar variations with time and are strongly correlated.

AB [1] Information from 846 N2O emission measurements in agricultural fields and 99 measurements for NO emissions was used to describe the influence of various factors regulating emissions from mineral soils in models for calculating global N2O and NO emissions. Only those factors having a significant influence on N2O and NO emissions were included in the models. For N2O these were (1) environmental factors (climate, soil organic C content, soil texture, drainage and soil pH); (2) management-related factors (N application rate per fertilizer type, type of crop, with major differences between grass, legumes and other annual crops); and (3) factors related to the measurements (length of measurement period and frequency of measurements). The most important controls on NO emission include the N application rate per fertilizer type, soil organic-C content and soil drainage. Calculated global annual N2O-N and NO-N emissions from fertilized agricultural fields amount to 2.8 and 1.6 Mtonne, respectively. The global mean fertilizer-induced emissions for N2O and NO amount to 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively, of the N applied. These overall results account for the spatial variability of the main N2O and NO emission controls on the landscape scale.

AB Quantification of greenhouse gases [nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4)] and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from subtropical conventional vegetable systems through multi-site field measurements are needed to obtain accurate regional and global estimates. N2O, NO and CH4 emissions from subtropical conventional vegetable systems were simultaneously measured at two different sites with hilly topography in the Sichuan basin, southwest China by using the static chamber gas chromatography technique. Results showed that annual soil N2O and NO fluxes for the treatment receiving N fertilizer ranged from 6.34-7.71 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.69-0.85 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, while decreased soil CH4 uptakes by 26.4% as compared with no N fertilizer addition across our two sites of experiment. Overall, the average direct N2O and NO emission factor (EFd) were 0.71% and 0.12%, respectively, which were both lower than the available EFd for subtropical conventional vegetable systems. This finding indicates that current regional and global estimates of N2O and NO emissions from vegetable fields are likely overestimated. Background N2O emissions (3.42-3.62 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) from the subtropical conventional vegetable systems were relatively high as compared with available field measurements worldwide, suggesting that background N2O emissions cannot be ignored for regional estimate of N2O emissions in subtropical region. Nevertheless, the significantly intra- and inter-annual variations in N2O, CH4 and NO emissions were also observed in the present study, which could be explained by temporal variations of environmental variables (i.e. soil temperature and moisture). The differences in N2O and NO EFd and CH4 emissions between various vegetable systems in particular under subtropical conditions should be taken into account when compiling regional or global inventories and proposing mitigation practices.

AB Results from the eddy covariance nitric oxide flux measurements made at a site on the Eastern Shore of Maryland during July 25-30, 1995 are reported. The mean (and median) NO flux measured along the dividing line between two fertilized cornfields, one conventionally-tilled and one untilled, was 7.5 (and 7.6) ng N m(-2) s(-1). Average NO emission rates from the untilled field, 1.2 (0.1-3.3) ng N m(-2) s(-1), were significantly lower than from the tilled field, 8.6 (2.5-15.5) ng N m(-2) s(-1), where the ranges in parentheses cover the central 90% of the data. This finding suggests that no-till agriculture might reduce NO emission from soils during the summer months. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Over 60 published papers reporting field measurements of emissions of nitric oxide (NO) from soil are reviewed, and over 100 annual estimates of NO emissions were made for various types of ecosystems, including agricultural fields. These data were stratified by biome and the mean of each stratum was multiplied by an estimate of the biome area. A few strata were identified as clearly having low NO emissions: montane forests, swamps and marshes, tundra, and temperate forests that are not heavily affected by N deposition. The largest emissions were observed in tropical savanna/woodland, chaparral, and cultivated agriculture, but variation in NO emissions within these strata was also large. Although the stratification scheme fails to partition this within-stratum variation, it does clearly identify these biomes as globally important sources of NO and as areas where more research is needed to investigate within-biome variation in NO emissions. It is too early to tell whether differences in NO emissions between temperate and tropical agriculture are significant, but it is clear that agriculture is an important source of NO and that management practices affect NO emissions. The best current estimate of the global soil source of NO is 21 Tg N yr(-1). Adsorption of NO, onto plant canopy surfaces may reduce emissions to the atmosphere to as low as 13 Tg N yr(-1), although the absorption effect is probably smaller than this. An error term for the global estimate is difficult to determine, but it is at least +/-4 and perhaps as large at +/-10 Tg N yr(-1). Hence, only modest progress has been made in narrowing uncertainties in the estimate of the global soil source of NO, although some published lower estimates appear unlikely. This inventory reconfirms that the soil source of NO is similar in magnitude to fossil fuel emissions of NOx. Further narrowing of the uncertainty of the estimate of global soil NO emissions will require more sophisticated and carefully chosen stratification schemes to address variation within biomes based on soil fertility, soil texture, climate, and management and will require linking this type of inventory and stratification with mechanistic models.

AB Soil water content has multiple effects on the emission of gaseous N oxides. To separate and characterize these effects, we monitored rates of CO2, NO, and N2O evolution and changes in inorganic N concentrations of soil under a factorial combination of three N treatments and three water treatments during a 10-day laboratory incubation study. Because the emission of NO from control and NH4NO3-amended soil varied with the rate of chemoautotrophic NH4+ oxidation and was virtually eliminated by a specific inhibitor of that process [nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)-pyridine)], we concluded that nitrification was the principal NO source over the entire tested range of soil water potentials ( - 10 to less than - 1000 kPa). Denitrification made no significant contribution to N oxide emissions from even the wettest soil, so nitrifiers were probably also responsible for the much smaller emission of N2O under all treatments. Slower ps diffusion in soil with highest, compared to lowest, water content caused a 3-fold reduction in the mean NO:NO3- product ratio of nitrification, suggesting that the NO produced by NH4+-oxidizers is further oxidized unless conditions permit its rapid escape to the atmosphere. Nitrapyrin also eliminated the brief burst of N oxide emissions that typically follows wetting of dry soil, indicating that chemoautotrophic NH4+ oxidation is also involved in this phenomenon despite the poor correlation of the burst's magnitude  With soil NH4+ or NO2- concentrations. A second burst of N oxide emissions from control or NH4NO3-amended soil with no inhibitor occurred only where desiccation reduced both NO and CO2 evolution to near zero prior to rewetting the soil after a 7-day drying cycle.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured from agricultural, forest and moorland environments, using chamber techniques. Maximum emissions of NO and N2O were measured from the agricultural soils shortly after fertiliser application (7 ng N2O-N  m-2 s-1 and 91 ng N2O-N m-2 s-1). For the non-agricultural soils the NO flux ranged from -0.3 to 0.5 ng N2O-N m-2 s-1 and the N2O flux ranged from 1 to 2.7 ng N2O-N m-2 s-1. Emissions, however, were increased 2 to 7 fold when N deposition (uplands) and N fixation (alder plantations) contributed to the pool of soil available N. The best predictors of the NO emission were soil NO3- and soil temperature, accounting for 60% of the variability observed. The prediction of N2O was less successful. Only 30% of the variability could be explained by the soil NO3- and the soil moisture content, soil temperature did not have a significant effect on the N2O emission.

AB High fertilizer input and nitric oxide (NO) emissions characterize the intensive vegetable production system. However, the amount, geographic distribution, and effective mitigation strategies of NO emissions over Chinese vegetable fields remain largely uncertain. In this study, we developed a data-driven estimate of NO emissions and their spatial pattern in Chinese vegetable fields based on the Random Forest (RF) model. Additionally, we conducted a field experiment in a subtropical vegetable field to investigate the effect of climate-smart practices on NO emissions. The RF model results showed that soil NO emissions from Chinese vegetable fields were sensitive to nitrogen application amount, soil clay content, and pH. The total NO emission from Chinese vegetable fields in 2018 was estimated to be 75.9 Gg NO-N. The urgency to reduce NO emissions in vegetable fields was higher in northern than in southern China. Our meta-analysis and field experiment results suggested that biochar amendment and replacing chemical fertilizers with bio-organic fertilizers were win-win climate-smart management practices for mitigating NO emissions while improving vegetable production. Overall, our study provided new insights into NO emissions in vegetable soil ecosystems and can facilitate the development of regional NO emission inventories and effective mitigation strategies. These findings highlight the importance of adopting sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices to reduce NO emissions and mitigate their adverse environmental impacts.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are detrimental reactive gaseous oxides of nitrogen. Excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers in cropping systems has significantly increased the emissions of these gases, causing adverse environmental consequences. Previous studies have demonstrated that biochar amendment can regulate soil-N dynamics and mitigate N losses, but they lacked simultaneous assessments of soil N2O and NO emissions. Thus, the factors influencing the emissions of nitrogen oxides are still unclear. Therefore, this study examined the impact of biochar application on simultaneous N2O and NO emissions based on 18 peer-reviewed papers (119 paired observations). A machine learning model (boosted regression tree model) was adopted to assess the potential influencing factors, such as soil properties, biochar characteristics, and field management conditions. The addition of biochar reduced N2O and NO emissions by 16.2% and 14.7%, respectively. Biochar with a high total carbon content and pH, from woody or herbaceous feedstock, pyrolyzed at a high temperature, applied at a moderate rate and to soil with a high-silt content, a moderate pH, and coarse texture, could simultaneously reduce soil N2O and NO emissions. Biochar amendment, thus, has the potential to lower the environmental impact of crop production. Furthermore, the influence of soil properties, biochar characteristics, and field management should be considered in the future to enhance the efficacy of biochar.

AB Infrequent soil wetting in deserts can induce large nitrogen (N) trace gas pulses; however, how other abiotic mechanisms interactively control the timing and magnitude of these pulses are not clear. In particular, production of nitric(NO) and nitrous (N2O) oxide may be differentially sensitive to temperature, carbon (C), and N availability. At a desert field site in Southern California, USA, we used an automated sensor system in 4 years of field campaigns to track NO and N2O pulse responses to experimental manipulations of C and N across a range of ambient temperatures and shrub fertile islands. We observed rapid onset and shorter duration of N2O pulses immediately after wetting compared to lagged and extended pulses of NO, suggesting preferential incorporation of N initially into N2O in anoxic microsites and then to NO as soils dry. We identified strong nitrogen limitation and exponential temperature dependence of NO pulses, particularly for soils located under shrubs. N2O pulses were less responsive to experimental manipulations but showed evidence of C and N colimitation as well as seasonal temperature differences. As atmospheric N deposition and temperatures continue to increase in desert systems, we can expect larger losses of N from soils as pulse-based emissions.

AB Climate change is increasing the variability of precipitation, altering the frequency of soil drying-wetting events and the distribution of seasonal precipitation. These changes in precipitation can alter nitrogen (N) cycling and stimulate nitric oxide (NO) emissions (an air pollutant at high concentrations), which may vary according to legacies of past precipitation and represent a pathway for ecosystem N loss. To identify whether precipitation legacies affect NO emissions, we excluded or added precipitation during the winter growing season in a Pinyon-Juniper dryland and measured in situ NO emissions following experimental wetting. We found that the legacy of both excluding and adding winter precipitation increased NO emissions early in the following summer; cumulative NO emissions from the winter precipitation exclusion plots (2750 +/- 972 mu g N-NO m(-2)) and winter water addition plots (2449 +/- 408 mu g N-NO m(-2)) were higher than control plots (1506 +/- 397 mu g N-NO m(-2)). The increase in NO emissions with previous precipitation exclusion was associated with inorganic N accumulation, while the increase in NO emissions with previous water addition was associated with an upward trend in microbial biomass. Precipitation legacies can accelerate soil NO emissions and may amplify ecosystem N loss in response to more variable precipitation.

AB Nitrification inhibitors (NIs) have been widely demonstrated to reduce soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from nitrogen (N)-fertilized croplands. However, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of NIs during the cold nongrowing season, especially the spring thaw - a period that may dominate the annual emissions. We conducted an experiment to examine the effects of three types of NIs (DCD, DMPP, and nitrapyrin) on soil N2O and NO emissions from a seasonally frozen cropland in northeast China in two experimental years with contrasting snowfall. In 2017-2018, DCD significantly decreased growing season N2O emissions by 54%, DMPP achieved a non-significant reduction of 32% but nitrapyrin had no inhibition effect. In the winter following this growing season, there was high snowfall and large pulses of N2O fluxes during spring thaw were observed across all treatments totaling 1.1-4.2 kg N ha(-1) and contributing 54-76% of annual emissions. NIs did not significantly affect the spring thaw emissions, which partly offset the decreased emissions during growing season, leading to an overall neutral effects of DCD and DMPP on N2O emissions when accounting for a complete year. In 2018-2019, there was less snowfall and spring thaw N2O emissions totaled just 0.32-0.64 kg N ha(-1) and contributed to only 13-40% of annual emissions. All three types of NIs significantly decreased the annual N2O emissions by 37-55%. Yet, this annual reduction was lower than that during the growing season (56-66%) due to the inefficacy of NIs to abate the spring thaw emissions. In particular, nitrapyrin significantly increased the spring thaw N2O emissions by 81% probably owing to higher residual fertilizer-N and carbon availibility. In contrast to N2O, NO fluxes during spring thaw were negligible in all years, and NIs application significantly decreased the annual NO emissions by 68-86% (except for nitrapyrin in 2017-2018). Low NO/N2O ratios and positive relationships of N2O fluxes with soil moisture and nitrate suggested that freeze-thaw induced N2O production mainly from denitrification, which might be stimulated by soil moisture from melting snow. Overall, our results highlight that changes in winter weatherO fluxes have been attributed to several mechanisms: physical release of the conditions, and particularly snow dynamics, could create large uncertainties in assessing the efficacy of soil N-oxide emissions mitigation strategies under climate change.

AB Information about soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions from subtropical forests is quite limited, and even less is known about the pulse emission of NO when wetting soils after a long period of dryness. In this study, we measured NO fluxes following wetting of dry soil in a broadleaf forest and a pine forest in subtropical China. Large pulses of NO fluxes were observed after soil wetting in both forests. NO fluxes increased significantly within 0.5 h following wetting in both forests and reached peak 1 and 4 h after soil wetting in the pine forest and the broadleaf forest, respectively. In the broadleaf forest, averaged peak flux of NO pulses was 157 ng N m(-2) s(-1), which was 8 times the flux value before wetting, and in the pine forest, the averaged peak flux was 135 ng N m-2 s-1, which was 15.5 times the flux value before wetting. The total pulses-induced NO emissions during the dry season were roughly estimated to be 29.4 mg N m(-2) in the broadleaf forest and 22.2 mg N m(-2) in the pine forest or made up a proportion of 4.6% of the annual NO emission in the broadleaf forest and 5.3% in the pine forest.

AB Global warming is projected to accelerate ecosystem nitrogen (N) loss via gaseous pathways, thereby decreasing N availability, a critical nutrient for primary productivity and carbon sequestration. However, the models forecasting this ecosystem N loss are based on laboratory experiments that are inherently uncertain and have had few in situ validations. Over 6 y, we measured similar to 200,000 soil nitric oxide (NO; an air pollutant) and nitrous oxide (N2O; a powerful greenhouse gas) fluxes and used an upscaling approach to estimate N-2 fluxes after warming a temperate forest by 2 degrees C. Against thermodynamic theoretical predictions, warming unequivocally lowered emissions of NO by 19% and of N2O by 16%. These lower gaseous N losses were not explained by complete reduction of NO and N2O to N-2, leaching, nor plant uptake, but rather by the warming-induced drying of soils that constrained microbial activity, consistent with other warming experiments where precipitation was less than 1,000 mm y(-1). Our findings challenge ecosystem model assumptions where warming, alone, accelerates N emissions and underscores how warming-induced losses in soil moisture and shortened freeze-thaw periods can offset temperature effects. Our data underscore the need for explicit consideration of in situ soil moisture when predicting changes on the terrestrial N cycle as the planet warms.

AB Because several soil properties and processes affect emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) from soils, it has been difficult to develop effective and robust algorithms to predict emissions of these gases in biogeochemical models. The conceptual "hole-in-the-pipe" (HIP) model has been used effectively to interpret results of numerous studies, but the ranges of climatic conditions and soil properties are often relatively narrow for each individual study. The Trace Gas Network (TRAGNET) database offers a unique opportunity to test the validity of one manifestation of the HIP model across a broad range of sites, including temperate and tropical climates, grasslands and forests, and native vegetation and agricultural crops. The logarithm of the sum of NO + N(2)O emissions was positively and significantly correlated with the logarithm of the sum of extractable soil NH,+ + NO(3)(-). The logarithm of the ratio of NO:N(2)O emissions was negatively and significantly correlated with water-filled pore space (WFPS). These analyses confirm the applicability of the HIP model concept, that indices of soil N availability correlate with the sum of NO+N(2)O emissions, while soil water content is a strong and robust controller of the ratio of NO:N(2)O emissions. However, these parameterizations have only broad-brush accuracy because of unaccounted variation among studies in the soil depths where gas production occurs, where soil N and water are measured, and other factors. Although accurate predictions at individual sites may still require site-specific parameterization of these empirical functions, the parameterizations presented here, particularly the one for WFPS, may be appropriate for global biogeochemical modeling. Moreover, this integration of data sets demonstrates the broad ranging applicability of the HIP conceptual approach for understanding soil emissions of NO and N(2)O.

AB Climate change is altering precipitation regimes that control nitrogen (N) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. In ecosystems exposed to frequent drought, N can accumulate in soils as they dry, stimulating the emission of both nitric oxide (NO; an air pollutant at high concentrations) and nitrous oxide (N2O; a powerful greenhouse gas) when the dry soils wet up. Because changes in both N availability and soil moisture can alter the capacity of nitrifying organisms such as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) to process N and emit N gases, predicting whether shifts in precipitation may alter NO and N2O emissions requires understanding how both AOA and AOB may respond. Thus, we ask: How does altering summer and winter precipitation affect nitrifier-derived N trace gas emissions in a dryland ecosystem? To answer this question, we manipulated summer and winter precipitation and measured AOA- and AOB-derived N trace gas emissions, AOA and AOB abundance, and soil N concentrations. We found that excluding summer precipitation increased AOB-derived NO emissions, consistent with the increase in soil N availability, and that increasing summer precipitation amount promoted AOB activity. Excluding precipitation in the winter (the most extreme water limitation we imposed) did not alter nitrifier-derived NO emissions despite N accumulating in soils. Instead, nitrate that accumulated under drought correlated with high N2O emission via denitrification upon wetting dry soils. Increases in the timing and intensity of precipitation that are forecasted under climate change may, therefore, influence the emission of N gases according to the magnitude and season during which the changes occur.

AB During October to December 1994, we measured diel and seasonal variability in nitric oxide (NO) exchange by a southern African savanna ecosystem (Grasslands Research Station, Marondera, Zimbabwe). A set of automated dynamic chambers was installed in three sub-sites: Miombo forest, natural grassland, and cropped soils (maize, sorghum, groundnut). The latter received a single application of commercialy available in-organic or cowdung fertilizer. The dynamic chamber system is described in detail, including correction of the resulting data for wall losses and gas-phase reactions of the NO-NO2-O-3 triad. During the dry season, net vertical NO fluxes were close to the detection limit (0.44 ngN m(-2)s(-1)) regardless of vegetation type. During the transition from dry to wet season strong ''pulsing'' effects of the NO flux were observed: NO emissions increased by a factor of up to 60 within hours. During the wet season, NO emissions varied between the different sub-sites of the ecosystem; corresponding means are in ranking order of fertilized agricultural plots (27.2 ngN m(-2) s(-1)), unfertilized agricultural plots (8.5 ngN m(-2) s(-1)), grassland (4.4 ngN m(-2) s(-1)), and Miombo forest (1.5 ngN m(-2) s(-1)). Soil moisture was found to be the dominant factor controlling the NO fluxes. Whenever it was not limiting, the diel behaviour of NO emission followed the daily variation of soil temperature measured 1 cm below the surface.

AB Biogenic soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO) were measured from an intensively managed agricultural row crop (corn, Zea mays) during a 4 week period (May 15 through June 9, 1995). The site was located in Washington County, near the town of Plymouth, which is in the Lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina. Soil NO flux was determined using a dynamic flow-through chamber technique. The measurement period was characterized by two distinguishing features: an application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer at the midpoint of the experiment and a nontypical rainfall pattern. Average NO flux prior to the application of N fertilizer was 31.5 +/- 10.1 np N m(-2) s(-1), and more than doubled (77.7 +/- 63.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) after the application of a side-dressing of N fertilizer. Average soil extractable nitrogen values did not change significantly following application of the side-dressing of N fertilizer. We attribute this failure to detect a significant difference in soil extractable nitrogen following N fertilization to the method in which the fertilizer was applied, the subsequent rainfall pattern, and the technique of soil sampling. NO flux followed the same diurnal trend as soil temperature, with maximum NO emissions coinciding with maximum soil temperature, and minimum NO emissions coinciding with minimum soil temperature. NO flux was found to increase exponentially with soil temperature, but only after fertilization. Due to subsurface irrigation practices employed by the farmer, changes in soil water content were minimal, and no relation could be drawn between soil water content and NO flux. Simultaneous measurements of NOy, NO2, and NO emissions revealed that NO and NO2 emissions represent 86 and 8.7%, respectively, of NOy emissions leaving the soil. Simultaneous NO flux measurements made by a closed box flux technique, at the same site, revealed no statistically significant differences between the two different methodologies for measuring NO flux.

AB Field operations of tillage and residue incorporation could have potentially important influences on N-trace gas fluxes, though poorly quantified. Here we studied the effects of straw incorporation in the preceding rice season and no-tillage prior to wheat sowing on nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during the non-rice period of a typical rice-wheat rotation in the Yangtze River Delta. Compared to conventional management practice (no straw incorporation along with rotary harrowing tillage to 10 cm before wheat sowing), straw incorporation alone decreased cumulative N2O emissions over the entire non-rice period by 32% (1.53 vs. 2.24 kg N ha(-1), P < 0.05) but did not affect NO emissions (0.88 vs. 0.87 kg N ha(-1)). In contrast, no-tillage alone increased N2O emissions by 75% (P < 0.05) while reducing NO emissions by 48% (P < 0.01). Combination of no-tillage and straw incorporation led to no change in N2O emissions but a reduction in NO emissions compared to the conventional management regime. The direct N2O emission factors (EF(d)s) of applied nitrogen fertilizers during the non-rice season ranged from 0.29% to 1.35% with a coefficient of variation (CV) as large as 68% among the investigated management regimes. The EF(d)s for NO ranged from 0.13% to 0.32% with a CV of 50%. Adoption of these new EFds will allow us to account for management effects on N-trace gas emissions when calculating emission inventories. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the uncertainty remains high, since the effects of soil properties such as texture or pH on management practices are not yet well defined. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The pond-ditch circulation system(PDCS) is an efficient and economical solution for the restoration of degraded ruralwater environments. However, little is known about nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions in the microbial removal process of nitrogen in PDCSs, and their contribution to nitrogen removal. The aim of this study was to quantify N2O and NO emissions from the PDCS, evaluate their capacities, and elucidate the key environmental factors controlling them. The results showed that N2O and NO fluxes were in the ranges 1.1-2055.1 mu g Nm(-2) h(-1) and 0.1-6.8 mu g Nm(-2) h(-1) for the PDCS, respectively. Meanwhile, the N2O and NO fluxes from the two ponds in the PDCS were significantly higher than those in the static system. Moreover, the amount of N2O and NO emissions in the PDCS accounted for 0.17-4.32% of the total nitrogen (TN) removal. According to the partial least squares (PLS) approach and Pearson's correlation coefficients, nitrate nitrogen in water (W-NO3-N), dissolved oxygen in water (W-DO), dissolved oxygen in sediment (DO), pH in water (W-pH), pH in sediment (pH), total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and soil organic carbon (SOC) significantly affected the N2O flux (p < 0.05), whereas W-NO3--N, DO, and nitrite nitrogen in sediment (NO2--N) significantly affected the NO emission (p < 0.05).

AB Urine was added under controlled conditions to intact turfs taken from long-term permanent pasture on clay loam and sandy loam soils in South West England. Methane exchanges were small (<+/-0.03 mu g CH4 m(-2) min(-1)) and overall absorption equalled or exceeded emission in both soils. On the clay loam, wetting with water or urine increased soil microbial biomass C and N contents by about 20% but there was no specific effect of urine. Urine, however, caused an increase in soil respiration of >50% and the average increase was greater for cow's urine (30.8 mg CO2 m(-2) min(-1)) than for an artificial urine (20.1 mg CO2 m(-2) min(-1)). Emissions of nitric and nitrous oxides following urine application were substantial (on average 0.36 mu g NO-N and 29 mu g N2O-N m(-2) min(-1)) but short lived (<40 days). The high levels of ammonium found in the urine treated soils (>200 mg NH4+-N kg(-1)) were nitrified to nitrate over a period of 42 days. Qualitative changes in the soil microbial biomass were evidently not related to biomass size. Relationships between trace gas emissions and soil processes are discussed.

AB Insufficient knowledge about soil nitrous and nitric oxide (N2O and NO) emissions from vegetable production limits our ability to constrain their atmospheric budget. Carrots (Daucus carota) are a globally important, heavily managed and irrigated, high-value horticultural crop. Although intensively fertilized carrots may be an important hot-spot source of N2O and NO emissions, we have little information on the response of soil N2O emissions to fertilization and no information on the NO emissions response. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a replicated field experiment on mineral soil in the Negev Desert. We grew carrots with drip irrigation, applying five fertilization levels, ranging between 0 and 400 kg N ha(-1). During one growth season we estimated responses of the soil N2O and NO emissions, partial crop N balance, and carrot yields to incremental fertilization levels. Carrot yield increased with increasing fertilization from 0 to 100 kg N ha(-1) and exhibited no further response thereafter. Soil N2O and NO emissions were similar at all fertilization levels and did not differ significantly from those in the unfertilized control. The estimated N budget was negative for all fertilization levels. Carrots incorporated 30-140 kg N ha(-1) into their belowground biomass and 120-285 kg N ha(-1) into their aboveground biomass per season.

AB Outdoor pot and field experiments were conducted to study the effect of controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions and wheat yields during the 2011-2013. Three treatments, namely conventional N fertilizer (CF; urea and compound fertilizer, 300 kg N ha(-1)), CRF (210 kg N ha(-1), which is 70% of the N applied in the CF treatment), and check (CK, 0 N), were applied in three replicates. The soil temperature, soil moisture, N uptake by wheat, wheat yield, and variations in NO3-N, NH4-N, N2O, and NO emissions were measured. Results showed that the average total N2O and NO emissions in the CRF treatment in the pot and field experiments decreased by 26.5 and 19.4%, respectively. The average N2O and NO emission factors decreased by 32.1 and 24.8%, respectively, compared with the CF treatment. However, the CRF wheat yields were insignificantly lower than those from the CF treatment. Results indicated that CRF could improve the efficiency of fertilizer N use, reduce labor cost, and increase economic benefit without sacrificing the yield.

AB Nitric oxide soil emission flux was measured by 2-2 parallel manual and auto dynamic chambers on hourly basis above a Hungarian semi-arid, sandy grassland between August 2012 and January 2014. The measured datasets covered 43-85% of time period depending on chambers. We applied a gap filling method based on multivariable analysis (Sigma Plot) combined with maximum likelihood method. Trend of gap filled dataset shows large peaks mostly in summer and early fall. When soil parameters are far from the optimum (dry, warm conditions), the fluxes are negligible. Application of manual chambers closed for longer period results in substantial positive bias in flux estimation compared to auto chambers as a consequence of measurement setup, different temperature, and drier soil conditions below the chamber. Mean fluxes applying permanently closed dynamic chambers are approximately three times higher compared to auto chambers: 0.176 +/- 0.489 nmol m(-2)s(-1) and 0.058 +/- 0.130 nmol m(-2)s(-1), respectively.

AB In field studies, forest soils in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Pica emitted greater amounts of nitric oxide (NO) than soils from pastures that had been actively grazed for over 20 years following their conversion from forest. We measured NO production from intact soil cores from these land uses. Laboratory tests using ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), water, and acetylene (C2H2) additions demonstrate a response consistent with field studies. Forest soil cores produced more NO than pasture cores regardless of treatment. In forest soil the response to NH4+ solution was significantly greater than response to water or an ambient moisture control. Addition of 10 kPa C2H2 caused a marked decrease in NO production in forest soil cores. These responses suggest a nitrification-linked control over NO production. Large and rapid responses to NO2- additions suggest that chemical decomposition of this ion may contribute to NO production. Pasture soil cores did not show a significant response to any of the treatments including NO2-. Low porosity in the pasture soils may restrict emission of NO produced therein.

AB Eleven types of agricultural soils were collected from Chinese uplands and paddy fields to compare their N2O and NO production by nitrification under identical laboratory conditions. Before starting the assays, all air-dried soils were preincubated for 4 weeks at 25 degreesC and 40% WFPS (water-filled pore space). The nitrification activities of soils were determined by adding (NH4)(2)SO4 (200 mg N kg(-1) soil) and incubating for 3 weeks at 25 degreesC and 60% WFPS. The net nitrification rates obtained fitted one of two types of models, depending on the soil pH: a zero-order reaction model for acidic soils and one neutral soil (Group 0); or a first-order reaction model for one neutral soil and alkaline soils (Group 1). The results suggest that pH is the most important factor in determining the kinetics of soil nitrification from ammonium. In the Group 1 soils, initial emissions (i.e. during the first week) of N2O and NO were 82.6 and 83.6%, respectively, of the total emissions during 3 weeks of incubation; in the Group 0 soils, initial emissions of N2O and NO were 54.7 and 59.9%, respectively, of the total emissions. The net nitrification rate in the first week and second-third weeks were highly correlated with the initial and subsequent emissions (i.e. during the second and third weeks), respectively, of N2O and NO. The average percentages of emitted (N2O + NO)-N relative to net nitrification N in initial and subsequent periods were 2.76 and 0.59 for Group 0, and 1.47 and 0.44 for the Group 1, respectively. The initial and subsequent emission ratios of NO/N2O from Group 0 (acidic) soils were 3.77 and 2.52 times, respectively, higher than those from Group 1 soils (P < 0.05). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Increasing demand for food and fibre by the growing human population is driving significant land use (LU) change from forest into intensively managed land systems in tropical areas. But empirical evidence on the extent to which such changes affect the soil-atmosphere exchange of trace gases is still scarce, especially in Africa. We investigated the effect of LU on soil trace gas production in the Mau Forest Complex region, Kenya. Intact soil cores were taken from natural forest, commercial and smallholder tea plantations, eucalyptus plantations and grazing lands, and were incubated in the lab under different soil moisture conditions. Soil fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were quantified, and we approximated annual estimates of soil N2O and NO fluxes using soil moisture values measured in situ. Forest and eucalyptus plantations yielded annual fluxes of 0.3-1.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) and 1.5-5.2 kg NO-N ha(-1) a(-1). Soils of commercial tea plantations, which are highly fertilized, showed higher fluxes (0.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) and 4.3 kg NO-N ha(-1) a(-1)) than smallholder tea plantations (0.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) and 2.1 kg NO-N ha(-1) a(-1)) or grazing land (0.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) and 1.1 kg NO-N ha(-1) a(-1)). High soil NO fluxes were probably the consequence of long-term N fertilization and associated soil acidification, likely promoting chemodenitrification. Our experimental approach can be implemented in understudied regions, with the potential to increase the amount of information on production and consumption of trace gases from soils.

AB Volatile reactive nitrogen oxides (NOy) are significant atmospheric pollutants, including NOx (nitric oxide [NO] + nitrogen dioxide [NO2]) and NOz (nitrous acid [HONO] + nitric acid [HNO3] + nitrogen trioxide [NO3] + ...). NOy species are products of nitrogen (N) cycle processes, particularly nitrification and denitrification. Biogenic sources, including soil, account for over 50% of natural NOy emissions to the atmosphere, yet emissions from soils are generally not included in atmospheric models as a result of a lack of mechanistic data. This work is a unique investigation of NOy fluxes on a landscape scale, taking a comprehensive set of land-use types, human influence, and seasonality into account to determine large-scale heterogeneity to provide a basis for future modeling and hypothesis generation. By coupling 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we have linked significant differences in functional potential and activity of nitrifying and denitrifying soil microbes to NOy emissions from soils. Further, we have identified soils subject to increased N deposition that are less microbially active despite increased available N, potentially as a result of poor soil health from anthropogenic pollution. Structural equation modeling suggests human influence on soils to be a more significant effector of soil NOy emissions than land-use type.

AB The emission of NO was parameterized using empirical relationships with landuse type, fertilization rate and soil temperature. Eight landuse types (including four arable lands) were considered. Fertilization rates were distinguished for different regions and crops. A typical summer period of July in 1999 was chosen for detailed calculations. The total NO emission in the July is 141.1 Gg N, with 73.7% from arable lands and 22.0% from grasslands. The highest emission intensity can be more than 40 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in the heavily fertilized North China Plain, and the average of the whole lands is 6.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1). The annual emission was roughly estimated to be 657 Gg N, about 11.7% of the global total (5600 Gg N, reported by IPCC in 2000), and about 12.5% of the anthropogenic origin in China. Our results were compared with some earlier findings, and uncertainties were discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Conversion of humid tropical forest to agriculture significantly alters trace gas emissions from soils. We report nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), and methane (CH4) fluxes from secondary forest soils prior to and during deforestation, and throughout the first agricultural cropping. Annual average nitrogen oxide emissions from forest soils were 1.5 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for N2O and 0.9 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for NO. Forest clearing increased the level of extractable nitrate in soils and average nitrogen oxides fluxes (2.7 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for N2O, and 8.1 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for NO). Immediately after biomass burning, short-term peaks of N2O and NO (123 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for N2O, and 41 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for NO) were superimposed on generally increased fluxes. Peak emissions declined within 3 days after burning. Postburn fluxes stayed higher than measured on adjacent forest sites for 3-4 months (averages for postburn fluxes were 17.5 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for N2O, and 19.2 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for NO). Increased N2O and NO emissions after clearing and until cropping were probably due to a combination of increased rates of nitrogen cycling and higher gaseous diffusion in drying soils. Compared to emissions from young pastures in the region, fluxes of nitrogen oxides from unfertilized agricultural areas were low (3.9 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for N2O and 3.4 ng N cm(-2) h(-1) for NO), probably due to nitrogen uptake by fast growing corn plants and losses by leaching with draining soil water in the wet season. Variation in CH4 fluxes was high for ail land use periods. Forest soils consumed an average of 1.0 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), which slightly increased in drier soils after clearing (1.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Postburn CH4 consumption by soils was slightly reduced (0.8 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) compared to forest soils. Unfertilized agricultural soils consumed less CH4 than forest soils.

AB Anthropogenic emissions from industrial and automotive sources within the confines of the city of Raleigh, NC have been documented by the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources, Division of Environmental Management, but no direct biogenic emissions of nitric oxide (NO) from soils has yet been measured. In this study, emissions of NO were measured in Raleigh, NC, and its surrounding suburbs, in an attempt to determine the portion of the total NOx (= NO + NO2) budget which can be attributed to biogenic sources. Residential and commercial lawns, and golf courses receiving normal fertilizer applications were chosen as the primary biogenic source of NO. Soil NO fluxes were measured using a dynamic chamber technique from 11 sites and ranged in value (hourly averages calculated from 15 min readings) from 1.24 to 23.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1). These hour averages were then combined with estimates of lawn acreage within the city proper, and in the surrounding suburbs, in order to develop a budget for biogenic NO emissions in Raleigh. This budget was then compared to the budget used in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regional Oxidant-Model (ROM) for photochemical modeling. Results from this comparison suggest that less than 1% of the total NOx budget for Raleigh, NC is emitted by natural processes, and that approximately 1.2% of the nitrogen applied as fertilizer is lost via soil NO emissions. Thus, the effects of biogenic NO may be neglected in the development of a reliable plan for reducing ozone in the urban atmosphere. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) were determined during late spring and summer 1995 and the spring of 1996 from four agricultural soils on which four different crops were grown. These agricultural soils were located at four different sites throughout North Carolina. Emission rates were calculated using a dynamic flow-through chamber system coupled to a mobile laboratory for in-situ analysis. Average NO fluxes during late spring 1995 were: 50.9 +/- 47.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) from soil planted with corn in the lower coastal plain. Average NO fluxes during summer 1995 were: 6.4 +/- 4.6 and 20.2 +/- 19.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively, from soils planted with corn and soybean in the coastal region; 4.2 +/- 1.7 nq N m(-2) S-1 from soils planted with tobacco in the piedmont region; and 8.5 +/- 4.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1) from soils planted with corn in the upper piedmont region. Average NO fluxes for spring 1996 were: 66.7 +/- 60.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) from soils planted with wheat in the lower coastal plain; 9.5 +/- 2.9 ng N m-(2) s(-1) from soils planted with wheat in the coastal plain; 2.7 +/- 3.4 ng N m(-2) s(-1) from soils planted with wheat in the piedmont region; and 56.1 +/- 53.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) from soils planted with corn in the upper piedmont region. An apparent increase in NO flux with soil temperature was present at all of the locations. The composite data from all the research sites revealed a general positive trend of increasing NO flux with soil water content. In general, increases in total extractable nitrogen (TEN) appeared to be related to increased NO emissions within each site, however a consistent trend was not evident across all sites.

AB Fertilized soils have large potential for production of soil nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO+NO2), however these emissions are difficult to predict in high-temperature environments. Understanding these emissions may improve air quality modelling as NOx contributes to formation of tropospheric ozone (O-3), a powerful air pollutant. Here we identify the environmental and management factors that regulate soil NOx emissions in a high-temperature agricultural region of California. We also investigate whether soil NOx emissions are capable of influencing regional air quality. We report some of the highest soil NOx emissions ever observed. Emissions vary nonlinearly with fertilization, temperature and soil moisture. We find that a regional air chemistry model often underestimates soil NOx emissions and NOx at the surface and in the troposphere. Adjusting the model to match NOx observations leads to elevated tropospheric O-3. Our results suggest management can greatly reduce soil NOx emissions, thereby improving air quality.

AB Urban turfgrass ecosystems are expected to increase at unprecedented rates in upcoming decades, due to the increasing population density and urban sprawl worldwide. However, so far urban turfgrasses are among the least understood of all terrestrial ecosystems concerning their impact on biogeochemical N cycling and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes. In this study, we aimed to characterize and quantify annual N2O and NO fluxes from urban turfgrasses dominated by either C4, warm-season species or C3, cool-season and shadeenduring species, based on year-round field measurements in Beijing, China. Our results showed that soil N2O and NO fluxes varied substantially within the studied year, characterizing by higher emissions during the growing season and lower fluxes during the non-growing season. The regression model fitted by soil temperature and soil water content explained approximately 50%-70% and 31%-38% of the variance in N2O and NO fluxes, respectively. Annual cumulative emissions for all urban turfgrasses ranged from 0.75 to 1.27 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O and from 0.30 to 0.46 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for NO, both are generally higher than those of Chinese natural grasslands. Non-growing season fluxes contributed 17%-37% and 23%-30% to the annual budgets of N2O and NO, respectively. Our results also showed that compared to the cool-season turfgrass, annual N2O and NO emissions were greatly reduced by the warm-season turfgrass, with the high root system limiting the availability of inorganic N substrates to soil microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification. This study indicates the importance of enhanced N retention of urban turfgrasses through the management of effective species for alleviating the potential environmental impacts of these rapidly expanding ecosystems.

AB Nitrogen (N) fertilizer has shown to affect soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions that contribute to global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. However, soil N2O and NO emissions with a linkage to crop N use efficiency (NUE) under different fertilization strategies in winter wheat-summer rice rotation systems remain yet to be further examined. Here, we carried out a two-year field study to assess the response of soil N2O and NO emissions as an interplay with NUE to different fertilization strategies in a typical winter wheat-summer rice rotation cropland of subtropical China. Three fertilizer treatments were established consisting of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer application (PK), NPK fertilizer application (NPK), and NPK fertilizer application with N partially replaced with manure (NPKM). Annual N2O, NO and N2O + NO emissions averaged 0.96, 0.24 and 1.19 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the PK plots and 6.54, 1.48 and 8.03 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the NPK plots, respectively. Relative to the NPK plots, partially replacing chemical N fertilizer with manure decreased annual N2O and NO emissions and their combined emissions by 13-15%, while it significantly enhanced crop NUE as compared to the NPK plots. Annual mean emission factors (EFs) of N fertilizer for N2O and NO were estimated to be 1.17% and 0.26% for the NPK plots, and 0.99% and 0.22% for the NPKM plots, respectively. Both N2O and NO emissions were positively correlated with N surplus, while yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions and the fertilizer N-induced combined EF for N2O + NO were negatively related to crop NUE. Together, our results highlight that improving crop NUE while reducing soil N surplus constitutes an effective strategy to mitigate soil gaseous N loss through N2O and NO in the wheat-rice rotation cropping systems.

AB In order to reduce soil and environmental quality degradation associated with the use of synthetic nitrogen (N), substituting chemical fertilizer with organic or bio-organic fertilizer has become an increasingly popular option. However, components of this fertilizer strategy related to mitigation of soil N-oxide emissions and maintenance of crop yield remain uncertain. Here, we evaluated the effects of three different fertilizer strategies, with equal amounts of N, on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, vegetable yield, and yield-scaled N2O and NO emissions under three consecutive cucumber growing seasons. The three treatments were chemical fertilizer (NPK, urea), organic fertilizer (O, composted cattle manure), and bio-organic fertilizer (O + T, O combined with Trichoderma.spp). Results showed that the NPK plot had the highest area-scaled emissions of N2O (13.1 +/- 0.48 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and NO (5.01 +/- 0.34 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), which were 1.3-1.4 and 3.1-3.7 times greater than the O and O + T plots, respectively. The annual direct emission factors for N2O and NO were 2.08% and 0.92% for the NPK plot, which declined to 1.34% and 0.09% in the O plot, and 1.12% and 0.03% in the O + T plot, respectively. The annual vegetable yield was 117 +/- 2.9 t ha(-1) for NPK plot and 122 +/- 2.0 t ha(-1) for O + T plot, which was higher than 111 +/- 1.7 t ha(-1) for O plot. The yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions differed significantly with fertilization treatment, with the lowest value observed in the O + T plot. We attributed the lower soil N-oxide emissions following organic fertilizer application to the slow release of available N and enhanced denitrification caused by the increase of soil dissolved organic carbon and pH. Compared with the use of organic fertilizer alone, the addition of Trichoderma.spp significantly increased the potential denitrification rate but decreased N2O emissions, which may have promoted the reduction of N2O to N-2. Therefore, our results suggest that adopting composted organic fertilizer mixtures with microbial inoculants could be a win-win practice to mitigate gaseous N losses and simultaneously improve crop yield in intensively managed vegetable cropping systems.

TI Response of nitric and nitrous oxide fluxes to N fertilizer application

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

AB It is of great concern worldwide that active nitrogenous gases in the global nitrogen cycle contribute to regional and global-scale environmental issues. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are generally interrelated in soil nitrogen biogeochemical cycles, while few studies have simultaneously examined these two gases emission from typical croplands. Field experiments were conducted to measure N2O and NO fluxes in response to chemical N fertilizer application in annual greenhouse vegetable cropping systems in southeast China. Annual N2O and NO fluxes averaged 52.05 and 14.87 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) for the controls without N fertilizer inputs, respectively. Both N2O and NO emissions linearly increased with N fertilizer application. The emission factors of N fertilizer for N2O and NO were estimated to be 1.43% and 1.15%, with an annual background emission of 5.07 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 1.58 kg NO-N ha(-1), respectively. The NO-N/N2O-N ratio was significantly affected by cropping type and fertilizer application, and NO would exceed N2O emissions when soil moisture is below 54% WFPS. Overall, local conventional input rate of chemical N fertilizer could be partially reduced to attain high yield of vegetable and low N2O and NO emissions in greenhouse vegetable cropping systems in China.

AB Nitric oxide emissions from a typical rice-wheat rotation system in southeastern China were continuously measured with an automatic system in 1996-1997. The seasonal pattern of the NO emissions was characterized for the non-waterlogged period of a rotation cycle. Nitric oxide emissions during the period from March through June were 3.9-6.3 folds for the fertilized plots and 1.6 folds for the unfertilized plot larger than those from November through December. Nitric oxide emissions were not detectable during the winter period from January through February. Amendment of synthetic fertilizer N significantly enhanced the NO emission by a factor of 6.5, but the enhancement was significantly mitigated by 25% through substituting ca. 16% of the synthetic fertilizer N with organic N from fermented crop residues or by 21% through deep tillage. The NO-N emission factor, defined as the amount of NO-N released per unit of synthetic fertilizer N input, was determined to be 0.025 kg NO-N kg (-1) of N applied for the non-waterlogged period, which was reduced by 32% through substituting part of the synthetic N fertilizer with fermented crop residues or by 24% through deep tillage. In addition, the NO emission factor, defined as the amount of NO-N emitted from unit unfertilized area per day, was observed to be ca. 3.8 g N ha (-1) d (-1) . Approximately 0.55 Tg N yr (-1) was likely released as NO from Chinese cultivated lands.

AB Soils are a significant source for atmospheric NO. However, due to the limited number of measurements and in view of the high temporal and spatial variability of NO emissions, as originating from dependencies from a series of environmental constraints such as soil properties, meteorology or N fertilization, inventories of soil NO emissions are still highly uncertain. In this work, the agricultural DNDC model was modified and applied on site scale in order to evaluate its capability to simulate soil NO emissions. DNDC captured differences in the magnitude of NO emissions between sites, but was less successful when simulating observed day-by-day variations. However, major peak emission events, e.g. due to fertilizer application or following rainfall events, were mostly simulated. DNDC as well as its forest version Forest-DNDC were finally linked to a GIS to calculate NO emissions from agricultural and forest soils across Europe. Using the same databases for agricultural soils, we also compared our estimate with other commonly used methodologies (Skiba-EMEP/CORINAIR, Yienger and Levy, Stehfest and Bouwman). A canopy reduction factor was not applied in this study. Estimates for NO emissions for agricultural soils for EU15 states varied in a range of 48.9-189.8 kt NO-N for the year 2000 depending on the approach used (Yienger and Levy > DNDC > Stehfest and Bouwman > Skiba-EMEP/CORINAIR). For forests, using the model Forest-DNDC as the only approach, we calculated soil NO emissions to be 75.1 kt NO-N yr(-1). The results show that soils in EU15 states are significant sources of atmospheric NOx though the share of soil NO emissions on total NOx emissions (incl. NOx emissions by combustion processes) in EU15 was only 4-6%. Given that soil NO emissions are largely driven by the availability of inorganic nitrogen (fertilization) and temperature, emissions are larger during the vegetation period. Especially during early summer when fertilizer-induced NO emissions from agricultural soils are peaking, the contribution of soil emissions to total NOx emissions may most likely be well above 10%.

AB Soils are important sources of emissions of nitrogen-containing (N-containing) gases such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrous acid (HONO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia (NH3). However, most contemporary air quality models lack a mechanistic representation of the biogeo-chemical processes that form these gases. They typically use heavily parameterized equations to simulate emissions of NO independently from NH3 and do not quantify emissions of HONO or N2O. This study introduces a mechanistic, process-oriented representation of soil emissions of N species (NO, HONO, N2O, and NH3) that we have recently implemented in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The mechanistic scheme accounts for biogeochemical processes for soil N transformations such as mineralization, volatilization, nitrification, and denitrification. The rates of these processes are influenced by soil parameters, meteorology, land use, and mineral N availability. We account for spatial heterogeneity in soil conditions and biome types by using a global dataset for soil carbon (C) and N across terrestrial ecosystems to estimate daily mineral N availability in nonagricultural soils, which was not accounted for in earlier parameterizations for soil NO. Our mechanistic scheme also uses daily year-specific fertilizer use estimates from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC v0509) agricultural model. A soil map with sub-grid biome definitions was used to represent conditions over the continental United States. CMAQ modeling for May and July 2011 shows improvement in model performance in simulated NO2 columns compared to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite retrievals for regions where soils are the dominant source of NO emissions. We also assess how the new scheme affects model performance for NOx (NO + NO2), fine nitrate (NO3) particulate matter, and ozone observed by various ground-based monitoring networks. Soil NO emissions in the new mechanistic scheme tend to fall between the magnitudes of the previous parametric schemes and display much more spatial heterogeneity. The new mechanistic scheme also accounts for soil HONO, which had been ignored by parametric schemes.

AB Soil exchanges of greenhouse and other gases are poorly known for Pacific Northwest forests where gradients in nutrient availability and soil moisture may contribute to large variations in fluxes. Here we report fluxes of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) over multiple seasons from three naturally N-rich, aggrading forests of coastal Oregon, USA. Mean methane uptake rates (3.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were high compared with forests globally, negatively related to water-filled pore space (WFPS), but unrelated to N availability or temperature. Emissions of NO (6.0 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)) exceeded N2O (1.4 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)), except when WFPS surpassed 55%. Spatial variation in NO fluxes correlated positively with soil nitrate concentrations (which generally exceeded ammonium concentrations, indicating the overall high N status for the sites) and negatively with soil pH, and at one site increased with basal area of N-2-fixing red alder. Combined NO and N2O emissions were greatest from the site with highest annual net N mineralization and lowest needle litterfall C/N. Our findings of high CH4 uptake and NO/N2O ratios generally >1 most likely reflect the high porosity of the andic soils underlying the widespread regenerating forests in this seasonally wet region.

AB The application to soil of different slurry particle size fractions may lead to variable gaseous soil emissions and associated differential environmental impacts. An incubation experiment was carried out during 70 d to assess the influence on nitric oxide (NO) and greenhouse gas (GHG; i.e. nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane) emissions following incorporation of 4 particle size fractions, obtained through laboratorial separation from cattle slurry, to agricultural sandy loam soil (Dystric Cambisol). The response to these applied slurry fractions (>2000 mu m, 2000-500 mu m, 500-100 mu m, <100 mu m) was compared to other experimental treatments, including whole slurry (WS), ammonium sulphate (AS) and an unamended control (CON). The highest value of cumulated NO emissions (6.3 mg NO-N kg(-1) dry soil) were observed from the AS treatment. The cumulated amount of NO emitted (similar to 1 mg NO-N kg(-1) dry soil) was not significantly different between slurry fractions, thereby indicating that slurry particle size had no effect on NO emissions. The largest slurry fraction (>2000 pin) induced significantly higher N2O emissions (1.8 mg N2O-N kg(-1) dry soil) compared to the other smaller sized fractions (1.0 mg N2O-N kg(-1) dry soil). The >2000 pm, fraction, being more than 55% of the slurry by weight, was the major contributor to daily and cumulative N2O emissions. Hence, for N2O, the application of WS to agricultural soil is a better option that amendment with the >2000 gm, fraction. Low CH4 emissions (<200 mu g CH4-C kg(-1) dry soil d(-1)) were observed, but only in treatments amended with slurry or its fractions. The CH4 emissions were short-lived and rates returned to control levels within 3 d after the slurry application. Higher CO2 emissions were observed in soils amended with slurry fractions when compared to application with whole slurry. Clearly, slurry separation can increase soil CO2 emissions relative to whole slurry application. Overall, N2O contributed 10-30% to total GHG emissions, while that of methane was negligible. The present study suggested that mechanical separation of slurry into fractions and targeted application of the finest fractions to soil is a potential suitable management tool to reduce GHG emissions. However, the largest fractions have to be used for other purposes as anaerobic digestion rather than applied to soil. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing evidence has been found that chemical reactions affect significantly the terrestrial nitrogen (N) cycle, which was previously assumed to be mainly dominated by biological processes. Due to the limitation of knowledge and analytical techniques, it is currently challenging to discern the contribution of biotic and abiotic processes to the terrestrial N cycle for geobiologists and biogeochemists alike. To better understand the role of abiotic reactions in the terrestrial N cycle, it is necessary to comprehend the chemical controls on nitrogenous trace gas emissions and N retention in soil under various environmental conditions. In this manuscript, we assess the role of abiotic reactions in nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions as well as N retention through a meta-analysis using all related peer-reviewed publications before August 2020. Results show that abiotic reactions contributed 29.3-37.7% and 44.0-57.0% to the total N2O emission and N retention, representing 3.7-4.7 and 4.0-6.0 Tg year(-1) of global terrestrial N2O emission and N retention, respectively. Much higher NO production was observed in sterilized soils than that in unsterilized treatments indicating the major contribution of chemical reactions to NO emission and rapid microbial reduction of NO to N2O and N-2. Chemical hydroxylamine oxidation accounts for the largest abiotic contribution to N2O emission, while chemical nitrite reduction and fixation represent for the largest contribution to abiotic NO production and soil N retention, respectively. Factors influencing the abiotic processes include pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N), and transition metals. These results broadened our knowledge about the mechanisms involved in chemical N reactions and provided a simplified estimation about their contribution to nitrogenous trace gas emission and N retention, which is meaningful to further study interactions of biologically and chemically mediated reactions in biogeochemical N cycle.

AB Agricultural soil is a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3). Little information is available on emissions of these gases from soils amended with organic fertilizers at different soil water contents. N2O, NO and NH3 emissions were measured in large-scale incubations of a fresh sandy loam soil and amended with four organic fertilizers, [poultry litter (PL), composted plant residues (CP), sewage sludge pellets (SP) and cattle farm yard manure (CM)], urea fertilizer (UA) or a zero-N control (ZR) for 38 days. Fertilizers were added to soil at 40, 60 or 80% water-filled pore space (WFPS). The results showed that urea and organic fertilizer were important sources of N2O and NO. Total N2O and NO emissions from UA ranged from 0.04 to 0.62%, and 0.23 to 1.55% of applied N, respectively. Total N2O and NO emissions from organic fertilizer treatments ranged from 0.01 to 1.65%, and <0.01 to 0.55% of applied N, respectively. The lower N2O and NO emissions from CP and CM suggested that applying N is these forms could be a useful mitigation option. Comparison of the NO-N/N2O-N ratio suggested that nitrification was more dominant in UA whereas denitrification was more dominant in the organic fertilizer treatments. Most N was lost from PL and UA as NH3, and this was not influenced significantly by WFPS. Emissions of NH3 from UA and PL ranged from 62.4 to 69.6%, and 3.17 to 6.11% of applied N, respectively.

AB Data on the emissions of oxides of nitrogen from the soil during the early part of the wet season are reported for nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sandy soils at Nylsvley, South Africa. The emissions of NOx and N2O following the first wetting event of the season are elevated relative to subsequent events. The observed high emission rates (76 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1)) are partially attributed to the sandiness of the soil, which permits NO to diffuse out of the soil rapidly. The pulse of high emissions following wetting is maintained for approximately 72 hours, thereafter continuing at around 20 ng NO m(-2) s(-1) while the soil remains moist. The initial pulse is suggested to be due to the accumulation of a substrate pool during the dry period, coupled with an inability of plants and microbes to use it effectively during the first few days after wetting. There were no significant differences in the peak or subsequent emission rates for either NO or N2O between two sites of differing nitrogen mineralisation potentials. N2O emissions averaged 8% of NOx emissions. The enhanced emissions of NOx which follow the first wetting after a prolonged dry period do not make a very large contribution to the annual gaseous N emission budget, but could be a significant contributor to the high tropospheric ozone levels observed over southern Africa in springtime.

AB Tropical soils are potentially the highest and least studied nitrous oxide (N2O) production areas in the world. The effect of water, nitrate and glucose additions on profile concentrations and episodic emissions of N2O for two volcanic soils in Costa Rica was examined. Magnitudes of episodic N2O pulses, as well as overall N2O emissions, varied considerably and consistently, depending on soil texture, soil water content, and kind and availability of substrates. Emission pulses began within 30 min, peaking no later than 8 h after wetting. Production in the soil occurred mainly in the layer between 5 and 20 cm deep, but depended directly on the temporal dynamics of the water profile. Changes in soil NO3- were associated with soil N2O concentration changes. Depending on the treatments, one episodic N2O production event driven by one moderate rain could account for less than 15% to more than 90% of the total weekly production. Previous survey studies may have underestimated the contribution of N2O emissions from tropical soils. In order to improve budgets and models of N2O emissions. episodic emissions driven by rain events and amendments must be considered.

AB We conducted multi-year observations of nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from typical vegetable fields in the Yangtze River delta, which is located in southeastern China. Flux measurements were performed manually twice per week at intervals of 2-3 days, in both fertilized and unfertilized fields, over an investigation period of 1448 days (September 2004-August 2008). In total, twelve vegetable-growing periods and a short fallow period were investigated. On average, the NO fluxes from the fertilized plots were 21 times higher than fluxes from the unfertilized plots (p < 0.001). Peak NO emissions usually occurred soon after the addition of nitrogenous fertilizer. Peak emissions took place during about 15% of the whole investigation time, but contributed to approximately 89% of the total NO release. The annual background NO emissions (from fields without nitrogen amendment) were observed at 0.290 +/- 0.019 (standard deviation of 3 observations) kg N ha(-1). The total amounts of NO emitted during the individual vegetable-growing periods correlated positively and exponentially with the products of seasonal mean soil temperatures and nitrogen addition rates (R-2 = 0.87, p < 0.001). The mean direct NO emission factor (EFd, the loss rate of fertilizer nitrogen via NO emissions) for the four-year period was determined to be 0.51% +/- 0.11% (standard error of 3 observations). The EF(d)s of individual vegetable-growing seasons ranged from 0.05% to 1.24%, varying linearly and positively with the products of seasonal mean soil temperatures and nitrogen addition rates (R-2 = 0.58, p < 0.01). The observed interaction of soil temperature and nitrogen addition on NO emission in seasonal totals and EF(d)s occurred in soils with moisture contents ranging from 55% to 100% water-filled pore space (mean: 79%; standard deviation: 9%). The results of this study indicate that when other conditions remain relatively stable, the direct emission factor, a key parameter for compiling an inventory of NO emissions from vegetable fields, may vary with not only soil temperature but also nitrogen addition.

AB Acidic subtropical forest soils, receiving high atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, are characterized by fast N turnover, making them potential "hot spots" for nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Production of NO in soils is mediated by microbial nitrification and denitrification and/or chemical decomposition of microbially produced nitrite (NO2-). In monsoonal forests, soil microbial processes are exposed to strong soil moisture and temperature fluctuations, known to cause pronounced variability in NO emission. We quantified in situ fluxes of NO throughout two summers in the N-saturated TieShanPing forest, Chongqing, SW China. Additional N2O measurements were carried out in the second summer to infer likely source processes. To address spatial variability, fluxes were measured along two transects, one covering well-drained Acrisols on a forested hill slope, and the other hydrologically connected terraces with poorly drained Cambisols situated in a groundwater discharge zone. Hill slope sites emitted on average 48.4 +/- 60.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) in the relatively wet summer of 2015 and 88.4 +/- 94.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) in the dry summer of 2016, illustrating the strong effect of soil moisture regime. The NO emission in the groundwater discharge zone, measured in the dry summer of 2016 only, while it was flooded in the summer of 2015, was significantly smaller (26.4 +/- 52.7 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). The mean N2O-N emission on the hillslope (18.1 +/- 13.9 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) was smaller than NO-N flux, while it was larger (38.3 +/- 39.3 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) in the groundwater discharge zone. The temporal variability of the NO flux was largely explained by soil moisture fluctuations, whereas soil organic matter pool sizes contributed most to spatial variability. Hourly measurements showed that the NO flux doubled with 8 degrees C increase of soil temperature, indicating that soil temperature was another important driver for NO emissions. Our study indicates that acid N-saturated subtropical forest soils are a large source for NO, particularly during dry summers.

AB The direct measurement of denitrification dynamics and its product fractions is important for parameterizing process-oriented model(s) for nitrogen cycling in various soils. The aims of this study are to a) directly measure the denitrification potential and the fractions of nitrogenous gases as products of the process in laboratory, b) investigate the effects of the nitrate (NO (3) (-) ) concentration on emissions of denitrification gases, and c) test the hypothesis that denitrification can be a major pathway of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) production in calcic cambisols under conditions of simultaneously sufficient supplies of carbon and nitrogen substrates and anaerobiosis as to be found to occur commonly in agricultural lands.
   Using the helium atmosphere (with or without oxygen) gas-flow-soil-core technique in laboratory, we directly measured the denitrification potential of a silt clay calcic cambisol and the production of nitrogen gas (N-2), N2O and NO during denitrification under the conditions of seven levels of NO (3) (-) concentrations (ranging from 10 to 250 mg N kg(-1) dry soil) and an almost constant initial dissolved organic carbon concentration (300 mg C kg(-1) dry soil).
   Almost all the soil NO (3) (-) was consumed during anaerobic incubation, with 80-88 % of the consumed NO (3) (-) recovered by measuring nitrogenous gases. The results showed that the increases in initial NO (3) (-) concentrations significantly enhanced the denitrification potential and the emissions of N-2 and N2O as products of this process. Despite the wide range of initial NO (3) (-) concentrations, the ratios of N-2, N2O and NO products to denitrification potential showed much narrower ranges of 51-78 % for N-2, 14-36 % for N2O and 5-22 % for NO.
   These results well support the above hypothesis and provide some parameters for simulating effects of variable soil NO (3) (-) concentrations on denitrification process as needed for biogeochemical models.

AB The nitrogen-fixing legume kudzu (Pueraria montana) is a widespread invasive plant in the southeastern United States with physiological traits that may lead to important impacts on ecosystems and the atmosphere. Its spread has the potential to raise ozone levels in the region by increasing nitric oxide (NO) emissions from soils as a consequence of increasing nitrogen (N) inputs and cycling in soils. We studied the effects of kudzu invasions on soils and trace N gas emissions at three sites in Madison County, Georgia in 2007 and used the results to model the effects of kudzu invasion on regional air quality. We found that rates of net N mineralization increased by up to 1,000%, and net nitrification increased by up to 500% in invaded soils in Georgia. Nitric oxide emissions from invaded soils were more than 100% higher (2.81 vs. 1.24 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1)). We used the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to evaluate the potential impact of kudzu invasion on regional atmospheric chemistry and air quality. In an extreme scenario, extensive kudzu invasion leads directly to an increase in the number of high ozone events (above 70 ppb) of up to 7 days each summer in some areas, up from 10 to 20 days in a control scenario with no kudzu invasion. These results establish a quantitative link between a biological invasion and ozone formation and suggest that in this extreme scenario, kudzu invasion can overcome some of the air quality benefits of legislative control.

AB Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are key atmospheric trace gases that affect air quality, oxidation chemistry, and nitrogen deposition. Although anthropogenic NOx emissions have declined due to regulations, natural sources like soil emissions are becoming relatively more important. Biomass burning can alter soil nitrogen cycling and potentially influence soil NO fluxes, yet few controlled studies exist. Here, we examined how prescribed burning affects soil NO emissions in a South Carolina forest using incubation experiments. The study site is a sandhill ecosystem dominated by upland oak and longleaf pine, with fire-adapted understory vegetation including wiregrass. Soil cores were collected before and after burns of varying intensities. Measured soil pH, nitrate, and ammonium showed no consistent differences between pre- and post-burn conditions. NO fluxes, quantified using a custom soil chamber, averaged 0.056 +/- 0.068 ng-N h-1 g-1 with no significant burn-related change, and most values remained below the method detection limit of 0.137 ng-N h-1 g-1. However, ammonium nitrate additions triggered significant NO emissions, highlighting nitrogen availability as a key control. Scaling fluxes to the state level, we estimate natural forest soil contributed an estimated 700 +/- 800 metric tons of NO during a summer month, which is about 5.0 +/- 6.0% of statewide NO emissions. These results suggest that prescribed fire does not enhance soil NO emissions in nitrogen-limited, acidic southeastern U.S. forests, immediately following fire events. Moreover, they indicate that forest soil emissions are likely a minor contributor to regional NO budgets in this region.

AB Aims Soils are known to be significant sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), a key compound in atmospheric chemistry. NO is a key regulating substance for inter- and intra-species signalling and competition and affects plant growth and soil microbial metabolisms. However, little is known about NO concentration in soils and production of NO in the soil profile. Methods Here we report on soil NO concentrations down to 65 cm soil depth and soil surface flux measurements over a 15 months period in subdaily resolution. This is supplemented by information on aerobic and anaerobic NO production in various soil layers of a spruce stand in SW Germany. Results NO concentrations showed a clear seasonality with highest concentrations of up to 800 nmol mol(-1) (or part per billion in volume mixing ratio; ppbv) at the interface between the organic Of-Oh sub-layers in the summer. NO concentrations in the mineral subsoil (-65 cm) were approx. One order of magnitude lower than in the organic layer. Dynamic changes of soil NO concentrations were closely correlated with soil surface NO fluxes. Differences in soil NO concentrations across the soil profile reflected differences in aerobic and anaerobic NO production potential. Conclusion The importance of such high NO concentrations for soil microbial and plant physiological processes remains unclear, but should be addressed in future research in order to improve our understanding of microbe-microbe and plant-microbe interactions.

AB Reactive nitrogen species have a strong influence on atmospheric chemistry and climate, tightly coupling the Earth's nitrogen cycle with microbial activity in the biosphere. Their sources, however, are not well constrained, especially in dryland regions accounting for a major fraction of the global land surface. Here, we show that biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are emitters of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO). Largest fluxes are obtained by dark cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts, being similar to 20 times higher than those of neighboring uncrusted soils. Based on laboratory, field, and satellite measurement data, we obtain a best estimate of similar to 1.7 Tg per year for the global emission of reactive nitrogen from biocrusts (1.1 Tg a(-1) of NO-N and 0.6 Tg a(-1) of HONO-N), corresponding to similar to 20% of global nitrogen oxide emissions from soils under natural vegetation. On continental scales, emissions are highest in Africa and South America and lowest in Europe. Our results suggest that dryland emissions of reactive nitrogen are largely driven by biocrusts rather than the underlying soil. They help to explain enigmatic discrepancies between measurement and modeling approaches of global reactive nitrogen emissions. As the emissions of biocrusts strongly depend on precipitation events, climate change affecting the distribution and frequency of precipitation may have a strong impact on terrestrial emissions of reactive nitrogen and related climate feedback effects. Because biocrusts also account for a large fraction of global terrestrial biological nitrogen fixation, their impacts should be further quantified and included in regional and global models of air chemistry, biogeochemistry, and climate.

AB A field experiment was conducted in a subtropical tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) plantation in Jiangsu Province, China, including the following treatments: no nitrogen (N) fertilizer (control), conventional mineral N fertilizer (urea) (CN), soybean cake fertilizer (SF), pig manure (PM), cattle manure (CaM), chicken manure (CM), and CM + biochar (CMB). Cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions were 4.8 +/- 0.1 and 3.7 +/- 0.3 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) under CN, respectively, and increased to 5.4 +/- 0.2 and 4.6 +/- 0.3 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) under SF (P < 0.05), respectively. Treatments with livestock manures (PM, CaM, and CM) reduced N2O (41.4-49.6%) and NO (46.5-59.8%) emission in comparison to CN. Combined amendment of CM and biochar more effectively reduced N2O emissions than CM treatment alone. Based on a meta-analysis of 26 global paired measurements in acid soils, the threshold of C/N ratios of organic fertilizers between the positive and negative responses of N2O emissions to organic fertilizers was 8.6 with a range of 4.5-22.3 (95% confidence interval), indicating that reduced N2O emission under PM, CaM and CM was potentially due to their C/N ratios compared to the threshold. Organic fertilizer application did not influence tea yield, while combined application of CM and biochar increased tea yield and resulted in the least yield-scaled N2O emission. N2O and NO emission factors for N fertilizers applied under CN were 1.9 +/- 0.1% and 1.5 +/- 0.2%, respectively, and reduced to 0.08 +/- 0.04% and 0.12 +/- 0.04% under CMB, respectively. The results suggest that tea plantations in the subtropical region are hotspots for N2O and NO emissions. Combined application of chicken manure and biochar could mitigate N gas emissions and increase yield in the tea plantation systems.

AB We explored whether the invasion of an exotic, nitrogen (N) fixing tree into native Hawaiian tropical forests has altered regional emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), two atmospherically important trace gases produced by microorganisms in soils. Ecosystem processes, including nitrification and N-oxide emissions, were not affected by Morella faya (formerly Myrica faya) invasion until it dominated the community with few native species in the overstory or understory. Remote-sensing estimates of upper-canopy leaf N concentration were strongly correlated to N-oxide emissions in ecosystems at the mesic-wet end of a precipitation gradient, where temperatures are warm, relatively constant, and N limits biological processes. In contrast, remotely sensed and field-based canopy chemistry was not related to N-oxide emissions in dry forest ecosystems where the seasonality of temperature and moisture exerted stronger control over soil gas fluxes. Thus, remote sensing of canopy N was useful for estimating the impact of M. faya on regional N-oxide emissions only in regions receiving > 1800 mm rainfall annually. Our estimates of N-oxide emissions from M. faya are half as large and 35 times more precise than those made using traditional, plot-level methods of extrapolation. Over the 40 years since its first occurrence in wet forests of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, M. faya has increased N-oxide emissions 16-fold, with its effects most pronounced in summer and at the N-rich centers of dense, monospecific stands.

AB Soil structure affects microbial activity and thus influences greenhouse gas production and exchange in soil. Structure is variable and increasingly vulnerable to compaction and erosion damage as agriculture intensifies and climate changes. Few studies have specifically related the impact of structure and its variability to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over a wide range of soils and management treatments. The objective of this study was to draw from research in Scotland, Japan and New Zealand, which examined how soil structures affected by wheel compaction, animal trampling, tillage and land-use change influence GHG emissions in order to help identify key controlling properties. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the main focus, though carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitric oxide (NO) are included. Gas emissions were measured by using static chambers in the field or incubated intact cores. Poor structure, measured as small relative gas diffusivities and air permeabilities, restricted aeration, resulting in N2O emission or consumption dependent on mineral nitrogen contents. Structural damage (identifiable using the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure) was especially important near the soil surface where microsites of microbial activity were exposed and aeration was impaired. Moist, well-aerated soils favoured CH4 oxidation and CO2 exchange. N2O emissions were not necessarily increased in anaerobic soils because of possible N2O consumption and microbial adaptation. Soil matric potential, volumetric water content, relative diffusivity, air permeability and water-filled pore space are relevant indicators for N2O and CH4 flux and aeration status. As pore continuity and size are so relevant, pore-scale models are likely to have an increasing role in understanding mechanisms of GHG production, transport and release.

AB At sites in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Rica, clearing and burning of a secondary tropical rain forest caused a significant increase in soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Soil-atmosphere NO fluxes averaged 0.5 ng N cm(-2) hr(-1) prior to clearing and increased to 4.1 ng N cm(-2) hr(-1) following clearing and to greater than 12.0 ng N cm(-2) hr(-1) following burning. Soil NO emissions were elevated for a period of 3-4 months following clearing, and fluxes peaked for 1-3 days following burning. We conducted a series of experiments with intact soil cores to determine the probable mechanism responsible for elevated NO emissions from soils. In one set of experiments we added substrates for microbial nitrification (ammonium), denitrification (nitrate), and chemical denitrification (nitrite) to autoclaved (killed) and nonautoclaved (live) soil cores. Water-only additions were used as controls. Compared to water or nitrate additions, ammonium caused a significant increase in NO emissions from live cores. Water, ammonium, and nitrate additions had no effect on emissions from autoclaved cores. Nitrite solution additions resulted in highly significant increases in NO emissions from both autoclaved and nonautoclaved soil cores. In a second set of experiments we treated intact soil cores with acetylene (1 kPa C2H2) to selectively inhibit nitrification and oxygen to inhibit denitrification. The oxygen treatment had no effect on NO production while acetylene significantly reduced NO emissions. The results from the substrate addition and inhibition experiments demonstrate that microbial denitrification is not a major pathway for NO production in these soils. In contrast, microbial nitrification appears to be a critical process responsible for NO emissions throughout the clearing and burning period. Field experiments with acetylene as an inhibitor show that immediately following burning, chemical denitrification of nitrite deposited in ash supports a large peak in NO fluxes.

AB Nitrous acid (HONO) greatly impacts tropospheric chemistry by producing hydroxyl radical (OH) through photolysis, and yet our knowledge about sources of HONO remains elusive. Emissions of nitrogen (N) containing gases from soils have long been a subject of research in biogeochemistry. Soil emissions of HONO have received greater attention recently, helping explain a missing source of observed atmospheric HONO. We conducted laboratory experiments to simultaneously measure emission fluxes of HONO along with other N containing gases including nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia (NH3) from lateritic red soil samples, and evaluated the contributions of microbiological processes to HONO emissions by conducting process inhibiting experiments. Results from monitoring emissions during a full wet-drying cycle showed that the emissions of HONO, NO and N2O have a strong dependance on soil water content, with maximum fluxes for HONO (125 +/- 17 ng N m(-2) s(-1)), NO (115 +/- 11 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) and N2O (453 +/- 100 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) observed at 17 % (HONO), 42 % (NO) and 94 % (N2O) water filled pore space (WFPS), respectively, while NH3 emission remains at similar to 16 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in majority of the WFPS range. Results from process inhibiting experiments suggested ammonia oxidation to be the dominant pathway for HONO production in the low water-content range, while reduction of nitrate to NO2- appeared dominant in the high water-content range. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of studying emissions of HONO along with other N containing gases as connected network of processes as a whole.

AB In seasonally dry ecosystems, which are common in sub-Saharan Africa, precipitation after dry periods can cause large pulses of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas, and of nitric oxide (NO), a precursor to tropospheric ozone pollution. Agricultural practices can change soil characteristics, affecting trace N gas emissions. To evaluate the effects of land use on trace gas pulses at the start of the rainy season, we conducted laboratory measurements of N2O and NO fluxes from soils collected from four pairs of agricultural and natural savannah sites across the Sudano-Sahelian zone. We also conducted in situ wetting experiments, measuring NO fluxes from fallow sandy soils in Tanzania and NO and N2O fluxes from clayey soils in Kenya with different histories of fertilizer use. In incubation studies, NO increased by a factor of 7 to 25 following wetting, and N2O fluxes shifted from negative to positive; cumulative NO fluxes were an order of magnitude larger than cumulative N2O fluxes. In Kenya and Tanzania, NO increased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude after wetting, and N2O increased by a factor of roughly 5 to 10. Cumulative NO fluxes ranged from 87 to 115 g NO-N ha(-1) across both countries-a substantial proportion of annual emissions-compared to roughly 1 g N2O-N in Kenya. There were no effects of land use or fertilization history on the magnitude of NO or N2O pulses, though land use may have been confounded with differences in soil texture potentially limiting the ability to detect land use effects.
   Plain Language Summary In ecosystems with distinct rainy and dry seasons, the first rainfall events stimulate biological activity in soils, leading to pulsed emissions of two nitrogen-based gases from soils: nitric oxide (NO), which leads to ozone pollution, and nitrous oxide (N2O), a powerful greenhouse gas. In farms where little fertilizer is used, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, soil may become depleted of nitrogen, which could result in smaller pulses of these gases. We measured emissions of NO and N2O in the laboratory after experimentally wetting soils from natural savanna and farm sites across the Sudano-Sahelian zone. We also measured emissions of both gases at farms in Kenya and Tanzania. In both studies, emissions of NO increased by a roughly 7 to 100 times after wetting. In the field studies, total emissions during the pulses-which lasted less than a day-were equivalent to about 1/4 to 1/3 of the NO emitted during the first 2 months of the cropping season, when most of the annual NO emissions are expected to occur. Emissions of N2O also increased after wetting, but the increases were smaller. No differences in the size of the laboratory emission pulses were found between the farm and savanna soils.

AB Many forest ecosystems in the world are suffering from high load of nitrogen (N) deposition and acting as potential contributors to atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), which regulates the oxidative capacity of the troposphere. However, the observation of NO flux with traditional dynamic chamber method is laborious in the forest ecosystem, particularly when the electric power generation system is unavailable. In this work, a relative method based on Pick's law of diffusion was developed to measure NO fluxes from forest soils. This method describes the relationship between NO and other trace gases, such as N2O or CO2, concerning gas fluxes and gas concentration gradients between the uppermost soil layer and the atmosphere. This relative method can be expressed as two forms: based on the directly obtained soil gas and based on the equilibrium gas at soil water surface. To testify the applicability of this method, both laboratory and field experiments were conducted with soil from an N saturated subtropical forest in Southwestern China. The results demonstrate that the NO fluxes measured based on the later form agreed well with those observed by chamber method, with the deviation rates of around 9% and 30%, respectively. In conclusion, this relative method provides a sound methodological basis for interpreting NO flux variations in the field, especially in N -saturated forest ecosystems, and allows an improvement of statistical N-budget in the world.

AB In the period 18-21 September 1989, soil NO emission was studied at Halvergate Marshes, Norfolk (U.K.) within the framework of the BIATEX-LOVENOX joint field experiment. Using a dynamic chamber technique, 186 measurements at four plots were performed showing a net NO flux of 7.2-14.6 x 10(-12) kgN m(-2) s(-1). Soil samples from a soil profile (1.0 m) at a representative site and from the uppermost layer (0.1 m) of each of the four plots were sent to the laboratory for (a) detailed physical and chemical soil analysis, (b) determination of NO production rates, NO uptake rate constants, and NO compensation mixing ratios, and (c) characterization of the microbial processes involved. A diffusive model (Galbally and Johansson, 1989) was applied to the laboratory results to infer NO fluxes of the individual soil samples. When we compared these fluxes with those measured in the field, we found agreement within a factor 2-4. Furthermore, laboratory studies showed, that NO was produced and consumed only in the upper soil layer (0-0.1 m depth) and that the NO production and consumption activities observed in the Halvergate marsh soil were most probably due to the anaerobic metabolism of denitrifying bacteria operating in anaerobic microniches within the generally aerobic soil.

AB The development of process-based models describing N oxide trace gas emissions from agricultural soils will assist in the assessment of present sources, prediction of future trends, and development of mitigation strategies. We compare the predictions of a transport and transformation model with data from intact soil core experiments and then use the model to evaluate the relative importance of individual processes after application of anhydrous ammonia to moderately acidic soil. Soil-gas concentrations of NO and N2O are adequately described using previously obtained kinetic expressions. Net NO surface fluxes are shown to be the result of high rates of subsurface gross NO production (>100 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) balanced by gross consumption rates equivalent to 92-97% of gross production. The overall temperature dependency of NO emissions is described adequately as the net result of individual temperature-dependent processes. Denitrification was estimated to contribute only 8-14% of the total N2O source under primarily aerobic conditions, with the balance caused by abiotic nitrous acid decomposition. The bulk soil reactivity of NO2 was estimated to be at least 500 times greater than the reactivity of NO. The potential for nonbiological nitrate formation is examined, and the effectiveness of pH control and subsurface fertilizer injection for minimizing gas losses are evaluated.

AB The objectives of the study were to quantify N2O and NO emissions from poultry litter and urea applications to Bermuda grass (Cynodaon dactylon L.) and examine the seasonal variations in emissions. Soil N2O and NO emissions were measured in a Bermuda grass pasture treated with two sources of poultry litter, composted poultry litter (CPL) and fresh poultry litter (FPL) and urea (URE). Nitrogen (N) was applied to supply 336 kg available N ha(-1) in four split applications made during the period from April to August 1995. An automated closed chamber system was employed to monitor N2O and NO emissions. The seasonal N2O emission patterns were characterized by several peaks occurring in phase with intermittent rain events and increasing soil N and organic carbon (C) associated with fertilizer application. The cumulative N2O emissions over the season (May to mid September) from the various treatments were, 3.87 kg N ha(-1) from FPL, 2.96 kg N ha(-1) from URE, and 1.64 kg N ha(-1) from CPL. These seasonal N2O losses accounted for 1.0, 0.73 and 0.32% of the added available N for the, FPL, URE and CPL treatments, respectively. Denitrification was suggested as the primary source of N2O following rain events when inorganic N and C soil concentrations were highest and soil water-filled-pore-space (WFPS) was elevated. Peaks in NO emissions were observed primarily immediately after the addition of N sources. The seasonal NO emissions were smaller and ranged from 1.36 kg N ha(-1) for URE, and 0.97 kg N ha(-1) for FPL, to 0.47 kg N ha(-1) for CPL. The seasonal NO emissions accounted for 0.36, 0.24 and 0.09% of the added N for the URE, FPL, and CPL treatments, respectively. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Accurate quantification of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions can establish a scientific foundation for developing targeted strategies to mitigate emissions, thereby reducing their environmental impact. Using a database with 476 field measurements across China, a NO emission model was constructed by employing four machine learning algorithms including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Our validation with independent observational data revealed that the XGBoost model performed the best, achieving a R2 of 0.67. The most important management, soil, and meteorological variables affecting the NO model were mineral nitrogen input, soil organic carbon content, and air temperature, respectively. This study also found that NO emissions exhibited nonlinear responses to different variables. NO emissions from China's farmland were estimated to be approximately 204.48 kt NO-N in 2020. By 2050, we predicted that NO emissions could increase by 2.9%-9.9% under various climate change scenarios, with the highest increment of 9.9% occurring under the RCP8.5 scenario. The southern agricultural region, which was particularly vulnerable to climate change, experienced the largest increase, ranging from approximately 15%-31%. The implementation of nitrogen management strategies that are adapted to future climate conditions could potentially reduce NO emissions by 15%-16.2%.

AB Biochar application to soil has been proposed as a promising tool for sequestering carbon, ensuring food security, mitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs), and lowering nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Efforts and observations to determine whether biochar can be repeatedly amended to soil to further sequester carbon while meeting those targets from long term and practical perspective are limited. A three-year field experiment was conducted to observe simultaneous methane (CH4), N2O, and NO emissions in a rice-wheat rotation system, where six treatments were established as follows: control plot without biochar (B0), biochar-enriched soil with biochar applied once in 2012 at 20 t ha-1 (B20-) and 40 t ha-1 (B40-), reapplication of half rate biochar in 2015 at 10 t ha-1 (B20+) and 20 t ha-1 (B40+) to the above described biochar-enriched soils, single application of biochar in 2015 to the control soil at 40 t ha-1 (B40). Then a series of incubation experiments explored the mechanism for mitigating trace gases. The results showed that compared with nonamended soils, the soils with the single biochar application and the biochar reapplication had similar effects on CH4, N2O, and NO emissions, significantly decreasing them by 14.5%-27.1%, 31.5%-43.4%, and 22.4%-33.6%, respectively, when compared with non-amended soils. The decrease in CH4 emissions was largely due to the decrease in CH4 production and the increase in CH4 oxidation in the biochar application treatments. Biochar single and reapplication significantly decreased yield-scaled GHGs by an average of 31.5% and yield-scaled N-oxides by an average of 41.0%. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of biochar in decreasing yield-scaled GHGs and yield-scaled N-oxides did not increase with the biochar reapplication at the two different application rates. Both single and reapplied biochar appeared to be promising practices to mitigate GHG and N-oxide emissions from the rice-wheat rotation system. Biochar can be repeatedly applied for further carbon sequestration while not hindering improvements in crop yield or mitigation of other GHGs and N-oxides.

AB Numerous papers on nitric oxide have been published covering various aspects ranging from its solution and gas-phase chemistry, biochemical and physiological functions and atmospheric processes. This review emphasizes recent developments in the literature relating to NO/NOx production in agricultural soils. We have tried to minimize overlap with other recent and relevant review articles. Emission measurements that have been made since 1992 are tabulated and discussed in terms of variability, fertilization effects, and advances made in monitoring fluxes. We describe attempts made by a number of authors to utilize ecological markers such as aeration, water, ammonium, nitrate content, etc. in order to distinguish between nitrification and denitrification as the primary source of production and/or consumption in natural field situations. This may allow a rational accounting for the high spatial and temporal variability observed, and the formulation of reliable predictive models. Factors such as diffusion, oxygen, water, and carbon (content and quality) that regulate or significantly influence production, consumption and emission are discussed. Finally some important implications of recent research relating to nitrification and denitrification is presented showing the chemical oxidation of NO which could occur when the acetylene inhibition technique is used.

AB The response of nitric oxide (NO) emissions to nitrogen (N) input in agricultural ecosystems is generally assumed to be linear, but the availability of inorganic soil N exceeding crop N demands may cause a threshold response of NO. We conducted a four-rotation field measurement with discrepant N fertilizer rates during the wheat season of the rice-wheat rotation in the Taihu Lake region in China to test the hypothesis. Across all years, a nonlinear model well characterized the response of cumulative NO emissions to N fertilizer rates. The direct emission factors of NO induced by fertilizer also increased nonlinearly with increasing N doses, with a mean of 1.06% (ranging from 0.54% to 1.49%). NO emissions were low (<1.81 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) over the 0-180 kg N ha(-1) fertilizer additions; above these additions, the increasing N rates resulted in substantial NO increases ranging from 73% to 245% but only elevated crop yields by 6%. The results suggested defining the N rate of 180 kg N ha(-1) as a promising level for achieving decreased NO emissions without greatly affecting the economic return from grain yield.

AB Independent soil microcosm experiments were used to investigate the effects of the fungicides mancozeb and chlorothalonil, and the herbicide prosulfuron, on N2O and NO production by nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in fertilized soil. Soil cores were amended with NH4NO3 or NH4NO3 and pesticide, and the N2O and NO concentrations were monitored periodically for approximately 48 It following amendment. Nitrification is the major source of N2O and NO in these soils at soil moistures relevant to those observed at the field site where the cores were collected. At pesticide concentrations from 0.02 to 10 times that of a standard single application on a corn crop, N2O and NO production was inhibited by all three pesticides. Generally N2O production was inhibited by the pesticides from 10 to 62% and 20 to 98% at the lowest and highest dosages, respectively. Nitric oxide production was generally inhibited from about 5 to 47% and by 20 to 97% at the lowest and highest dosages, respectively. Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide production by nitrification was more susceptible to inhibition by these pesticides than denitrification. Production of both N2O and NO by nitrification was inhibited by as much as 99%, at the highest concentration of pesticide applied. The net production of N2O increased as soil moisture increased. The rate of NO production was greatest at the intermediate moistures investigated, between 14 and 19% gravimetric soil moisture, suggestive that nitrification is the dominant source of NO.

AB Emission of nitric oxide (NO) from a variety of plant species was observed in a continuously stirred tank reactor. During daytime and at NO concentrations below 1 ppb in the chamber air, NO emissions were observed for all studied nitrate-nourished plant species. A relation was found between the NO emission rates during daytime and the uptake rates of CO2. The ratio of the NO emission rate to the CO2 uptake was similar for all plants. Changes of the net rate of photosynthesis induced by variations of light intensity or changes of CO2 concentrations changed the NO emission rates correspondingly. The link between NO emissions and CO2 uptake during daytime allowed estimation of the potential of the vegetation to evolve NO on a global scale as 0.23 Tg N yr(-1). Strong NO emissions during nights were observed when the nitrate concentration in the nutrient solution was enhanced. Then NO emissions were observed with flux densities comparable to the highest emission rates found from soils.

AB Several studies have shown that the use of nitrogen fertilizers increases the emission of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from agricultural soils. Nitrous acid (HONO) is another form of gaseous N which increase the reactivity potential in the atmosphere by forming OH radicals in photolysis and further oxidize pollutants e.g. methane. It has recently been discovered that soil is a source of HONO. In our experiment with grassland (Phleum pratense L.), we found that HONO emissions increased up to 14 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) in the plot receiving annually 450 kg N ha(-1) and were strongly linked with soil nitrite (NO2-) concentration and pH. A strong correlation between HONO and NO emissions was also observed. This finding suggests that agricultural soils could be an important source of HONO and its emission is primarily dependent soil NO2- concentration. Moreover, in agricultural soils the production pathway of HONO and NO could be similar and more studies on the effect of fertilization on HONO emission are needed.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the effect of soil water content, and other physical and chemical factors, on the abiotic component of nitric oxide (NO) production in laboratory studies using soils from agricultural fields in Minnesota, California, and Connecticut. In all soils, gross NO production decreased with increasing gravimetric water content (theta) in nitrite (NO2-)-amended sterilized soils. The rate coefficient describing nitrous acid (HNO2)-mediated NO production (k(p)) also decreased with increasing theta in both gamma-irradiated and autoclaved soils. Significant correlations were found between ln k(p) and several soil properties including: content of silt, clay, total carbon, total N, and extractable iron, and an estimate of the cation exchange capacity of the clay fraction. Multiple regression models incorporating these variables explained 85-93% of the variance in ln k(p). The relationships obtained suggest that the mechanism of abiotic NO production is primarily mediated at the soil solution-surface interface. These findings provide consistent evidence of a previously unrecognized mechanism by which soil water content can affect NO production by mediating a chemical process. Application of a dynamic process model indicated that the simulated variation in NO emissions as a consequence of this effect is comparable to the variation observed in previous studies of NO emissions. Comparison of soils from two different long-term tillage studies also indicated that reduced pH in no-till systems may lead to greater NO emissions for a given level of NO2- accumulation. Overall, these results suggest that current views of controls over N oxide gas emissions may need to be revised to include abiotic reactions, in addition to microbial and physical processes, as yet another category of factors that is highly sensitive to soil water content.

AB From spring 2000 through fall 2001, we measured nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in two temperate forest sites in Massachusetts, USA that have been treated since 1988 with different levels of nitrogen (N) to simulate elevated rates of atmospheric N deposition. Plots within a pine stand that were treated with either 50 or 150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) above background displayed consistently elevated NO fluxes (100-200 mug N m(-2) h(-1)) compared to control plots, while only the higher N treatment plot within a mixed hardwood stand displayed similarly elevated NO fluxes. Annual NO emissions estimated from monthly sampling accounted for 3.0-3.7% of N inputs to the high-N plots and 8.3% of inputs to the Pine low-N plot. Nitrous oxide fluxes in the N-treated plots were generally < 10% of NO fluxes. Net nitrification rates (NRs) and NO production rates measured in the laboratory displayed patterns that were consistent with field NO fluxes. Total N oxide gas flux was positively correlated with contemporaneous measurements of NR and NO3- concentration. Acetylene inhibited both nitrification and NO production, indicating that autotrophic nitrification was responsible for the elevated NO production. Soil pH was negatively correlated with N deposition rate. Low levels (3-11 mug N kg(-1)) of nitrite (NO2-) were detected in mineral soils from both sites. Kinetic models describing NO production as a function of the protonated form of NO2- (nitrous acid [HNO2]) adequately described the mineral soil data. The results indicate that atmospheric deposition may generate losses of gaseous NO from forest soils by promoting nitrification, and that the response may vary significantly between forest types under similar climatic regimes. The lowering of pH resulting from nitrification and/or directly from deposition may also play a role by promoting reactions involving HNO2 .

AB Residual effects of different fertilizers (mineral and organic) on the first pulses of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O) after rewetting dry soil with or without application of a mineral N fertilizer were studied in a laboratory experiment. Six months before this study was conducted the fields had received either manure + urea, manure, urea or no fertilizer. In the first phase the soil was rewetted with water simulating a summer shower (heavy rainfall in short time) and in the second phase with a urea solution simulating a mineral fertilization. There were not significant differences in trace gas emissions between earlier field treatments after soil was rewetted with water addition. However, after urea addition, plots that had received manure 6 months earlier showed smaller total emissions of N2O and NO compared to plots that had only received urea. The residual effect of manure can play an important role in carbon poor soils under arid-semiarid climate in mitigating atmospheric pollutants such us NO and N2O.

AB Intertidal wetland sediments are an important source of atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx), but their contribution to the global NOx budget remains unclear. In this work, we conducted year-round and diurnal observations in the intertidal wetland of Jiaozhou Bay to explore their regional source-sink patterns and influence factors on NOx emissions (initially in the form of nitric oxide) and used a dynamic soil reactor to further extend the mechanisms underlying the tidal pulse of nitric oxide (NO) observed in our investigations. The annual fluxes of NOx in the vegetated wetland were significantly higher than those in the wetland without vegetation. Their annual variations could be attributed to changes in temperature and the amount of organic carbon in the sediment, which was derived from vegetated plants and promoted the carbon-nitrogen cycle. Anaerobic denitrifiers had advantages in the intertidal wetland sediment and accounted for the major NO production (63.8 %) but were still limited by nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the sediment. Moreover, the tidal pulse was likely a primary driver of NOx emissions from intertidal wetlands over short periods, which was not considered in previous investigations. The annual NO exchange flux considering the tide pulse contribution (8.93 +/- 1.72 x 10-2 kg N ha-1 yr-1) was significantly higher than that of the non-pulse period (4.14 +/- 1.13 x 10-2 kg N ha-1 yr-1) in our modeling result for the fluxes over the last decade. Therefore, the current measurement of NOx fluxes underestimated the actual gas emission without considering the tidal pulse.

AB Soils are an important source of NO, particularly in dry lands because of trade-offs that develop between biotic and abiotic NO-producing processes when soils dry out. Understanding how drier climates may offset the balance of these trade-offs as soils transition toward more arid states is, therefore, critical to estimating global NO budgets, especially because drylands are expected to increase in size. We measured NO emission pulses after wetting soils from similar lithologies along an altitudinal gradient in the Sierra Nevada, CA, where mean annual precipitation varied from 670 to 1500 mm. Along the gradient, we measured field NO emissions, and used chloroform in the laboratory to reduce microbial activity and partition between biotic and abiotic NO-producing processes (i.e., chemodenitrification). Field NO emission pulses were lowest in the acidic and SOM-rich soils (4-72 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1)), but were highest in the high-elevation barren site (similar to 560 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1)). In the laboratory, NO emission pulses were up to 199 greater in chloroform-treated soils than in the controls, and these abiotic pulses increased with elevation as pH decreased (6.2-4.4) and soil organic matter (SOM) increased (18-157 mg C g(-1)). Drought can shift the balance between the biotic and abiotic processes that produce NO, favoring chemodenitrification during periods when biological processes become stressed. Acidic and SOM-rich soils, which typically develop under mesic conditions, are most vulnerable to N loss via NO as interactions between pH, SOM, and drought stimulate chemodenitrification.

AB Nitrogen (N) enrichment of tropical ecosystems is likely to increase with rapid industrial and agricultural development, but the ecological consequences of N additions in these systems are not well understood. We measured soil N-oxide emissions and N transformations in primary rain forest ecosystems at four elevations and across two substrate types on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo, before and after short-term experimental N additions. We also measured N pools and fluxes across a land use gradient of primary forest, burned secondary forest, and fertilized agriculture. Background soil N2O and NO emissions in primary forest decreased with elevation, and soils derived from sedimentary substrates had larger pools of inorganic N, rates of nitrification, and N-oxide fluxes than ultrabasic soils when there were significant differences between substrate types. N-oxide emissions after N additions and background rates of nitrification were low in all soils derived from ultrabasic substrates compared to sedimentary substrates, even at lowland sites supporting, diverse Dipterocarp forests growing on morphologically similar Oxisols. Rates of potential nitrification were good predictors of N-oxide emissions after N additions. N2O and NO fluxes were largest at low elevations and on sedimentary-derived soils compared to ultrabasic-derived soils, even at the smallest addition of N, 15 kgN ha(-1). Because current methods of soil classification do not explicitly characterize a number of soil chemical properties important to nutrient cycling, the use of soil maps to extrapolate biogeochemical processes to the region or globe may be limited in its accuracy and usefulness. In agricultural systems, management practices were more important than substratetype in controlling N-oxidee missions and soil N cycling. N-oxide fluxes from agricultural fields were more than an order of magnitude greater than from primary forests on the same substrate type and at the same elevation. As primary forests are cleared for intensive agriculture, soil N2O and NO emissions are likely to far exceed those from the most N-saturated tropical forest ecosystems. This study highlights the inter-dependence of climate, substrate age, N deposition, and land-use practices determining N cycling and N-oxide emissions in humid tropical regions.

AB Several gases are either produced or consumed by biological and chemical transformations of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soils. Some of these gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, play a role in the earth's radiation balance (greenhouse effect) while others, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides (NOx, i.e., NO and NO2), have negative impacts on atmospheric chemistry. In this entry, we briefly describe how C and N gases are produced or consumed in soils and how soil management and soil quality can affect these processes.

AB Cotton is one of the major crops worldwide and delivers fibers to textile industries across the globe. Its cultivation requires high nitrogen (N) input and additionally irrigation, and the combination of both has the potential to trigger high emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), thereby contributing to rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using an automated static chamber measuring system, we monitored in high temporal resolution N2O and NO fluxes in an irrigated cotton field in Northern China, between January 1st and December 31st 2008. Mean daily fluxes varied between 5.8 to 373.0 A mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and -3.7 to 135.7 A mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1), corresponding to an annual emission of 2.6 and 0.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively. The highest emissions of both gases were observed directly after the N fertilization and lasted approximately 1 month. During this time period, the emission was 0.85 and 0.22 kg N ha(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively, and was responsible for 32.3% and 29.0% of the annual total N2O and NO loss. Soil temperature, moisture and mineral N content significantly affected the emissions of both gases (p < 0.01). Direct emission factors were estimated to be 0.95% (N2O) and 0.24% (NO). We also analyzed the effects of sampling time and frequency on the estimations of annual cumulative N2O and NO emissions and found that low frequency measurements produced annual estimates which differed widely from those that were based on continuous measurements.

AB Soil NOx emission from agricultural regions in the western United States has been investigated using satellite observations of NO2 from the SCIAMACHY instrument. We show that the SCIAMACHY observations over a 2 million hectare agricultural region in Montana capture the short intense NOx pulses following fertilizer application and subsequent precipitation and we demonstrate that these variations can be reproduced by tuning the mechanistic parameters in an existing model of soil NOx emissions.

DT Article
ID OXYGEN-UPTAKE; INHIBITORS
AB A Silty loam soil treated with 1-allyl-2-thiourea;Is an inhibitor of autotrophic nitrification, and sulfide as an inhibitor of nitric oxide reductase in respiratory denitrification, was studied to evaluate the respective contribution of these two microbial processes to the nitric oxide (NO) flux from the soil. Soil samples were either unamended or amended with ammoniated fertilizer or biosolids from a wastewater treatment plant at an application rate of 100 lb-nitrogen/acre. Water-filled pore space and temperature were maintained within respective ranges of 22 +/- 2% and 22 +/- 1 degreesC. NO fluxes from unamended, chemically fertilized, and biosolids-amended soil samples increase in that order, and autotrophic nitrification accounts for 80, 84, and 92% of the NO flux, respectively. The suggested Jousset-Peirce index Psi, which shows the contribution of respiratory denitrification with respect to heterotrophic nitrification and chemodenitrification, decreases by a factor of 3.3 and 5.6 from unamended to chemically fertilized soil samples and from unamended to biosolids-amended soil samples, respectively. An ancillary finding reveals the dramatic sensitivity of denitrification to the presence of sulfide.

ID UNITED-STATES
AB Utilizing a state-of-the-art mobile laboratory in conjunction with a dynamic flow-through chamber system, nitric oxide concentrations [NO] were measured and NO fluxes were calculated during the summer, winter and spring of 1999/ 2000. The field site where these measurements were conducted was an agricultural soil amended with biosolids from a municipal wastewater treatment facility. These NO flux values were then used to assess the impact of including biosolid amended soils as a land-use class in an air quality model. The average NO flux from this biosolid amended soil was found to be exponentially dependent on soil temperature [NO Flux (ng N m(-2) s(-1)) = 1.07 exp(0.14 T-soil); R-2 = 0.81-NO Flux = 71.3 ng N m(-2) s(-1) at 30degreesC]. Comparing this relationship to results of the widely applied biogenic emissions inventory system (BEIS2) model revealed that for this field site, if the BEIS2 model was used, the NO emissions would have been underestimated by a factor of 26. Using this newly developed NO flux algorithm, combined with North Carolina Division of Water Quality statistics on how many biosolid amended acres are permitted per county, county-based NO inventories from these biosolid amended soils were calculated. Results from this study indicate that county-level biogenic NO emissions can increase by as much as 18% when biosolid amended soils are included as a land-use class. The multiscale air quality simulation platform (MAQSIP) was then used to determine differences in ozone (O-3) and odd-reactive nitrogen compounds (NO,) between models run with and without the biosolid amended acreages included in the inventory. Results showed that during the daytime, when atmospheric mixing heights are typically at their greatest, any increase in O-3 or NOy concentrations predicted by the model were small (< 3%). In some locations during late evening/early morning hours, ozone was found to be consumed by as much as 11%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrous oxide, nitric oxide and denitrification losses from an irrigated soil amended with organic fertilizers with different soluble organic carbon fractions and ammonium contents were studied in a field study covering the growing season of potato (Solanum tuberosum). Untreated pig slurry (IPS) with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD), digested thin fraction of pig slurry (DTP), composted solid fraction of pig slurry (CP) and composted municipal solid waste (MSW) mixed with urea were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N ha(-1), and emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment without any added N fertilizer (Control). The cumulative denitrification losses correlated significantly with the soluble carbohydrates, dissolved N and total C added. Added dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved N affected the N2O/N-2 ratio, and a lower ratio was observed for organic fertilizers than from urea or unfertilized controls. The proportion of N2O produced from nitrification was higher from urea than from organic fertilizers. Accumulated N2O losses during the crop season ranged from 3.69 to 7.31 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for control and urea, respectively, whereas NO losses ranged from 0.005 to 0.24 kg NO-N ha(-1), respectively. Digested thin fraction of pig slurry compared to IPS mitigated the total N2O emission by 48% and the denitrification rate by 33%, but did not influence NO emissions. Composted pig slurry compared to untreated pig slurry increased the N2O emission by 40% and NO emission by 55%, but reduced the denitrification losses (34%). DCD partially inhibited nitrification rates and reduced N2O and NO emissions from pig slurry by at least 83% and 77%, respectively. MSW+U, with a C:N ratio higher than that of the composted pig slurry, produced the largest denitrification losses (33.3 kg N ha(-1)), although N2O and NO emissions were lower than for the U and CP treatments.
   This work has shown that for an irrigated clay loam soil additions of treated organic fertilizers can mitigate the emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and N2O in comparison with urea. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of changes in tropical land use on soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and nitric oxide (NO) are not well understood. We examined emissions of N(2)O and NO and their relationships to land use and forest composition, litterfall, soil nitrogen (N) pools and turnover, soil moisture, and patterns of carbon (C) cycling in a lower montane, subtropical wet region of Puerto Rico. Fluxes of N(2)O and NO were measured monthly for over 1 year in old (more than 60 years old) pastures, early- and mid-successional forests previously in pasture, and late-successional forests not known to have been in pasture within the tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa) forest zone. Additional, though less frequent, measures were also made in an experimentally fertilized tabonuco forest. N(2)O fluxes exceeded NO fluxes at all sites, reflecting the consistently wet environment. The fertilized forest had the highest N oxide emissions (22.0 kg . N . ha(-1) . y(-1)). Among the unfertilized sites, the expected pattern of increasing emissions with stand age did not occur in all cases. The mid-successional forest most dominated by leguminous trees had the highest emissions (9.0 kg N . ha(-1) . y(-1)), whereas the mid-successional forest lacking legumes had the lowest emissions (0.09 kg N . ha(-1) . y(-1)). N oxide fluxes from late-successional forests were higher than fluxes from pastures. Annual N oxide fluxes correlated positively to leaf litter N, net nitrification potential nitrification, soil nitrate, and net N mineralization and negatively to leaf litter C:N ratio. Soil ammonium was not related to N oxide emissions. Forests with lower fluxes of N oxides had higher rates of C mineralization than sites with higher N oxide emissions. We conclude that (a) N oxide fluxes were substantial where the availability of inorganic N exceeded the requirements of competing biota; (b) species composition resulting from historical land use or varying successional dynamics played an important role in determining N availability; and (c) the established ecosystem models that predict N oxide loss from positive relationships with soil ammonium may need to be modified.

AB Overuse of agrochemicals is linked to nutrient loss, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, and resource depletion thus requiring the development of sustainable agricultural solutions. Cultivated microalgal biomass could provide such a solution. The environmental consequences of algal biomass application in agriculture and more specifically its effect on soil GHG emissions are understudied. Here we report the results of a field experiment of wheat grown on three different soil types under the same climatic conditions and fertilized by urea or the untreated biomass of fresh-water green microalga (Coelastrella sp.). The results show that neither soil type nor fertilization types impacted the aboveground wheat biomass, whereas, soil microbiomes differed in accordance with soil but not the fertilizer type. However, wheat grain nitrogen (N) content and soil N oxides emissions were significantly lower in plots fertilized by algal biomass compared to urea. Grain N content in the wheat grain that was fertilized by algal biomass was between 1.3%-1.5% vs. 1.6%-2.0% in the urea fertilized wheat. Cumulative soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions were 2-5 fold lower, 313-726 g N ha-1 season-1 vs. 909-3079 g N ha-1 season-1. Cumulative soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 2-fold lower, 90-348 g N ha-1 season-1 vs. 147-761 g N ha-1 season-1. The lower emissions resulted in a 4-11 fold lower global warming impact of the algal fertilized crops. This calculation excluded the CO2 cost from the algae biomass production. Once included algal fertilization had a similar, or 40% higher, climatic impact compared to the urea fertilization. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Formation of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide in water treatment systems is predominantly studied as a biological phenomenon. There are indications that also chemical processes contribute to these emissions. Here we studied the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) due to chemical nitrite reduction by ferrous iron (Fe(II)). Reduction of nitrite and NO coupled to Fe(II) oxidation was studied in laboratory-scale chemical experiments at different pH, nitrite and iron concentrations. The continuous measurement of both NO and N(2)O emission showed that nitrite reduction and NO reduction have different kinetics. Nitrite reduction shows a linear dependency on the nitrite concentration, implying first order kinetics in nitrite. The nitrite reduction seems to be an equilibrium based reaction, leading to a constant NO concentration in the liquid. The NO reduction rate is suggested to be most dependent on reactive surface availability and the sorption of Fe(II) to the reactive surface. The importance of emission of NO and N(2)O coupled to iron oxidation is exemplified by iron reduction experiments and several examples of environments where this pathway can play a role.

AB Changes in precipitation in the Amazon Basin resulting from regional deforestation, global warming, and El Nino events may affect emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) from soils. Changes in soil emissions of radiatively important gases could have feedback implications for regional and global climate. Here, we report the final results of a 5-year, large-scale (1 ha) throughfall exclusion experiment, followed by 1 year of recovery with natural throughfall, conducted in a mature evergreen forest near Santarem, Brazil. The exclusion manipulation lowered annual N2O emissions in four out of five treatment years (a natural drought year being the exception), and then recovered during the first year after the drought treatment stopped. Similarly, consumption of atmospheric CH4 increased under drought treatment, except during a natural drought year, and it also recovered to pretreatment values during the first year that natural throughfall was permitted back on the plot. No treatment effect was detected for NO emissions during the first 3 treatment years, but NO emissions increased in the fourth year under the extremely dry conditions of the exclusion plot during a natural drought. Surprisingly, there was no treatment effect on soil CO2 efflux in any year. The drought treatment provoked significant tree mortality and reduced the allocation of C to stems, but allocation of C to foliage and roots were less affected. Taken together, these results suggest that the dominant effect of throughfall exclusion on soil processes during this 6-year period was on soil aeration conditions that transiently affected CH4, N2O, and NO production and consumption.

AB Agricultural activities have greatly altered the global nitrogen (N) cycle and produced nitrogenous gases of environmental significance. More than half of all chemical N fertilizer produced globally is used in crop production in East, Southeast and South Asia, where rice is central to nutrition. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) from croplands in this region were estimated by considering background emission and emissions resulting from N added to croplands, including chemical N, animal manure, biologically fixed N and N in crop residues returned to fields. Background emission fluxes of N2O and NO from croplands were estimated to be 1.22 and 0.57 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), respectively. Separate fertilizer-induced emission factors were estimated for upland fields and rice fields. Total N2O emission from croplands in the study region was estimated to be 1.19 Tg N yr(-1), with 43% contributed by background emissions. The average fertilizer-induced N2O emission, however, accounts for only 0.93% of the applied N, which is less than the default IPCC value of 1.25%, because of the low emission factor from paddy fields. Total NO emission was 591 Gg N yr(-1) in the study region, with 40% from background emissions. The average fertilizer-induced NO emission factor was 0.48%. Total NH3 emission was estimated to be 11.8 Tg N yr(-1). The use of urea and ammonium bicarbonate and the cultivation of rice led to a high average NH3 loss rate from chemical N fertilizer in the study region. Emissions were displayed at a 0.5degrees x 0.5degrees resolution with the use of a global landuse database.

AB Soils of arid and semi-arid ecosystems are important biogenic sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), however, there is still a shortage of measurements from these systems. Here we present the results of a laboratory study of the biogenic emission of NO from four different landscape positions of the Kruger National Park (KNP), a large conservation area in a semi-arid region of South Africa. Results show that the highest net potential NO fluxes come from the low lying (footslope) landscape regions, which have the largest nitrogen stocks and highest rates of nitrogen input into the soil. Net potential NO fluxes from midslope and crest regions were considerably lower. The maximum release of NO occurred at fairly low soil moisture contents of 10%-20% water filled pore space. Using soil moisture and temperature data obtained in situ at the Kruger National Park flux tower site, net potential NO fluxes obtained in the laboratory were converted to field fluxes for each of the four landscape positions for the period 2003 to 2005. The highest field NO flux is from footslope positions, during each of these years and emissions ranged from 1.5-8.5 kg ha a (in terms of mass of nitrogen). Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems techniques were used to up-scale field NO fluxes on a regional basis indicating that the highest emissions occurred from the midslope positions, due to their large geographical extent in the considered research area. Emissions for the KNP Skukuza land type (56 000 ha) ranged from 20 x 10(3) kg in 2004 to 34 x 10(3) kg in 2003. The importance of landscape characteristics in the determination of regional biogenic NO soil emission is emphasized.

AB NO emissions from soils and ecosystems are of outstanding importance for atmospheric chemistry. Here we review the current knowledge on processes involved in the formation and consumption of NO in soils, the importance of NO for the physiological functioning of different organisms, and for inter- and intra-species signaling and competition, e.g. in the rooting zone between microbes and plants. We also show that prokaryotes and eukaryotes are able to produce NO by multiple pathways and that unspecific enzymo-oxidative mechanisms of NO production are likely to occur in soils. Nitric oxide production in soils is not only linked to NO production by nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms, but also linked to extracellular enzymes from a wide range of microorganisms.
   Further investigations are needed to clarify molecular mechanisms of NO production and consumption, its controlling factors, and the significance of NO as a regulator for microbial, animal and plant processes. Such process understanding is required to elucidate the importance of soils as sources (and sinks) for atmospheric NO. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plastic-shed vegetable production in China creates hotspots for emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and the atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO). To mitigate N2O and NO emissions, determination of the predominant processes of N2O and NO generation in plastic-shed vegetable production is important. Here, we reported the findings of a 2-year experimental study on the effects of reduced fertilization and/or drip irrigation on N2O and NO emissions during plastic-shed tomato production in northern China. Five treatments were applied: 1) over fertilization and flood irrigation (conventional practice); 2) fertilization reduced by 20% and flood irrigation; 3) fertilization reduced by 20% and drip irrigation; 4) fertilization reduced by 30% and drip irrigation, and 5) control (no fertilizer input and flood irrigation). Reduced both basal and top-dressed fertilization maintained tomato yields. Compared with conventional practices (mean annual N2O and NO emissions: 18.1 +/- 1.3 and 0.79 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively), fertilization reduction by 20%-30% decreased the annual N2O emission by 21.2%-27.0% owing to lower soil inorganic nitrogen (SIN) contents under the reduced fertilization practices. Switching from flood to drip irrigation might weaken denitrification due to lower soil moisture and less wet soil area, but increased SINcontents, and thus had no significant impact on annual N2O and NO emissions. Peak N2O fluxes occurred at soil temperature 28 degrees C and waterfilled pore space (WFPS) > 60%, were higher than those for NO, and peak NO fluxes appeared 4-6 days later than N2O fluxes, consistent with the decline in WFPS. These observations indicated that N2O and NO from alkaline plastic-shed soil may bemainly generated via heterotrophic denitrification and nitrification, respectively. Reduced fertilization and drip irrigation in plastic-shed tomato production maintained crop productivity and mitigated N2O emission. These results could be integrated into the decision-making in sustainable plastic-shed production.

AB Tea fields represent an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions due to high nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications and very low soil pH. To investigate the temporal characteristics of N2O and NO emissions, daily emissions were measured over 2A 1/2 years period using static closed-chamber/gas chromatograph and chemiluminescent measurement system in a tea field of subtropical central China. Our results revealed that N2O and NO fluxes showed similar temporal trends, which were generally driven by temporal variations in soil temperature and soil moisture content and were also affected by fertilization events. The measured average annual N2O and NO emissions were 10.9 and 3.3 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, highlighting the high N2O and NO emissions from tea fields. To improve our understanding of N-cycling processes in tea ecosystems, we developed a new nitrogenous gas emission module for the water and nitrogen management model (WNMM, V2) that simulated daily N2O and NO fluxes, in which the NO was simulated as being emitted from both nitrification and nitrite chemical decomposition. The results demonstrated that the WNMM captured the general temporal dynamics of N2O (NSE = 0.40; R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 0.03 kg N ha(-1) day(-1), P < 0.001) and NO (NSE = 0.41; R-2 = 0.44, RMSE = 0.01 kg N ha(-1) day(-1), P < 0.001) emissions. According to the simulation, denitrification was identified as the dominant process contributing 76.5% of the total N2O emissions, while nitrification and nitrite chemical decomposition accounted for 52.3 and 47.7% of the total NO emissions, respectively.

AB The humid tropical zone is a major source area for N2O and NO emissions to the atmosphere. Local emission rates vary widely with local conditions, particularly land use practices which swiftly change with expanding settlement and changing market conditions. The combination of wide variation in emission rates and rapidly changing land use make regional estimation and future prediction of biogenic trace gas emission particularly difficult. This study estimates contemporary, historical, and future N2O and NO emissions from 0.5 million ha of northeastern Costa Rica, a well-documented region in the wet tropics undergoing rapid agricultural development. Estimates were derived by linking spatially distributed environmental data with an ecosystem simulation model in an ensemble estimation approach that incorporates the variance and covariance of spatially distributed driving variables. Results include measures of variance for regional emissions. The formation and aging of pastures from forest provided most of the past temporal change in N2O and NO flux in this region; future changes will be controlled by the degree of nitrogen fertilizer application and extent of intensively managed croplands.

AB Horse dung contains considerable amounts of nitrogen which is partly lost during the storage period. Leaching of nitrogen from the dung can be prevented with constructions but also gaseous N-emissions occur. However, the emission rates are not reported in the literature. We measured in laboratory conditions nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO) emissions from fresh, one month old and one year old horse dung samples. NO and HONO emissions increased with the storage time of the dung. The mean emission rates of HONO and NO were from 36 to 280 ng N kg dw(-1) h(-1) and from 15 to 3500 ng N kg dw(-1) h(-1), respectively. N2O emissions were more variable showing also highest emissions (20.3 mu g N kg dw(-1) h(-1)) from the oldest samples. Thus, the longer storage of horse dung increases gaseous N losses which should be taken into account when planning an environmental friendly way to handle horse dung.

AB Contradictory findings can be found in the literature regarding the effects of applying organic instead of mineral fertilizers on the associated emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). The main aim of this experiment was to study the effect on these emissions of applying mineral or organic fertilizers to a non-irrigated crop under Mediterranean conditions. A secondary aim was to determine whether application of the fertilizer had a residual effect on the N2O and NO pulses observed after the first rainfall events in autumn, and the magnitude of these fluxes. A field experiment was carried out with a barley crop (Hordeum vulgare L cv Bornova). Untreated pig slurry (UPS), digested pig slurry (DPS), municipal solid waste (MSW) and composted crop residues mixed with sewage sludge (CCR + S) were applied to the soil. The resulting emissions were compared with those from a mineral fertilizer, urea (U), and a control treatment (C), in which no nitrogen was applied. Very low NO and N2O fluxes were measured during the entire experimental period in all treatments. The accumulated N2O emissions from the organic and inorganic fertilizers ranged from 266 to 345 g N2O-N ha(-1) and did not show significant differences. Three of the four organic fertilizers had the positive effect of reducing NO emissions (28.82-44.48 g NO-N ha(-1)) compared with inorganic fertilizer (61.86 g NO-N ha(-1)). Nitrous oxide pulses were observed in autumn. Negative N2O fluxes were measured on several occasions. The emission factor relating N2O emissions to the N applied as fertilizer, ranged from 0.06 to 0.17% for MSW and DPS, respectively, which is much lower than the default factor proposed by the IPCC. The emission factor which relates N2O emissions to crop production ranged from 241 to 361 mg N2O-N kg(-1) for DPS and U, respectively, suggesting that DPS should be promoted in order to reduce N2O emissions.

AB We report on an ecosystem modeling approach that integrates global satellite, climate, vegetation, and soil data sets to (1) examine conceptual controls on nitrogen trace gas (NO, N2O, and N-2) emissions from soils and (2) identify weaknesses in our bases of knowledge and data for these fluxes. Nitrous and nitric oxide emissions from well-drained soils were estimated by using an expanded version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford (CASA) Biosphere model, a coupled ecosystem production and soil carbon-nitrogen model on a 1 degrees global grid. We estimate monthly production of NO, N2O, and N-2 based on predicted rates of gross N mineralization, together with an index of transient water-filled pore space in soils. Analyses of model performance along selected climate gradients support the hypothesis that low temperature restricts predicted N mineralization and trace gas emission rates in moist northern temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, whereas in tropical zones, seasonal patterns in N mineralization result in emission peaks for N2O that coincide with wetting and high soil moisture content. The model predicts the annual N2O:NO flux ratio at a mean value of 1.2 in wet tropical forests, decreasing to around 0.6 in the seasonally dry savannas. Global emission estimates at the soil surface are 6.1 Tg N and 9.7 Tg N yr(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively, Tropical dry forests and savannas are identified by using this formulation as important source areas for nitrogen trace gas emissions. Because humans continue to alter these ecosystems extensively for agricultural uses, our results suggest that more study is needed in seasonally dry ecosystems of the tropics in order to understand the global impacts of land use change on soil sources for N2O and NO.

AB Nitrogen (N) inputs and land-use conversion are management practices that affect soil greenhouse gas (GHG) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Here, we measured soil methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and NO fluxes from rice fields and a peach orchard that converted from paddies to assess the impacts of nitrogen (N) inputs and land-use conversion on their emissions. Treatments included four paddy field treatments (PN0, PN160, PN220, and PN280) and one peach orchard treatment (ON280) with number indicating the N-input rate of kg N ha(-1). The results showed that cumulative emissions of CH4, N2O and NO ranged from 28.6 to 85.3 kg C ha(-1), 0.5 to 4.0 kg N ha(-1) and 0.2 to 0.3 kg N ha(-1) during the rice-growing season, respectively. In terms of greenhouse gas intensity, the PN280 treatment is the recommended N application rate. Land-use conversion significantly reduced the global warming potential from croplands. The conversion shifted soils from an essential source of CH4 to a small net sink. In addition, N2O emissions from the rice-wheat rotation system were 1.8 times higher than from the orchard, mainly due to the difference in the N application rate. In summary, to reduce agriculture-induced GHG emissions, future research needs to focus on the effects of N inputs on rice-upland crop rotation systems.

AB The DNDC, LandscapeDNDC and IAP-N-GAS models have been designed to simulate the carbon and nitrogen processes of terrestrial ecosystems. Until now, a comparison of these models using simultaneous observations has not been reported, although such a comparison is essential for further model development and application. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the models, delineate the strengths and limitations of each model for simulating soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, and explore short-comings of these models that may require reconsideration. We conducted comparisons among the models using simultaneous observations of both gases and relevant variables from the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system at three field sites with calcareous soils. Simulations of N2O and NO emissions by the three models agreed well with annual observations, but not with daily observations. All models failed to correctly simulate soil moisture, which could explain some of the incorrect daily fluxes of N2O and NO, especially for intensive fluxes during the growing season. Multi-model ensembles are promising approaches to better simulate daily gas emissions. IAP-N-GAS underestimated the priming effect of straw incorporation on N2O and NO emissions, but better results were obtained with DNDC95 and LandscapeDNDC. LandscapeDNDC and IAP-N-GAS need to improve the simulation of irrigation water allocation and residue decomposition processes, respectively, and together to distinguish different irrigation methods as DNDC95 does. All three models overestimated the emissions of the nitrogenous gases for high nitrogen fertilizer (>430 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) addition treatments, and therefore, future research should focus more on the simulation of the limitation of soil dissolvable organic carbon on denitrification in calcareous soils.

AB NO fluxes from soils with a wide range of soil moistures, soil inorganic-N concentrations, and soil temperatures were measured during the wet and the dry season at a Venezuelan savannah site. Maximum No emissions (approximately 12 ngN m-2 s-1) were observed at soil gravimetric moistures between 10% and 18%. Deviation from this optimum range results in decreased NO fluxes; very low emissions (< 2 ngN m-2 s-1) were recorded at low (< 2%) and high (> 25%) soil moistures. Both NO production in soil and its transport within the soil play important roles in the emission of NO to the atmosphere. Under most conditions no temperature effect was observed. NO emission was strongly stimulated by the addition of NO3- and only very weakly by the addition of NH4+; at low and moderate soil moistures, soil nitrate and the NO flux were positively correlated. At low (natural) soil nitrate content and comparable soil moisture and temperature, No emissions were greater during the dry season than during the rainy season, suggesting that other factors (i.e., soil physical structure) may also govern No flux from savannah soil.

AB To cope with challenges of food security and water scarcity in rice production, water-saving ground cover rice production systems (GCRPSs) are increasingly adopted in China and globally. Reduced soil moisture as well as increased soil aeration and temperature under GCRPSs may promote soil N transformations, and in turn give rise to environmental challenges. These include emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO). Using conventional flooding rice cultivation as a reference, a three-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the performances of GCRPSs under inorganic (urea) or integrated nutrient management (a combination of synthetic and organic fertilizers), with regards to soil N2O and NO emissions as well as grain yields. N2O and NO emissions in GCRPSs exhibited high seasonal and interannual variations along with changes in soil inorganic N content and rainfall. When urea alone was applied, the average N2O and NO emissions from GCRPSs were 4.11 and 0.14 kg N ha(-1), respectively. These emissions were significantly higher than those of conventional rice cultivation, with 1.47 and 0.052 kg N ha(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively. When integrated nutrient management was performed for GCRPSs, N2O and NO emissions were reduced by approximately 77% and 50%, respectively, i.e., the emission magnitude comparable with N-trace gas losses from conventional rice cultivation. Moreover, GCRPSs with integrated nutrient management resulted in optimal grain yields, and thus, the yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions were the lowest compared to other treatments. Averaged over 3 years, the direct emission factors of N2O and NO for GCRPSs with urea alone were 2.58% and 0.064%, respectively. Those for GCRPSs with integrated nutrient management were 0.48% and 0.016%, respectively. The results of this study suggest that GCRPS with integrated nutrient management is an eco-friendly strategy for optimizing crop yields while mitigating N2O and NO emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The largest share of Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) anthropogenic greenhouse gases is derived from land use changes as well as forestry and agriculture, representing up to 67 % of the relative contribution from all sources. However, in spite of the rapid expansion of LAC tropical agriculture, little is known about its impact on atmospheric trace gases emissions, such as nitrogen oxides (NO (x) ), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which are produced in soils by microbial processes and also accelerated in tropical climates. This information is crucial for assessing mitigation strategies linked to agricultural practices to satisfy food demands for the region's future. We measured NO, N2O and CO2 soil emissions along with soil variables from corn fields under tillage (T) and no-tillage (NT) agriculture at two of the largest cereal-producing regions in Venezuela during the crop-growing season. We found statistically significant positive correlations between the logarithms of nitrogen gas emissions and soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations, soil water and clay contents. Average emissions of NO and CO2 were larger in T than NT sites, while N2O fluxes showed the opposite. CO2 emissions from T were 1.6 as much as those found in NT, whereas N2O was 0.5 of that found in NT. These results imply that NT practices more effectively mitigate climate change from these monoculture systems mainly because of CO2 emission reduction. We suggest then that agricultural mitigation actions for tropical monoculture systems should aim for the enhancement of NT management practices along with N fertilization rate reduction to compensate for the larger N2O emissions.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the photochemistry of the troposphere. NO from soil contributes up to 40% to the global budget of atmospheric NO. Soil NO emissions are primarily caused by biological activity (nitrification and denitrification), that occurs in the uppermost centimeter of the soil, a soil region often characterized by high contents of organic material. Most studies of NO emission potentials to date have investigated mineral soil layers. In our study we sampled soil organic matter under different understories (moss, grass, spruce and blueberries) in a humid mountainous Norway spruce forest plantation in the Fichtelgebirge (Germany). We performed laboratory incubation and flushing experiments using a customized chamber technique to determine the response of net potential NO flux to physical and chemical soil conditions (water content and temperature, bulk density, particle density, pH, C/N ratio, organic C, soil ammonium, soil nitrate). Net potential NO fluxes (in terms of mass of N) from soil samples taken under different understories ranged from 1.7-9.8 ng m(-2) s(-1) (soil sampled under grass and moss cover), 55.4-59.3 ng m(-2) s(-1) (soil sampled under spruce cover), and 43.7-114.6 ng m(-2) s(-1) (soil sampled under blueberry cover) at optimum water content and a soil temperature of 10 degrees C. The water content for optimum net potential NO flux ranged between 0.76 and 0.8 gravimetric soil moisture for moss covered soils, between 1.0 and 1.1 for grass covered soils, 1.1 and 1.2 for spruce covered soils, and 1.3 and 1.9 for blueberry covered soils. Effects of soil physical and chemical characteristics on net potential NO flux were statistically significant (0.01 probability level) only for NH4+. Therefore, as an alternative explanation for the differences in soil biogenic NO emission we consider more biological factors like understory vegetation type, amount of roots, and degree of mycorrhization; they have the potential to explain the observed differences of net potential NO fluxes.

AB Nitrogen (N) trace gas emission pulses produced after wetting dry soils may be important pathways of ecosystem N loss. However, the rates and mechanisms controlling these emissions remain unclear. We tested whether changes in microbial community structure and increased rates of atmospheric N deposition could explain N emissions at two desert sites differing in atmospheric N deposition by similar to six fold. We measured peak NOx (sum of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) emissions 12 h post-wetting. NOx emissions remained elevated over 24 h and increased after adding N. In contrast, we measured the highest nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions within only 15 min post-wetting. N2O emissions decreased within 12 h, were insensitive to adding N, and were among the highest reported globally. Microbial communities at the high N deposition site were less diverse with higher 16S nitrifier and bacterial amoA gene abundances relative to the low N deposition site, suggesting an increased capacity for nitrification. Nevertheless, N emissions were lower at the high N deposition site. While microbial communities changed after wetting, these changes were not correlated with N emissions. We conclude that desert soils can produce substantial NOx and N2O emission pulses, but that these emissions do not appear directly governed by changing microbial community characteristics or higher atmospheric N inputs. These findings highlight the importance of gaseous N loss pathways from dryland ecosystems that may contribute to sustained N limitation, with implications for atmospheric chemistry and Earth's climate.

AB Biochar amendments have been widely used in agricultural soil for lowering N2O and NO emissions while improving soil fertility and crop performance. However, a thorough understanding of the longevity of the favorable effects would be a prerequisite for large-scale biochar application in agriculture. We conducted a three-year greenhouse vegetable trial in Southeast China to systematically investigate the impacts of biochar mixed with nitrogen (N) on soil N2O and NO emissions, vegetable performance, and soil fertility at an interannual scale. The field experiment was established in November 2016 with biochar (0, 20 and 40 t ha(-1); C0, C1, and C2, respectively), applied once without/with 240 kg N ha(-1) urea (N0 or N1, respectively). Soil N2O and NO emissions were monitored during the spring vegetable cultivation period, and vegetable yield, quality, and soil properties were measured after harvests in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Results indicated that N application significantly increased N2O and NO emissions and vegetable yield throughout the trial period. Biochar combined with N generally reduced N2O and NO emissions and emission factors while increasing the vegetable yield, leading to lower yield-scaled N2O and NO emissions in 2018 and 2019. Biochar markedly enhanced soil pH and organic carbon and persisted, but generally had no significant effect on N use efficiency (NUE), vegetable quality, and soil fertility index (SFI) among treatments in over-fertilized vegetable fields. Based on our results, biochar application at 20 t ha(-1) combined with N seemed to achieve the highest agronomic and environmental benefits for intensive vegetable production in Southeast China.

AB Agriculture contributes about two-thirds of global NH3 emissions to the atmosphere, over one-third of N2O emissions, and about one-fourth of nitric oxide (NO) emissions. These gases have numerous deleterious effects on the environment, including eutrophication of downwind ecosystems (NH3 and NO), noxious odours (NH3), production of atmospheric aerosols that reduce air quality (NH3 and NO), tropospheric ozone (O-3) production (NO), stratospheric O-3 depletion (N2O), and global warming (N2O and tropospheric O-3 derived from reactions involving NO). Because nitrogen (N) amendments are commonly needed for optimal agricultural productivity, some Leakage of applied N out of agricultural fields and into aquatic and atmospheric reservoirs is probably inevitable. The magnitude of that leakage, however, can be controlled by sound management practices. Our knowledge of the processes of gaseous production and transport in soils should allow us to minimise this leakage, thereby protecting air and water quality while maintaining food security. We contend that, although new technological developments in fertiliser products would be helpful, sufficient understanding of the processes of gaseous N losses already exists to allow substantial decreases in N losses. Rather than technological and scientific know-how, the most important limiting factors to progress in this area appear to be socio-economic mechanisms to provide farmers with incentives and/or requirements to reduce emissions.

AB Irrigation has a significant impact on NxO (N2O and NO) emissions from cultivated land, yet the N2O or NO emission among the irrigation lower limits under different irrigation modes has not been well compared. In an irrigated lettuce field, three DR (drip irrigation) lower limits were designed, including 75% (DR1), 65% (DR2) and 55% (DR3) field capacity, and one FI (furrow irrigation) lower limit (65% field capacity). The N2O and NO emission fluxes and soil nitrogen (N) forms were determined, and the linear correlation between these indicators was analyzed. Results showed that under the same irrigation regime, the N2O and NO emissions from furrow irrigation treatment increased by 36.8% and 45.2% respectively compared to that from drip irrigation treatment. The cumulative N2O and NO emissions under DR3 were 30.2% and 28.6% higher than under DR1, respectively. Moreover, DR1 was also the lowest among the four treatments in soil-N NO- 3 concentration. The N2O and NO emission fluxes were more correlated to soil-N (r=0.88 and 0.76) or-N (r=0.90 and NH+ NO- 4 2 0.80) concentration than soil-N and soluble organic N, indicating that N2O and NO were mainly produced by the soil NO- 3 nitrification process. When the irrigation regime was the same, N2O and NO emissions were lower with drip irrigation than with furrow irrigation. Besides, drip irrigation with small quota but high frequency reduced N2O and NO emission compared to that with large quota but low frequency.

AB Soils are a significant source for the secondary greenhouse gas NO and assumed to be a significant source of tropospheric NOx in rural areas. Here we tested the LandscapeDNDC model for its capability to simulate magnitudes and dynamics of soil NO emissions for 22 sites differing in land use (arable, grassland and forest) and edaphic as well as climatic conditions. Overall, LandscapeDNDC simulated mean soil NO emissions agreed well with observations (r(2) = 0.82). However, simulated day to day variations of NO did only agree weakly with high temporal resolution measurements, though agreement between simulations and measurements significantly increased if data were aggregated to weekly, monthly and seasonal time scales. The model reproduced NO emissions from high and low emitting sites, and responded to fertilization (mineral and organic) events with pulse emissions. After evaluation, we linked the LandscapeDNDC model to a GIS database holding spatially explicit data on climate, land use, soil and management to quantify the contribution of soil biogenic NO emissions to the total NOx budget for the State of Saxony, Germany. Our calculations show that soils of both agricultural and forest systems are significant sources and contribute to about 8% (uncertainty range: 6 -13%) to the total annual tropospheric NO, budget for Saxony. However, the contributions of soil NO emission to total tropospheric NO, showed a high spatial variability and in some rural regions such as the Ore Mts., simulated soil NO emissions were by far more important than anthropogenic sources.

AB Straw return to agricultural soils is considered as a key strategy to improve soil organic C (SOC) sequestration and crop production. However, changes in SOC can affect soil N-turnover and associated N2O and NO fluxes, as soil biogeochemical C- and N-cycles are strongly coupled. Understanding how and to what extent N-trace gas emissions per unit crop yield respond to changes in SOC following straw return, is critical for balancing food security and climate change mitigation. Here we report on an experiment in a Chinese wheat-maize system designed to understand the effects of long-term (2005-2020) different straw management options (straw return, burning or removal) on SOC stocks and yields, completed by N2O and NO flux measurements over the period 2016-2020. Our results showed that the increase in SOC stocks following straw return tended to level off over time, indicating that SOC saturation is reached after 12-13 years under straw return. Soil N-trace gas emissions showed high inter- and intra-annual variability, which were largely driven by changes in rainfall, soil hydrothermal conditions or soil C- and N-availability. Compared to straw burning or removal, long-term straw return increased annual N2O emissions by 9 %-49 %, to 2.72-2.98 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), while NO emissions were decreased by 12 %-28 %, to 0.83-0.90 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The annual N2O emissions roughly offset the total C sink (SOC sequestration and CH4 uptake) by 40 %-46 %, but will override the climate benefits of total C sink as the SOC pool becomes saturated. However, because yields were higher in straw return treatments, yield-scaled annual N2O emissions remained unchanged. Our unique dataset allows for the first time a better understanding of the dynamics between SOC sequestration, yields and N-trace gas emissions, with results calling for action to address the risk of increasing N2O emissions following long-term SOC increases induced by straw return.

AB The relationships between soil microbial properties and nitrous oxide emission were examined in upland Soil under different tillage systems [no tillage (NT), rotary and plow tillage] and cover crop systems (fallow, cereal rye, and hairy vetch) in 2004 and 2005. Microbiological analyses included the determination of soil ergosterol as all indicator of fungal biomass, bacterial plate counting, and MPN estimations of ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers. The combined practice of NT with rye-cover crop treatment increased fungal biomass but not bacterial populations in 0-10 cm deep soils. Such increase in fungal biomass was not found in 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm deep cover-cropped NT soil. The combined practice of NT with rye-cover cropping resulted in higher in situ N2O emission rates compared with rotary- and plow-till treatments. N2O flux was positively correlated with soil ergosterol content but not with denitrifier MPN and other soil chemical properties. These results suggested a significant contribution of fungi to N2O emission in cover-cropped NT soils.

AB The nitrous oxide (N2O) molecule is both a greenhouse gas and a precursor to the formation of nitric oxide (NO) in the stratosphere, which is subsequently involved in catalytic destruction of ozone (O-3). Tropospheric NO can form NO2 with both gases (NOx) able to react with volatile organic compounds to produce the detrimental O-3 molecule. Information on how NO and N2O emissions respond to agricultural management is lacking. Limited data suggest N2O emissions following bovine urine deposition may vary with soil pH. This work hypothesised that soil liming would also reduce NOx emissions due to enhanced nitrification and reduced opportunity for HNO2 formation as soil pH increased. Bovine urine was applied (575 kg N/ha) to repacked soil cores (34% water-filled pore space) that ranged in pH from 4.4 to 7.6, and these were maintained at 21 degrees C. With the exception of the pH 4.4 treatment, increases in NO-N fluxes occurred during the first 11 days, when nitrification was proceeding. Increasing the initial soil pH enhanced the net ammonium depletion rate. The loss of NO-N, expressed as a percentage of the net ammonium depletion rate, decreased with increasing initial pH during this first 11 days with NO-N fluxes reduced due to competition between abiotic and biological demands for NO2-. After 21 days, the optimal pH for the net NO-N flux was observed to be 5.7 to 6.0. However, cumulative NO-N fluxes after 35 days showed little variation due to initial soil pH and ranged from 0.02 to 0.05% of urine-N applied. The cumulative N2O-N flux ranged from 0.04 to 0.09% of urine-N applied with a linear increase from pH 5.7 to pH 7.6. Based on these results, where soils are relatively dry, liming acid soils from pH 5.5 to pH 6.5 will not affect cumulative NO fluxes from urine patches. However, cumulative N2O fluxes may be enhanced.

AB Agricultural soils in semiarid Mediterranean areas are characterized by low organic matter contents and low fertility levels. Application of crop residues and/or manures as amendments is a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to overcome this problem. However, these management practices may induce important changes in the nitrogen oxide emissions from these agroecosystems, with additional impacts on carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, a field experiment was carried out with a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) crop under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effect of combining maize (Zea mays L.) residues and N fertilizer inputs (organic and/or mineral) on these emissions.
   Crop yield and N uptake, soil mineral N concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), denitrification capacity, N2O, NO and CO2 fluxes were measured during the growing season.
   The incorporation of maize stover increased N2O emissions during the experimental period by c. 105 %. Conversely, NO emissions were significantly reduced in the plots amended with crop residues. The partial substitution of urea by pig slurry reduced net N2O emissions by 46 and 39 %, with and without the incorporation of crop residues respectively. Net emissions of NO were reduced 38 and 17 % for the same treatments. Molar DOC:NO (3) (-) ratio was found to be a robust predictor of N2O and NO fluxes.
   The main effect of the interaction between crop residue and N fertilizer application occurred in the medium term (4-6 month after application), enhancing N2O emissions and decreasing NO emissions as consequence of residue incorporation. The substitution of urea by pig slurry can be considered a good management strategy since N2O and NO emissions were reduced by the use of the organic residue.

AB Southern Californian urban shrublands are exposed to high nitrogen (N) deposition, which can potentially enhance soil nitric oxide (NO) efflux; however, environmental controls on NO emission are still uncertain. We conducted a laboratory experiment to evaluate the NO efflux response of chaparral soil to variations in N availability, temperature and moisture. We hypothesized that NO efflux would increase with N addition, have an optimum response to soil moisture, and increase exponentially with temperature. Our results supported our hypotheses. Nitrogen addition caused a linear increase in NO efflux, primarily because of an increase in NH4+. NO efflux reached a peak at intermediate soil moisture (25% water-filled pore space (WFPS)), and the temperature response of NO flux was well-described by the Arrhenius model. However, there were statistically significant interactions between N, temperature and soil water content, making the NO response complex. Our results suggest that southern California urban shrublands may be important sources of NO, and that chronic, high levels of anthropogenic N deposition will enhance NO efflux from these ecosystems.

DT Article
AB Soil emission of gaseous N oxides during nitrification of ammonium represents loss of an available plant nutrient and has an important impact on the chemistry of the atmosphere. We used selective inhibitors and a glucose amendment in a factorial design to determine the relative contributions of autotrophic ammonium oxidizers, autotrophic nitrite oxidizers, and heterotrophic nitrifiers to nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from aerobically incubated soil following the addition of 160 mg of N as ammonium sulfate kg-1. Without added C, peak NO emissions of 4 .mu.g N kg-1 h-1 were increased to 15 .mu.g of N kg-1 h-1 by the addition of sodium chlorate, a nitrite oxidation inhibitor, but were reduced to 0.01 .mu.g of N kg-1 h-1 in the presence of nitrapyrin [2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)-pyridine], an inhibitor of autotrophic ammonium oxidation. Carbon-amended soils had somewhat higher NO emission rates from these three treatments (6, 18, and 0.1 .mu.g of N kg-1 h-1 after treatment with glucose, sodium chlorate, or nitrapyrin, respectively) until the glucose was exhausted but lower rates during the remainder of the incubation. Nitrous oxide emission levels exhibited trends similar to those observed for NO but were about 20 times lower. Periodic soil chemical analyses showed no increase in the nitrate concentration soil treated with sodium chlorate until after the period of peak NO and N2O emissions; the nitrate concentration of soil treated with nitrapyrin remained unchanged throughout the incubation. These results suggest that chemoautotrophic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria are the predominant source of NO and N2O produced during nitrification in soil.

AB Literature reports on N2O and NO emissions from organic and mineral agricultural soil amended with N-containing fertilizers have reached contradictory conclusions. To understand the influence of organic manure (OM) and chemical fertilizer application on N2O and NO emissions, we conducted laboratory incubation experiments on an agricultural sandy loam soil exposed to different long-term fertilization practices. The fertilizer treatments were initiated in 1989 at the Fengqiu State Key Agro-ecological Experimental Station and included a control without fertilizer (CK), OM, mineral NPK fertilizer (NPK), mineral NP fertilizer (NP), and mineral NK fertilizer (NK). The proportion of N emitted as NO and N2O varied considerably among fertilizer treatments, ranging from 0.83% to 2.50% as NO and from 0.08% to 0.36% as N2O. Cumulative NO emission was highest in the CK treatment after NH (4) (+) -N was added at a rate of 200 mg N kg(-1) soil during the 612-h incubation period, whereas the long-term application of fertilizers significantly reduced NO emission by 54-67%. In contrast, the long-term application of NPK fertilizer and OM significantly enhanced N2O emission by 95.6% and 253%, respectively, compared to CK conditions. The addition of NP fertilizer (no K) significantly reduced N2O emission by 25.5%, whereas applications of NK fertilizer (no P) had no effect. The difference among the N-fertilized treatments was due probably to discrepancies in the N2O production potential of the dominant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) species rather than AOB abundance. The ratio of NO/N2O was approximately 24 in the CK treatment, significantly higher than those in the N-fertilized treatments (3-11), and it decreased with increasing N2O production potential in N-fertilized treatments. Our data suggests that the shift in the dominant AOB species might produce reciprocal change in cumulative NO and N2O emissions.

AB [1] We measured the responses of nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) fertilization in a mature moist tropical forest and an 11-year-old pasture in the Brazilian Amazon. Nitrogen was applied in two forms, ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). In the forest, NO emissions increased by 4 to 9 times the controls in the NH4+ amended plots. Nitrous oxide emissions showed a small response only in the NH4+ amended plots. In the pasture, NO emissions during the first 7 days after fertilization with either form of N were about twice those in the control plots. Nitrous oxide emissions increased more than 18 times the controls in the NO3- amended plots 1 day after fertilization. The estimated yields of total nitrogen oxide loss from the forest were between 0.2 and 1.6% of the applied nitrogen, predominately as NO. Pasture yields were greater, up to 2.8% of the applied nitrogen, predominately as N2O. In the context of Rondonia and other regions in the Amazon Basin, pasture management practices are changing to include increased use of fertilizer, particularly in older pastures that have lower NO and N2O emissions than the original intact forests. This may lead to large short-term releases of N2O and alter the future N2O emissions from the Basin.

AB While much is known about control of production of NO and N2O by nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria at the cellular level, application of this knowledge to field studies has not yielded unifying concepts that are widely applicable and that foster understanding of global sources of these atmospheric trace gases. We applied a simple conceptual model to the investigation of sources of NO and N2O and the environmental factors affecting fluxes in a drought-deciduous forest of Mexico.
   Fluxes of NO and N2O were higher in the wet season than the dry season, but addition of water to dry soil caused large pulses of CO2, NO, and N2O emissions. Immediate increases of extractable soil NH4+ and high rates of gross N mineralization and gross nitrification also were observed following wetting of dry soil. Soil NO2- had accumulated during the dry season, and that NO2- plus the pulse of increased soil NH4+ were mostly consumed within 24 hours of wetting. This dynamic microbial processing of soil inorganic N coincided with the pulses of NO and N2O production following wetting of dry soil.
   Acetylene inhibition experiments indicated that NO production was dependent on nitrification, that nitrification was the dominant source of N2O when the soil was wetted at the end of the dry season, and that denitrification might be an important source of N2O during the wet season. Post-wetting soil moisture was correlated negatively with NO fluxes and positively with N2O fluxes. These results support a conceptual model in which N trace gas production is generally constrained by the rates of N mineralization and nitrification, while the specific ratios of NO and N2O fluxes and the contributions from nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria are controlled largely by soil moisture.

AB Little information is available on nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from alpine ecosystems. We measured NO fluxes in control and nitrogen (N) addition (NH4NO3, 6 g N m(-2) year(-1)) plots from early June through October 2013 in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau, China. During the sample period, NO fluxes varied from -0.71 to 3.12 ug m(-2) h(-1) and -0.46 to 7.54 ug m(-2) h(-1) for control and N treatment plots. The mean NO emission in N addition plots (1.68 ug m(-2) h(-1)) was 2.15 times higher than the control plots (0.78 ug m(-2) h(-1)), indicating that alpine meadows may be a source of atmospheric NO, and N additions stimulated NO flux. A positive correlation was found between NO flux and soil temperature, water-filled pore space (WFPS), nitrate (NO3--N) content but no correlation with soil ammonium (NH4+-N). These results suggest that denitrification is a principal process producing NO flux from alpine meadows.

AB Fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) were measured from the summer of 1994 to the spring of 1995 from an intensively managed agricultural soil using a dynamic flow through chamber technique in order to study the seasonal variability in the emissions of NO. The measurements were made on a Norfolk sandy loam (Fine-Loamy, Siliceous, Thermic Typic Paleudult) soil located at an agricultural research station in the Upper Coastal Plain region of North Carolina. Soil nitric oxide fluxes from 3 crops, representing 3 levels of fertilizer application (corn, 168 kg N ha(-1); cotton, 68 kg N ha(-1) and soybean, 0 kg N ha(-1)), were measured in each season (summer, fall, winter, and spring). Additional measured soil parameters included soil temperature, soil water content (expressed as percent water filled pore space, %WFPS), and extractable nitrogen. The greatest NO flux observed in each crop occurred during the summer (June to August) measurement period (corn, 21.9 +/- 18.6 ng N m(-2) s(-1); cotton, 4.3 +/- 3.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1); and soybean, 2.1 +/- 0.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1)). NO flux decreased in each crop through the fall months to a minimum flux in the winter. Application of fertilizer during the spring months once again produced substantial NO flux, but not as high as during the summer months. Over 80% of NO flux from the three crops measured occurred in the summer months with an estimated 5% of the nitrogen applied as fertilizer emitted as NO in a year's time. The corn crop, which had the highest amount of applied fertilizer, had the highest average yearly NO flux (7.0 +/- 4.8 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) followed by cotton and soybean in order (1.7 +/- 1.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and 1.0 +/- 0.3 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively). NO flux from soil tracked soil temperature very closely throughout the year, especially through the summer and spring months. However, NO flux measured under a cotton canopy decreased when soil temperature was >25 degrees C and soil moisture content was <20%WFPS. Overall, the data support the assumption that in the Southeast United States, which has naturally emitted VOC's and large acreages of fertilized soils, NO emissions from agricultural soils may result in the formation of tropospheric ozone, especially during the summer months when NO emissions are highest.

AB We measured nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions during the snow-free season (April-November) over a 3-year period (1998-2000) from a Silandic Andosols Cultivated with maize (Zea mays L.) in central Hokkaido, Japan. In May, before furrowing, composted cattle manure was broadcast onto the field at a rate of 3.0 g N m(-2). After furrowing, chemical fertilizer (NH4)(2)SO4-N + (NH4)(3)PO4-N : urea-N at a ratio of 10:3 was applied to the row at a rate of 13 g N m(-2). An impermeable layer lay 1.3 in below ground level. As a result, after heavy rains and during the snow-melting period, the groundwater table rose to near the ground surface. The N2O and NO emission rates ranged from 0.0 to 6.4 and from 0.00 to 0.94 mg N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The highest N2O emission was observed after heavy rain in summer and autumn. The magnitude and seasonal pattern of N2O emissions from the inter row were similar to those from the row itself, although chemical fertilizer had not been applied to the inter row. In contrast, all increase in NO emissions was observed only from the row. Seasonal fluctuations ill Soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations and the emission ratio N2O-N/NO-N suggested that N2O and NO emitted after fertilizer application (May to early July) were produced mainly by nitrification, whereas N2O emitted after heavy rains (after mid-July) was produced mainly by derntrification. Total N2O and NO emissions during the snow-free season ranged from 0.7 to 2.8 and from 0.0 to 0.7 g N m(-2), respectively, over a 3-year period. The N2O and NO emissions from our field were relatively high compared with those reported worldwide. In contrast, reported N2O emission rates from agricultural Andosols in Japan are typically lower than those from other agricultural soils in Japan and around the world. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that high N2O emissions may occur from Japanese agricultural Andosols that are poorly drained.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is a key substance in atmospheric chemistry, influencing the formation and destruction of tropospheric ozone and the atmosphere's oxidizing capacity. It also affects the physiological functions of organisms. NO is produced, consumed, and emitted by soils, the effects of soil NO concentrations on microbial C and N cycling and associated trace gas fluxes remain largely unclear. This study describes a new automated 12-chamber soil mesocosm system that dynamically changes incoming airflow composition. It was used to investigate how varying NO concentrations affect soil microbial C and N cycling and associated trace gas fluxes under different moisture conditions (30% and 50% WFPS). Based on detection limits for NO, NO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes of < 0.5 <mu>g N or C m(-2) h(-1) and for CO2 fluxes of < 1.2 mg C m(-2 )h(-1), we found that soil CO2, CH4, NO, NO2, and N2O were significantly affected by different soil moisture levels. After 17 days cumulative fluxes at 50% WFPS increased by 40, 400, and 500% for CO2, N2O, and CH4, respectively, when compared to 30% WFPS. However, cumulative fluxes for NO, and NO2, decreased by 70, and 40%, respectively, at 50% WFPS when compared to 30% WFPS. Different NO concentrations tended to decrease soil C and N fluxes by about 10-20%. However, with the observed variability among individual soil mesocosms and minor fluxes change. In conclusion, the developed system effectively investigates how and to what extent soil NO concentrations affect soil processes and potential plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere.

Nitrogen additions in 1992 as KNO3, NH4Cl, or urea (100 kg N.ha(-1)) were used to study the fate and transformations of N in peat. The mean N2O emissions during the growth season in 1993 were 1.9, 2.6, 3.3, and 3.5 mg N.m(-2).day(-1) in the control soil, KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea-treated soils, respectively. Mean NO fluxes during the growth season in 1993 averaged 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, and 0.6 mg N.m(-2).day(-1) in the control soil, KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea treatment, respectively. Annual net N mineralization was 87 kg N.ha(-1) in the control soil and 107, 129, and 91 kg.ha(-1) in the KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea-treated soils, respectively. Added N increased the fluxes of N oxides at least for a year after the treatments. The study showed that forests on drained N-rich peat soils may be significant sources of N2O and NO and that their production of nitrogenous trace gases is enhanced by additional N.

AB Changes in weather and management practices such as manure and fertilizer applications have a major effect on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions from soils. N2O and NO emissions exhibit high intra- and inter-annual fluctuations, which are also highly influenced by land-use change. In this study we investigated how land-use change between grassland and cornfield affects soil N2O and NO emissions using long-term field measurements in a mollic andosol soil in Southern Hokkaido, Japan. Soil N2O and NO emissions were monitored for 5years in a 30-year old grassland (OG), which was then plowed and converted to a cornfield for 3years and then converted back to grassland (new grassland, NG) for another 3years. We established four treatment plots: control, without any nitrogen (N) input (CT plot); chemical fertilizer only (F plot); chemical fertilizer and manure (MF plot); and manure only (M plot).Changing land use from OG to cornfield increased annual N2O emissions by 6-7 times, while the change from cornfield to NG resulted in a 0.3-0.6 times reduction in annual N2O emissions. N2O emissions in the newly established grassland were 2-5 times higher than those in the 30-year old grassland. Soil mineral N (NO3- and NH4+) was higher in cornfield, followed by NG and lowest in OG, while water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) did not significantly change with changing land use but tended to be higher in OG and NG than in cornfield. The ratio of WEOC to soil NO3- was the most important explanatory variable for differences in N2O emissions as land use changed. High N input, surplus soil N, and precipitation and low soil pH led to increased N2O emissions. N2O emissions in fertilizer- and/or manure-amended plots were 3-4, 2-5 and 1.4-2 times higher than those in the control treatment in OG, cornfield and NG, respectively. NO emissions were largely influenced by soil mineral N and N addition, and showed less response to changing land use. There were high inter-annual variations in both NO and N2O emissions in all plots, including the control treatment, highlighting the need for long-term measurements when determining local emission rates.

AB Field measurements of soil emissions of NO from a Mountview silt loam soil with three land uses (forest, fertilized pasture, and fertilized corn) were made on a commercial farm during a summer and autumn sampling period. A new automated closed-chamber sampling system was developed to allow simultaneous measurements on five chambers per 100 m2 plot. Individual chambers with hinged tops, covering 0.3 m2 of soil area were pneumatically operated via data logger control to sample soil NO flux every third hour. Spatial variability in emission rates was high. For each land use type the range from the lowest to the highest emitting chamber was approximately threefold. Land use type significant affected soil NO emissions. The fertilized pasture had the highest mean emission rate (44.1 ng N m-2 s-1), followed by the fertilized com (27.0 ng N m-2 s-1), and the forest (8.4 ng N m-2 s-1). NO emission rates and soil nitrate levels at the forest plot were considerably higher than at other forest sites in the region, possibly due to runoff from an adjacent fertilized hayfield. The results of this study, when extrapolated to a regional estimate, suggest that emissions of NO from soils could play a significant role in summertime tropospheric ozone photochemistry in the southeastern United States.

AB Riparian buffers are expedient interventions for water quality functions in agricultural landscapes. However, the choice of vegetation and management affects soil microbial communities, which in turn affect nutrient cycling and the production and emission of gases such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen gas (N-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). To investigate the potential fluxes of the above-mentioned gases, soil samples were collected from a cropland and downslope grass, willow and woodland riparian buffers from a replicated plot scale experimental facility. The soils were re-packed into cores and to investigate their potential to produce the aforementioned gases via potential denitrification, a potassium nitrate (KNO3-) and glucose (labile carbon)-containing amendment, was added prior to incubation in a specialized laboratory DENItrification System (DENIS). The resulting NO, N2O, N-2 and CO2 emissions were measured simultaneously, with the most NO (2.9 & PLUSMN; 0.31 mg NO m(-2)) and N2O (1413.4 & PLUSMN; 448.3 mg N2O m(-2)) generated by the grass riparian buffer and the most N-2 (698.1 & PLUSMN; 270.3 mg N-2 m(-2)) and CO2 (27,558.3 & PLUSMN; 128.9 mg CO2 m(-2)) produced by the willow riparian buffer. Thus, the results show that grass riparian buffer soils have a greater NO3- removal capacity, evidenced by their large potential denitrification rates, while the willow riparian buffers may be an effective riparian buffer as its soils potentially promote complete denitrification to N-2, especially in areas with similar conditions to the current study.

AB We measured nitrogen oxides (N2O and NOx), dinitrogen (N-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a C spruce-fir-beech forest soil in the North Tyrolean limestone Alps in Austria. The site received 10.6-11.9 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) nitrogen as bulk deposition. Fluxes of nitric oxide N were measured by an automatic dynamic chamber system on an hourly basis over a two year period. Daily N2O emissions were obtained by a semi-automatic gas measuring system. In order to cover spatial variability biweekly manual measurements of N2O and CO2 emissions were carried out in addition. For acquiring information on the effects of soil and meteorological conditions and of N-deposition on N-emissions we chose the auto-regression procedure (time-series analysis) as our means of investigation. Hence, we could exclude the data's autocorrelation in the course of the time. We found that soil temperature, soil moisture and bulk N-deposition followed by air temperature and precipitation were the most powerful influencing parameters effecting N-emissions. With these variables, up to 89% of observed temporal variations of N-emissions could be explained. During the two-year investigation period between 2.5 and 3.5% of deposited N was reemitted in form of N2O whereas only 0.2% were emitted as NO. At our mountain forest site the main end-product of microbial activity processes was N-2 and trace gases (N2O and NO) were only of minor importance.

AB Agricultural soil is the major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). However, N2O and NO fluxes from the soil show high spatial and temporal variability. Therefore, traditional statistical tools are insufficient for evaluating the strength of the emissions and determining the environmental and management factors affecting these fluxes. To compensate for the inherent variability of N oxide fluxes in situ, we proposed the application of a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model based on a simple semi-mechanistic model with a lognormal probability distribution. We applied the HB model to the daily N2O and NO fluxes from an Andosol soil field to which a chemical N fertilizer was applied. In addition, we evaluated the responses of these fluxes to environmental factors and N application. The posterior inference revealed various sensitivities to the soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) among the N oxide gas fluxes. The N2O flux showed a higher temperature dependency compared with the NO flux. The estimated optimum WFPS of the NO flux (54.1% with credible interval (CI) 95%, from 47.1% to 79.4%) was lower than that of the N2O flux (75.8% with CI 95%, from 54.1% to 98.3%) in this soil sample. Although control plots without N fertilizer application are usually required to calculate the fertilizer-induced emission factor (EF), our HB model could estimate EFs and their uncertainties using posterior simulations (for N2O 0.077% with CI 95% high probability density, from 0.056% to 0.191%; for NO 0.875% with CI 95% high probability density, from 0.552% to 2.05%). Our HB model can be easily applied to the observations of the N2O and NO fluxes because it requires only several explanatory variables and can be used to evaluate the flux uncertainties and responses of the nonlinear N oxide fluxes to environmental factors.

AB We used an enclosure technique to monitor soil NO and N2O emissions during early summer regrowth of Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) on sandy loam in a humid, subtropical region of southern Texas. The evolution of both gases was substantially higher from plots harvested at the beginning of the experiment and fertilized 5 days later with 52 kg N ha-1 as (NH4)2SO4 than from plots not harvested or fertilized. Emission of NO, but not N2O, was stimulated by clipping and removing the grass, probably because eliminating the shading provided by the dense grass canopy changed these plots from cooler to warmer than unharvested plots, thereby stimulating the activity of soil microorganisms responsible for NO production. Neither gas flux was significantly affected by application of N until the next rainfall dissolved and moved the surface-applied fertilizer into the soil. Immediately thereafter, emissions of NO and N2O increased dramatically to peaks of 160 and 12 g N ha-1 d-1 respectively, and then declined at rates that closely paralleled the nitrification rate of added NH4+, indicating that the gases resulted from the activity of nitrifying microorganisms, rather than denitrifiers. Nitric oxide emissions during the 9-week measurement period averaged 7.2 times greater than N2O emissions and accounted for 3.2% of the added N. The data indicate that humid, subtropical grasslands, which not only have large geographical extent but also have been subject to intense anthropogenic disturbance, contribute significantly to the global atmospheric NOx budget.

AB Once emitted to the atmosphere, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) regulate several important processes in the troposphere and stratosphere. Understanding controls over N oxide gas emissions from fertilized soils is often complicated by highly heterogeneous and dynamic field conditions. An intact soil core method is described here for examining multiple subsurface controls concurrently with N oxide surface fluxes under hydrostatic and isothermal conditions dominated by Fickian diffusive transport. The method allows for simultaneous measurement of inorganic N levels, pH, water content, and soil-gas concentrations of NO, N(2)O, O(2), and CO(2) and for subsequent calculation of N mass balances, net nitrification rates, CO(2) respiration rates, O(2) uptake rates, fraction of nitrified N lost as gas, and anaerobic microsite fraction profiles. The method is applied to moderately acidic soil fertilized with anhydrous ammonia. Steady nitrification and persistent NO(2)(-) levels resulted in NO gaseous losses representing 22-37% of the inorganic N initially present and >50% of the nitrified N. Of the initial N mass present, 96-119% was accounted for as N solutes and gases. High N(2)O soil-gas concentrations (5-20 mg N m(-3)) and fluxes (1 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) persisted despite anaerobic fractions of less than or equal to 10(-10) m(3) anaerobic Soil m(-3) soil, suggesting that N(2)O sources other than denitrification were important.

AB Tillage practices result in major changes to soil environmental conditions and to the distribution of crop residues and nutrients in the soil profile, which may consequently affect the biogenic production and emission of N trace gases. To investigate the effects of tillage during the nonwaterlogged period on nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in rice-wheat rotation systems, we performed field experiments at three sites (Suzhou, Wuxi, and Jiangdu) in the Yangtze River Delta using static chamber techniques. The results showed that the effect of tillage on the emissions of both gases differed among the three field sites due to differences in agricultural management and soil texture. At the site with a light soil texture (Jiangdu: sandy loam), no tillage resulted in reduced NO emissions (0.5 kg N ha(-1)) as compared to conventionally tilled fields (0.9 kg N ha(-1); p < 0.05). Regarding N2O, the no tillage plots showed significantly higher emissions (p < 0.05) in comparison to the tilled plots (3.9 versus 2.2 kg N ha(-1)) when the fields were merely amended with synthetic N fertilizers. However, this effect was not significant when wheat straw was used in addition to synthetic N fertilizers during the preceding rice season. In the clay loam soils (Wuxi), no tillage resulted in lower NO and higher N2O emissions from either N fertilized or unfertilized fields even though these results were not statistically significant. In the silty clay loam soils (Suzhou), which showed the highest soil organic carbon contents and the highest rates of N trace gas emissions in all three of the investigated sites, reduced tillage resulted in much higher NO emissions, whereas N2O emissions were not obviously influenced by tillage practices (reduced tillage versus tillage: NO, 9.5 versus 5.4 kg N ha(-1); N2O, 10.6 versus 9.0 kg N ha(-1)). Similar effects of tillage were observed for the direct emission factors of the applied N during the wheat season. The observed emission factors for the different sites ranged from 0.3% to 2.4% for N2O (mean: 1.0%) and from 0.1% to 4.0% (mean: 0.9%) for NO, respectively. The observed site-to-site differences in emission factors are most likely the results of variations in soil properties (such as texture and pH) and agricultural practices (such as tillage and crop residue management) or in the amount and pattern of precipitation.

AB Sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere has been demonstrated to have many adverse impacts on the environment and human health. In this study, deposition of SO2 ranging from 9.0 to 127.8 similar to mg similar to kg-1 with an average of 35.7 similar to mg similar to S similar to kg-1 was found to substantially stimulate NO and N2O emissions from soils in the humid subtropical areas of Hainan, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Yunnan provinces of China under field conditions. Laboratory tests indicated that the stimulations were mediated biologically as the effects were not observed in sterilized soils. Acidification of soil resulting from SO2 deposition was not responsible for the stimulated NO and N2O emissions alone as the stimulation did not occur by acidifying soil with HNO3 treatment. By using the 15N tracing method, we found that the N2O emissions stimulated by SO2 deposition were from either denitrification, heterotrophic nitrification or both, but not from autotrophic nitrification. Therefore, atmospheric SO2 deposition would most likely stimulate NO and N2O emissions in acidic soils in which heterotrophic nitrification dominates NO and N2O production and waterlogged soils in which denitrification dominates NO and N2O production.

AB Strong seasonal variability of hygric and thermal soil conditions are a defining environmental feature in northern Australia. However, how such changes affect the soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and dinitrogen (N-2) is still not well explored. By incubating intact soil cores from four sites (three savanna, one pasture) under controlled soil temperatures (ST) and soil moisture (SM) we investigated the release of the trace gas fluxes of N2O, NO and carbon dioxide (CO2). Furthermore, the release of N-2 due to denitrification was measured using the helium gas flow soil core technique. Under dry pre-incubation conditions NO and N2O emissions were very low (< 7.0 +/- 5.0 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1); < 0.0 +/- 1.4 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) or in the case of N2O, even a net soil uptake was observed. Substantial NO (max: 306.5 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and relatively small N2O pulse emissions (max: 5.8 +/- 5.0 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) were recorded following soil wetting, but these pulses were short lived, lasting only up to 3 days. The total atmospheric loss of nitrogen was generally dominated by N-2 emissions (82.4-99.3% of total N lost), although NO emissions contributed almost 43.2% to the total atmospheric nitrogen loss at 50% SM and 30 degrees C ST incubation settings (the contribution of N-2 at these soil conditions was only 53.2 %). N2O emissions were systematically higher for 3 of 12 sample locations, which indicates substantial spatial variability at site level, but on average soils acted as weak N2O sources or even sinks. By using a conservative upscale approach we estimate total annual emissions from savanna soils to average 0.12 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (N2O), 0.68 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (NO) and 6.65 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (N-2). The analysis of long-term SM and ST records makes it clear that extreme soil saturation that can lead to high N2O and N-2 emissions only occurs a few days per year and thus has little impact on the annual total. The potential contribution of nitrogen released due to pulse events compared to the total annual emissions was found to be of importance for NO emissions (contribution to total: 5-22 %), but not for N2O emissions. Our results indicate that the total gaseous release of nitrogen from these soils is low and clearly dominated by loss in the form of inert nitrogen. Effects of seasonally varying soil temperature and moisture were detected, but were found to be low due to the small amounts of available nitrogen in the soils (total nitrogen < 0.1 %).

AB Reactive nitrogen oxides (NOy; NOy = NO + NO2 + HONO) decrease air quality and impact radiative forcing, yet the factors responsible for their emission from nonpoint sources (i.e., soils) remain poorly understood. We investigated the factors that control the production of aerobic NOy in forest soils using molecular techniques, process-based assays, and inhibitor experiments. We subsequently used these data to identify hotspots for gas emissions across forests of the eastern United States. Here, we show that nitrogen oxide soil emissions are mediated by microbial community structure (e.g., ammonium oxidizer abundances), soil chemical characteristics (pH and C:N), and nitrogen (N) transformation rates (net nitrification). We find that, while nitrification rates are controlled primarily by chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), the production of NOy is mediated in large part by chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Variation in nitrification rates and nitrogen oxide emissions tracked variation in forest communities, as stands dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees had greater N transformation rates and NOy fluxes than stands dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. Given mapped distributions of AM and ECM trees from 78,000 forest inventory plots, we estimate that broadleaf forests of the Midwest and the eastern United States as well as the Mississippi River corridor may be considered hotspots of biogenic NOy emissions. Together, our results greatly improve our understanding of NOy fluxes from forests, which should lead to improved predictions about the atmospheric consequences of tree species shifts owing to land management and climate change.

AB Camellia oleifera, an important woody oil crop, is primarily grown in the acidic laterite regions. As an economic plantation distributed in subtropical area where characterized by seasons with high temperature and low precipitation, ensuring adequate soil moisture is pivotal for achieving high and stable yields in C. oleifera plantation soil, which potentially impact soil gaseous nitrogen emissions associated with global climate change. However, few studies have been reported on the impact of modified water-retaining agents on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. This study aims to investigate the effects of water-retaining agent polyacrylamide (PAM) and C. oleifera fruit shell-derived biochar-modified PAM (MP) on soil water retention ability and the emissions of N2O and NO from C. oleifera plantation soil. Specifically, the effects of PAM (0.4 %oPAM, and 1 %o PAM) and biochar-modified PAM (4 %MP, 10%MP) on the emissions of N2O and NO, soil physicochemical properties, and the abundance of relevant microbial functional genes in C. oleifera plantation soil was examined. The results indicated that both PAM and biochar modified PAM significantly altered soil moisture, soil physicochemical properties, and the abundance of associated microbial functional genes. Soil NO emissions were reduced by 15.90 %, 18.54 %, 16.01 %, and 30.34 % by the application of 0.4%o, 1%o, 4 % ModiPAM, and 10 % ModiPAM, respectively. The application of the modified water-retaining agents increased soil moisture, reduced soil NO emissions by affecting the abundance of functional genes involved in nitrification and denitrification processes via increases in soil pH. The application of water-retaining agents, especially MP, offers a beneficial approach to soil moisture management and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The optimal ratio and application methods of water-retaining agents should be explored by future studies to maximize benefits.

AB The use of N-15 tracer provides a suitable technique to investigate the processes of N transformation in soils and the origin of the environmentally relevant gaseous N compounds N2O and NO from nitrification and denitrification. incubation experiments with black earth soil under two different water contents are presented here. Nitrification and denitrification proceeded simultaneously, but the importance of these two microbial processes shifted depending on the water content of the soil. Under water-unsaturated conditions the microbial oxidation of NH4+ to NO3- predominated, but a reduction of NO3- also occurred. The emission of NO exceeded the emission of N2O by a factor of up to 20 at the beginning of the experiments. Under water-saturated conditions denitrification was the dominant process of N transformation in the soil. However, nitrification also occurred to a considerable extent. The emission of N2O was greater than under unsaturated conditions. The formation of NO could hardly be observed. N loss by molecular nitrogen from denitrification could be detected under saturated conditions. The N loss amounted to 60% of NO3- and thereby the cumulative N ratio of N-2 to N2O was 3. Under either unsaturated or saturated conditions NO arose from NO2- or during the microbial oxidation of NH4+ to NO2-. However, N2O mainly formed from denitrification under both conditions. Furthermore, NO could not be observed as a precursor of N2O and the free NO2- could not be detected as a common N pool for the formation of N2O and NO. High emissions of NO could be a problem for the black earth soil in the semi-arid climate in central Germany, if there are large amounts of NH4+ in the soil after fertilisation.

AB Current understanding of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes associated with land-use change from forest to oil palm on mineral soil is not sufficient to provide reliable estimates of emission rates or advice on GHG mitigation strategies. Monocultures of oil palm have expanded in Southeast Asia, mostly replacing tropical forests. The limited data available have indicated that the land-use conversion is associated with a potentially aggravated GHG burden, including nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, with unclear underlying biological mechanisms. In this study, we investigated N2O and NO emission potentials of tropical soils with different land-uses from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, under laboratory incubation. Under similar controlled conditions, logged forest and oil palm soils showed high and similar potentials of N2O and NO emissions following increase in soil moisture, while the emissions were negligible in a riparian reserve soil irrespective of moisture conditions. Soil N2O and NO emission rates from logged forest soils and oil palm (OP) plantations were of similar magnitude, with average fluxes over the 35 and 22 day incubation periods, respectively, of 11.5 and 1.6 ng N g(-1) h(-1) (OP) and 15.6 and 6.0 ng N g(-1) h(-1) (logged forest). Contrarily, the riparian reserve soil did not respond to rewetting and nitrogen application and fluxes were negligible. Furthermore, N2O fluxes were on average about 10 times higher than NO fluxes. The fact that forest soils also have the potential to emit large amounts of N2O and NO, has important implications for land-use change scenarios in the tropics, especially as some scenarios suggest atmospheric N deposition is likely to drastically increase in tropical regions due to biomass burning, increased N-fertilizer use and fossil fuel consumption. Quantification of related gene transcripts implied that Proteobacterial nirS and AniA-nirK (betaproteobacterial clade of Neisseria) containing denitrifiers might continuously contribute to the N2O emissions, while the nitrifiers (ammonia oxidizing archaea in this study) are conditionally active to produce N2O. This study therefore provides some evidence for N2O and NO emissions associated with phylogenetically diverse groups of microorganisms, which might be of importance in modulating the GHG emissions under different land-uses and field conditions.

AB The effect of nitrate and ammonium application (0, 50, 100 and 150 mg N kg(-1) soil) was studied in an incubation experiment. Four Belgian soils, selected for different soil characteristics, were used. The application of both nitrate and ammonium caused an increase of the NO and N2O emission. The NO production from nitrate and ammonium was found to be of the same order of magnitude. At low pH the NO production was found to be highest from nitrate, at higher pH values the production was found to be higher from ammonium. This seems to be the result of the negative effect of low pH on nitrification.
   The ANOVA analysis was carried out to separate the effect of the form of nitrogen, quantity of N applied and soil characteristics. The total production of NO was found to depend for 97% on the soil characteristics and for 3% on the quantity of N added. The total N2O production depended for 100% on the soil characteristics.
   Stepwise regression analysis showed that the total NO production was best predicted by a combination of the factors CaCO3 content and NH4+ concentration in the soil. Total N2O production was best described by a combination of CaCO3, water soluble carbon (WSC) and sand-content.
   The N2O/NO ratio was found to be highly variable, indicating that their productions react differently to changes in conditions, or are partly independent.
   It may be concluded that to NO and N2O from soils both nitrification and denitrification may be equally important, their relative importance depending on local conditions such as substrate availability, water content of the soil etc. However, the NO production seems to be more nitrification dependent than the N2O production.

AB Surficial enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategy that involves applying crushed silicate rock (e.g., basalt) to agricultural soils. However, unintended biogeochemical interactions with the nitrogen cycle may arise through ERW increasing soil pH as basalt grains undergo dissolution that may reinforce, counteract, or even offset the climate benefits from carbon sequestration. Increases in soil pH could drive changes in the soil emissions of key non-CO2 greenhouse gases, e.g., nitrous oxide (N2O), and trace gases, e.g., nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3), that affect air quality and crop and human health. We present the development and implementation of a new improved nitrogen cycling scheme for the Community Land Model v5 (CLM5), the land component of the Community Earth System Model, allowing evaluation of ERW effects on soil gas emissions. We base the new parameterizations on datasets derived from soil pH responses of N2O, NO, and NH3 in ERW field trial and mesocosm experiments with crushed basalt. These new capabilities involve the direct implementation of routines within the CLM5 N cycle framework, along with asynchronous coupling of soil pH changes estimated through an ERW model. We successfully validated simulated "control" (i.e., no ERW) seasonal cycles of soil N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions against a wide range of global emission inventories. We benchmark simulated mitigation of soil N2O fluxes in response to ERW against a subset of data from ERW field trials in the US Corn Belt. Using the new scheme, we provide a specific example of the effect of large-scale ERW deployment with croplands on soil nitrogen fluxes across five key regions with high potential for CDR with ERW (North America, Brazil, Europe, India, and China). Across these regions, ERW implementation led to marked reductions in N2O and NO (both 18%), with moderate increases in NH3 (2%). While further developments are still required in our implementations when additional ERW data become available, our improved N cycle scheme within CLM5 has utility for investigating the potential of ERW point-source and regional effects of soil N2O, NO, and NH3 fluxes in response to current and future climates. This framework also provides the basis for assessing the implications of ERW for air quality given the role of NO in tropospheric ozone formation, as well as both NO and NH3 in inorganic aerosol formation.

AB Quantifying the nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes emitted from croplands remains a major challenge. Field measurements in different climates, soil and agricultural conditions are still scarce and emissions are generally assessed from a small number of measurements. In this study, we report continuously measured N2O and NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over a 2-year crop sequence of barley and maize in northern France. Measurements were carried out using 6 automatic chambers at a rate of 16 mean flux measurements per day. Additional laboratory measurements on soil cores were conducted to study the response of NO and N2O emissions to environmental conditions.
   The detection limit of the chamber setup was found to be 3 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for N2O and 0.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for NO. Nitrous oxide fluxes were higher than the threshold 37% of the time, while they were 72% of the time for NO fluxes.
   The cumulated annual NO and N2O emissions were 1.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 0.5 kg NO-N ha(-1) in 2007, but 2.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 0.7 kg NO-N ha(-1) in 2008. These inter-annual differences were largely related to crop types and to their respective management practices. The forms, amounts and timing of nitrogen applications and the mineralization of organic matter by incorporation of crop residues were found to be the main factor controlling the emissions peaks. The inter-annual variability was also due to different weather conditions encountered in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, the fractioned N inputs applied on barley (54 kg ha(-1) in March and in April) did not generate N2O emissions peaks because of the low rainfall during the spring. However, the significant rainfall observed in the summer and fall of 2007, promoted rapid decomposition of barley residues which caused high levels of N2O emissions. In 2008, the application of dairy cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer before the emergence of maize (107 kg N-min ha(-1) or 130 kg N-tot ha(-1) in all) coincided with large rainfalls promoting both NO and N2O emissions, which remained high until early summer.
   Laboratory measurements corroborated the field observations: NO fluxes were maximum at a water-filled pore space (WFPS) of around 27% while N2O fluxes were optimal at 68% WFPS, with a maximum potentially 14 times larger than for NO. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High rates of atmospheric N deposition can increase ecosystem N availability and stimulate N losses from soils via nitric oxide (NO; an air pollutant at high concentrations) and nitrous oxide (N2O; a strong greenhouse gas) emissions as predicted by N saturation theory. However, it remains unclear whether theories developed in mesic ecosystems apply to drylands, where plant N uptake and N availability are often decoupled. NO and N2O are produced during the oxidation of ammonia (i.e., nitrification) by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) or ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Because AOB may be favored in N-rich environments and may emit more NO and N2O than AOA, high atmospheric N inputs may favor both NO and N2O emissions. To assess whether atmospheric N deposition favors AOB- and AOA-derived N emissions, we selectively inhibited AOA and AOB and measured NO and N2O from soils collected from three dryland sites exposed to relatively low (3.8 kg ha(-1) = Low N) or high (11.8 kg ha(-1) = High N-A; 15.6 kg ha(-1) = High N-B) atmospheric N inputs. We found that while the High N-B deposition site had the lowest AOA:AOB ratio (2.3 +/- 0.6), consistent with expectations, this site did not emit the most NO and N2O. Rather, AOA emitted between 21 and 78% of the NO from our sites, with higher AOA-derived NO emissions from relatively coarse-textured soils in the Low N deposition site. In addition to nitrification, other processes also emitted NO and N2O, especially in the High N-A site where non-nitrifier NO and N2O emissions were similar to 2-4 x higher than the other sites, and where finer textured soils may favor denitrification. Interactions between soil texture and N availability, rather than shifts in nitrifier communities, likely determine whether atmospheric N deposition is retained in these dryland sites or reemitted to the atmosphere as NO or N2O.

AB NO2- plays a crucial role in regulating N2O formation from the soil, while how it affects the production of soil N2O is still not well understood. In this study, N2O and NO emissions from an agricultural field of the North China Plain (NCP) were comparatively investigated under live different fertilizer treatments (NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+ + NO2- and NO3- + NO2-). Additionally, soil NH4+, NO2- and NO3- concentrations and the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen cycling were also analyzed in the incubation experiment. The results showed that the N2O average fluxes from the complex treatments of NO2- + NO3- were 1.4-2.4 times the sum of those from the separate treatments of NO2- and NO3- whereas from the complex treatments of NO2- + NH4+ were a factor of 1 - 1.4 larger than those from the separate treatments of NO(2)( )(-)and NH4+, indicating the coupling interaction of NO2- with NH4+ or NO3- makes a remarkable contribution to N2O emission from the soil. Significant reduction of the activity of N2O reductase was found in the soil with the addition of NO2-, which favored the accumulation of N2O formed through nitrification of NH4+ and denitrification of NO2-, resulting in relatively high N2O emissions from the complex treatments. As the intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification, NO2- produced is also expected to interact with NH(4)( )(+)or NO3- to promote N2O emission from the soil, especially during fertilization events when NO2- is easily accumulated due to the acceleration of the nitrification and denitrification processes.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, referred to collectively as NOx, cause decreases in methane and increases in tropospheric ozone. The net negative radiative forcing that ensues is dependent on NOx flux magnitude, location and season. This study aimed to determine if urine-N rate affected NOx or nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes following dairy cattle urine application to a temperate pasture soil under summer conditions (mean monthly rainfall 45 mm; mean air temperatures 17 degrees C, range 11-22 degrees C). An in situ experiment consisting of three treatments (control, bovine urine at 543 and 1086 kg N/ha) was replicated thrice in a randomised complete block design. Soil inorganic-N, pH and gas fluxes were measured over a 72 day summer period. Fluxes of NO-N in the control, 543 and 1086 kg N/ha treatments averaged 73, 328 and 341 mu g NO-N/m(2)/h. Cumulative NO-N fluxes equalled 0.15% (+/- 0.03) and 0.20% (+/- 0.06) of the urine-N applied (+/- SD) in the 543 and 1086 kg N/ha treatments, respectively, with no effect of urine-N rate. Cumulative N2O-N fluxes did not differ with urine-N rate equalling 0.14% (+/- 0.03) and 0.16% (+/- 0.10) of the urine-N applied in the 543 and 1086 kg N/ha treatments, respectively. Under summer conditions, varying urine-N rate from 543-1086 kg N/ha had no significant effect on cumulative NO-N or N2O-N when measured over 72 days.

AB Use of nitrogen fertilizer is thought to contribute significantly to the increase of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). While the current increase of fertilizer use is concentrated in tropical areas, nearly all studies of nitrogen oxide emissions have been conducted in agricultural systems in temperate areas. We measured N2O and NO fluxes from a fertilized banana plantation in the humid tropics of Costa Rica, where 360 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) is applied. Using chamber techniques, we sampled an Andisol and an Inceptisol on a monthly basis. Twice on each soil type, we sampled intensively in time following fertilizer applications. There is a strong spatial and temporal dependence of nitrogen oxide emissions on place and time of fertilizer application. We fmd greater mean N2O and NO emissions from the Andisol (31.4 ng N2O-N cm(-2) h(-1) and 55.6 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1)) than from the Inceptisol (9.3 ng N2O-N cm(-2) h(-1) and 41.1 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1)) under the plants where fertilizer is typically applied. The percentages of applied fertilizer-N that are converted into nitrogen oxide (''yield'') are between 1.26 and 2.91% for N2O and between 5.09 and 5.66% for NO depending on soil type. We consistently calculate higher nitrogen oxide yields based on intensive sampling versus monthly sampling. Temporal variation in nitrogen oxide emissions probably causes monthly sampling to underestimate mean annual fluxes. Our results suggest that in some tropical systems a higher percentage of applied nitrogen may be lost in gaseous form than in temperate agriculture. Current global estimates of N2O and NO sources from tropical agriculture are based on information from temperate areas and may cause an underestimate of the contribution of tropical agriculture to the budgets of these trace gases.

AB Urea deep placement (UDP) has demonstrated its benefits of saving N fertilizer and increasing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and grain yields. However, studies on its environmental impacts, particularly on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), are limited. We conducted multi-location field experiments in Bangladesh to determine the effects of UDP versus broadcast prilled urea (PU) on N2O and NO emissions, NUE, and rice yields. N2O and NO emissions were measured from three N fertilizer treatments-no N, UDP, and PU-using automated gas sampling and analysis systems continuously for two rice-growing seasons-Aus (May-August) and Aman (August-December). Fertilizer-induced peaks in N2O emissions were observed after broadcast application of PU but were rarely observed after UDP. Total seasonal N2O and NO emissions, yield-scaled emissions, and fertilizer-induced emissions were affected by fertilizer treatments and sites. Though nitrogen fertilizer increased emissions significantly over the control, emissions resulting from UDP and PU were similar. Effects of N placement on grain yields and NUE were site- and season-specific. Of the N placement methods, UDP increased grain yields by 13% (p < 0.05) during the Aman season and gave similar yields in spite of lower N application during the Aus season. UDP increased N recovery from 25 and 16% of broadcast PU to 61 and 73% during the Aus and the Aman seasons, respectively in one site, but was similar in another site. On the other hand, alternate wetting and drying irrigation reduced grain yield and N recovery at the BRRI site during the Aman season.

AB On the basis of field measurements of NOx emissions from soils, we developed a statistical model to describe the influences of soil organic carbon (SOC) content, soil pH, land-cover type, climate, and nitrogen input on NOx emission. While also considering the effects of soil temperature, soil moisture change-induced pulse emission, and vegetation fire, we simulated NOx emissions from global soils at resolutions of 0.5 degrees and 6 hours. Canopy reduction was included in both data processing and flux simulation. NOx emissions were positively correlated with SOC content and negatively correlated with soil pH. Soils in dry or temperate regions had higher NOx emission potentials than soils in cold or tropical regions. Needleleaf forest and agricultural soils had high NOx emissions. The annual NOx emission from global soils was calculated to be 7.43 Tg N, decreasing to 4.97 Tg N after canopy reduction. Global averages of nitrogen fertilizer-induced emission ratios were 1.16% above soil and 0.70% above canopy. Soil moisture change-induced pulse emission contributed about 4% to global annual NOx emission, and the effect of vegetation fire on soil NOx emission was negligible.

AB Denitrification represents one of the main microbial processes producing the primary and secondary greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) in soils. It is well established that abiotic factors like the soil water content and the availability of nitrogen (N) are key parameters determining the activity of denitrifiers in soils. However, soils differing regarding their characteristics such as the content of C-org, the soil texture or the pH value may respond in specific manners to equivalent changes in soil moisture and N input. Thus, short-term incubation experiments were performed to test and compare the capacity of two contrasting Austrian forest soils to respond to mineral N application at increased soil water contents. Soils from the pristine Rothwald forest (rich in C-org) and the more acidic Schottenwald forest (poor in C-org) were amended with either NH (4) (+) -N or NO (3) (-) -N and were incubated at 40% and 70% water-filled pore space for 4 days. Changes in mineral N pools, nitrite reductase activity and NO and N2O emission rates were measured, and the abundance and structural community composition of the functional group involved in nitrite reduction were analysed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the nirK gene.
   Rapid and distinct activity responses to increased soil moisture and altered mineral nitrogen availability were observed in two contrasting forest soils. In both soils, nitrogen oxide emission rates were stimulated by N inputs and, depending on the soil moisture status, either NO or N2O emission was prevailing. However, different N cycling processes appeared to predominate in either soil under equivalent treatment. Nitrogen oxide emissions peaked following NO (3) (-) application in Schottenwald soils but were the highest after NH (4) (+) application in Rothwald soils. Denitrifying (nirK) communities differed significantly in Rothwald and Schottenwald soils; however, changes in the community structure were marginal during the short-term incubation. Abundances of nirK genes remained unaffected by N application in either soil. The soil water content affected nirK gene abundances only in Rothwald soil, indicating a distinct reaction of nitrite reducing communities in the two soils.

AB Denitrification and its products composition were evaluated in four typical Chinese paddy soils with pH (H2O) ranging from 4.80 to 8.29 after application of 50 or 100 mg kg(-1) soil (KNO3)-N-15 and subsequent anaerobic incubation. Denitrification rates, which were indicated by nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen gas (N-2) production, significantly varied among different paddy soils. The denitrification rates of the neutral and alkaline paddy soils were 2.6 to 16.6 times higher, respectively, than those of acidic paddies. Furthermore, denitrification in paddy soils could produce end products other than N-2, and the product composition depended on the paddy soil type. The percentage of total N gases (NO + N2O + N-2) present as N2O was negatively and linearly correlated with denitrification rate (P < 0.05). Soil pH and C/N showed positive effects on denitrification rate (r = 0.800 and r = 0.781, respectively, P < 0.05 for both), but negative effects on the percentage of total N gases present as N2O (r = -0.976, P < 0.01 and r = -0.781, P < 0.05, respectively). Denitrification rate and the percentage of total gases present as N2O increased as the nitrate (NO3 (-)) concentration increased. However, there was no effect of NO3 (-) concentration on the percentage of total N gases present as NO. Our results indicate that the potential N loss through denitrification may be higher in alkaline paddies than that in neutral and acidic paddies. Moreover, the variation of the N2O percentage in denitrification products of different paddy soils should be considered when estimating the denitrification-derived N2O emission and when calculating the N budget in paddy soils.

AB Annual cycles of NO, NO2 and N2O emission rates from soil were determined with high temporal resolution at a spruce (control and limed plot) and beech forest site (''Hoglwald'') in Southern Germany (Bavaria) by use of fully automated measuring systems. The fully automated measuring system used for the determination of NO and NO2 flux rates is described in detail. In addition, NO, NO2 and N2O emission rates from soils of different pine forest ecosystems of Northeastern Germany (Brandenburg) were determined during 2 measuring campaigns in 1995. Mean monthly NO and N2O emission rates (July 1994-June 1995) of the untreated spruce plot at the Hoglwald site were in the range of 20-130 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) and 3.5-16.4 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Generally, NO emission exceeded N2O emission. Liming of a spruce plot resulted in a reduction of NO emission rates (monthly means: 15-140 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)) by 25-30% as compared to the control spruce plot. On the other hand, liming of a spruce plot significantly enhanced over the entire observation period N2O emission rates (monthly means: 6.2-22.1 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)). Contrary to the spruce stand, mean monthly N2O emission rates from soil of the beech plot (range: 7.9-102 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) were generally Significantly higher than NO emission rates (range: 6.1-47.0 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)). Results obtained from measuring campaigns in three different pine forest ecosystems revealed mean N2O emission rates between 6.0 and 53.0 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and mean NO emission rates between 2.6 and 31.1 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1). The NO and N2O flux rates reported here for the different measuring sites are high compared to other reported fluxes from temperate forests. Ratios of NO/N2O emission rates were >> 1 for the spruce control and limed plot of the Hoglwald site and << 1 for the beech plot. The pine forest ecosystems showed ratios of NO/N2O emission rates of 0.9 +/- 0.4. These results indicate a strong differentiating impact of tree species on the ratio of NO to N2O emitted from soil.

AB Synthetic urine was applied at 5 rates, from 0 to 1000 kg synthetic urine-N/ha, to a pasture soil under controlled laboratory conditions. Gaseous emissions of NO(x) and NH(3) were monitored for up to 21 days following application using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry with N(2)O measured using electron-capture gas chromatography. During this period soil replicates were destructively sampled to measure changes in soil pH and inorganic-N concentrations. Comparisons were made between measured soil variables, calculated soil concentrations of NH(3(g)), HNO(2), and the measured gas fluxes. At N rates up to 500 kg N/ha, inorganic-N concentrations increased as nitrification progressed over time. With the exception of the 1000 kg N/ha treatment, NO production followed the pattern of increasing nitrification, reaching a maximum of 905 ng NO-N/cm(2).h in the 500 kg N/ha treatment 14 days after synthetic urine application. At this time the NO flux was associated best with soil pH, NH(4)(+), and NO(2)(-) levels. Over 21 days the maximum cumulative loss as NO-N and N(2)O-N occurred under the 100 kg N/ha urine treatment, with 6.6 and 6.4% of N applied lost as gas, respectively. NO(2) gas fluxes paralleled the NO emissions but were an order of magnitude smaller. Nitrification was inhibited in the 1000 kg N/ha treatment due to the sustained high ammoniacal-N and pH conditions present. These conditions prolonged the NH(3) volatilisation from this treatment. NH(3) volatilisation, as determined by selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry, was linearly related to calculated soil NH(3) gas concentrations up to 500 kg N/ha on Day 1.

AB Soil fluxes of N2O and NO were measured in a scrub grass savanna and a nearby semideciduous forest in the savanna climatic region of Venezuela, during October 1988. The forest soil produces significantly larger emissions of N2O (ranging from 5.7 to 25.0 X 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1) than the savanna soil (-3.6 to 14.0 X 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1). This suggests that "long-term" deforestation could produce a reduction of the N2O emissions to the atmosphere. In comparison with previous results from another site in the Venezuelan savanna region, very low emissions of NO, of the order of 1 to 2 X 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1, were recorded. Considering that the NO/N2O emission ratio was much lower than 1, that practically no changes in the emission were observed after the fertilization with NH4Cl, and that very low concentration of NO3- is found in the natural soil, it is likely that under undisturbed conditions N2O and NO are mainly produced by denitrification and that there is a lack of nitrifying bacteria in these soils. Both N2O and NO emissions increased after application of NaNO3. Since the emission of NO remained larger than the N2O emission (with a ratio of approximately 4/1), a significant change in the production pattern must have occurred after fertilization with nitrate.

AB NO(x) emissions from soils may contribute to the formation of O3 in rural areas, especially when there is substantial emissions of natural hydrocarbons from surrounding vegetation, such as in the southeastern United States. Soil NO(x) flux measurements were made from 6 June 1992 to 7 July 1992 in the central Piedmont region of North Carolina (Southeast Oxidants and Nitrogen intensive Analysis site, SONIA) in an effort to determine the role of natural emissions of NO(x) on rural atmospheric photochemistry. The overall average NO and NO2 emission rates, using a dynamic chamber technique, were found to be 1.79 +/- 1.37 ng-N m-2s-1 (range: 0.13 to 6.67 ng-N m-2s-1) and -1.07+/-0.87 ng-N m-2s-1 (range: -6.71 to 3.16 ng-N m-2s-1), respectively. Over 85% of the NO2 flux measurements were negative indicating net deposition to the soil surface. No negative NO flux rates were observed. NO flux was correlated with soil temperature. There was a positive correlation between NO concentration near the soil surface (approximately 50 cm) and NO flux (r = 0.35). The NO compensation point (1.12 ppbv) was estimated from the relationship between NO emission rate and ambient NO concentrations measured at 10 m. Both positive and negative vertical gradients of NO concentration between 10 m and soil surface were detected. The positive vertical gradients are indicative of NO transport to the site from polluted air masses. A significant negative correlation between NO flux and ambient O3 concentration (r=0.66), however, supports the hypothesis that soil emissions of NO contribute to local production Of O3 in rural areas.

AB We monitored soil emissions of NO, NO(2), N(2)O, and CO(2) throughout the summer dry season at a remote North American sagebrush-steppe ecosystem following application of several resources, including water, NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-) and sucrose. Despite low levels of soil NH(4)(+) (5.60 +/- 0.95 mg NH(4)(+)-N per kg soil, mean +/- S.E.), and NO(3)(-)(-)N (1.34 +/- 0.20 mg NO(3)(-)-N per kg soil), NO emissions ranged from about 0.2 to 2.8 ng NO-N m(-2) s(-1), comparable to rates measured from many agricultural, tropical, and other undisturbed ecosystems. Soil wetting increased NO emissions as much as 400-fold when initial gravimetric soil moisture contents were less than about 50 mg kg(soil)(-1) and soil temperature was greater than or equal to 20 degrees C. Wetting treatments with 20 mg NH(4)(+)-N kg(soil)(-1) raised NO emission rates to a level that was nearly an order of magnitude higher than that observed after water addition alone. Wetting treatments with 20 mg NO(3)(-)-N kg(soil)(-1), 240 mg sucrose-C kg(soil)(-1), or NO(3)(-) plus sucrose had no statistically significant effect upon NO emissions. Soil denitrifying enzyme activity was low at this site, and N(2)O emissions in the field were below detection limits. Soil nitrifying enzyme activity was extremely high at this site, indicating that the NH(4)(+) released by ammonification would be consumed at least once every 1.7 days. These observations indicate that NO emissions from this undisturbed ecosystem were likely a consequence of high nitrification activity, and that sagebrush-steppe ecosystems may be a more important NO source than has been previously assumed.

AB While it is clear that biochar can alter soil N2O emissions, data on NO impacts are scarce. Reports range from O to 67% soil NO emission reductions postbiochar amendment. We use regional air quality and health cost models to assess how these soil NO reductions could influence U.S. air quality and health costs. We find that at 67% soil NO reduction, widespread application of biochar to fertilized agricultural soils could reduce O-3 by up to 2.4 ppb and PM2.5 by up to 0.15 mu g/m(3) in some regions. Modeled biochar-mediated health benefits are up to $4.3 million/county in 2011, with impacts focused in the Midwest and Southwest. These potential air quality and health cobenefits of biochar use highlight the need for an improved understanding of biochar's impacts on soil NO emissions. The benefits reported here should be included with estimates of other biochar benefits, such as crop yield increase, soil water management, and N2O reductions.

AB Biochar (BC) application to agricultural soils has become a promising strategy for mitigation of soil-borne greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), but little is known about the effects on nitric oxide (NO) and dinitrogen (N-2) fluxes. We conducted a short-term field experiment to evaluate the effects of BC with compost and additional fertilizer on different soil GHG fluxes. Application of 1% BC-compost showed no significant effect on CH4 and CO2 fluxes but lowered NO and N2O fluxes compared to the control without BC-compost. The addition of N to BC-compost (0.5% BC-compost + 175 kg N) showed a small mitigation potential for CH4 whereas N2O and NO fluxes significantly increased for one week after the application. The N-2:N2O ratio shifted towards N2O production after the application of N-enriched BC-compost. During storage of pure N-enriched BC-compost, high gaseous losses in the form of NO (71.2 +/- 2 mu g N g(-1) h(-1)), N2O (1319 +/- 101 mu g N g(-1) h(-1)), and N-2 (337.8 +/- 93 mu g N g(-1) h(-1)) were measured. Approximately 31% of applied N was lost in gaseous form even in the presence of BC. To avoid this, an optimized strategy to balance easily available N from compost and fertilizer with the amount of BC should be developed.

AB No-till cropping can increase soil C stocks and aggregation but patterns of long-term changes in N2O emissions, soil N availability, and crop yields still need to be resolved. We measured soil C accumulation, aggregation, soil water, N2O emissions, soil inorganic N, and crop yields in till and no-till corn-soybean-wheat rotations between 1989 and 2002 in southwestern Michigan and investigated whether tillage effects varied over time or by crop. Mean annual NO3 concentrations in no-till were significantly less than in conventional till in three of six corn years and during one year of wheat production. Yields were similar in each system for all 14 years but three, during which yields were higher in no-till, indicating that lower soil NO3 concentrations did not result in lower yields. Carbon accumulated in no-till soils at a rate of 26 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over 12 years at the 0- to 5-cm soil depth. Average nitrous oxide emissions were similar in till (3.27 +/- 0.52 g N ha d(-1)) and no-till (3.63 +/- 0.53 g N ha d(-1)) systems and were sufficient to offset 56 to 61% of the reduction in CO2 equivalents associated with no-till C sequestration. After controlling for rotation and environmental effects by normalizing treatment differences between till and no-till systems we found no significant trends in soil N, N2O emissions, or yields through time. In our sandy loam soils, no-till cropping enhances C storage, aggregation, and associated environmental processes with no significant ecological or yield tradeoffs.

AB Wetlands are universally recognized as hotspots for nitrogen cycling and gaseous nitrogen emissions. In this study, the fluxes of nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ammonia (NH3), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were observed seasonally in the mud and waterfront plots of an urban wetland in eastern China using a dynamic flux chamber. The results revealed that the fluxes of NO, NO2, and NH3 displayed a diurnal pattern of higher values during the day and lower values at night, which was opposite to that of N2O. The average annual emissions of NO, NH3, and N2O were 0.16 +/- 0.04, 0.59 +/- 0.03, and 8.81 +/- 0.44 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Conversely, NO2 exhibited deposition, with an annual flux of 1.51 +/- 0.03 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Given the evolving area of urban wetlands, the emissions of gaseous nitrogen, particularly N2O, deserve substantial attention.

AB Cropland soil is an important source of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3). Chinese croplands are characterized by intensive management, but limited information is available with regard to NO emissions from croplands in China and NH3 emissions in south China. In this study, a mesocosm experiment was conducted to measure NO and NH3 emissions from a typical vegetable-land soil in the Pearl River Delta following the applications of 150 kg N ha(-1) as urea, ammonium nitrate (AN) and ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), respectively. Over the sampling period after fertilization (72 days for NO and 39 days for NH3), mean NO fluxes (+/- standard error of three replicates) in the control and urea, AN and ABC fertilized mesocosms were 10.9 +/- 0.9, 73.1 +/- 2.9, 63.9 +/- 1.8 and 66.0 +/- 4.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively; mean NH3 fluxes were 8.9 +/- 0.2, 493.6 +/- 4.4, 144.8 +/- 0.1 and 684.7 +/- 8.4 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The fertilizer-induced NO emission factors for urea, AN and ABC were 2.6 +/- 0.1%, 2.2 +/- 0.1% and 2.3 +/- 0.2%, respectively. The fertilizer-induced NH3 emission factors for the three fertilizers were 10.9 +/- 0.2%, 3.1 +/- 0.1% and 15.2 +/- 0.4%, respectively. From the perspective of air quality protection, it would be better to increase the proportion of AN application due to its lower emission factors for both NO and NH3.

AB A portion of alpine meadows has been and will continue to be cultivated due to the concurrent increasing demands for animal- and crop-oriented foods and global warming. However, it remains unclear how these long-term changes in land use will affect nitric oxide (NO) emission. At a field site with a calcareous soil on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the authors measured the year-round NO fluxes and related variables in a typically winter-grazed natural alpine meadow (NAM) and its adjacent forage oat field (FOF). The results showed that long-term plow tillage, fertilization and growing forage oats significantly yielded ca. 2.7 times more (p < 0.01) NO emissions from the FOF than the NAM (conservatively 208 vs. 56 g N/(ha.year) on average). The spring freeze-thaw period and non-growing season accounted for 17%-35% of the annual emissions, respectively. The Qio of surface soil temperature (T-s) was 8.9 in the NAM (vs. 3.8 in the FOF), indicating increases of 24%-93% in NO emissions per 1-3 degrees C increase. However, the warming-induced increases could be smaller than those due to land use change and management practices. The T-s and concentrations of ammonium, nitrate and water-extractable organic carbon jointly explained 69% of the variance in daily NO fluxes from both fields during the annual period (p < 0.001). This result indicates that temporally and/or spatially distributed NO fluxes from landscapes with calcareous soils across native alpine meadows and/or fields cultivated with forage oats can be predicted by simultaneous observations of these four soil variables.

AB Organic fertilizers may differ greatly in composition and as a result there may also be differences in nitrogen oxides emissions following their application to soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of mineral and organic N fertilizers on the nitrification and denitrification processes, and consequently on N2O and NO emissions. Therefore, a field experiment was carried out on an irrigated sandy loam soil under Mediterranean conditions during the maize (Zea mays L.) growing season. Untreated pig slurry (UPS) both with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (UPS + DCD), digested thin pig slurry fraction (DTP), composted solid fraction of slurry mixed with urea (CPS + U) and composted municipal solid waste mixed with urea (MSW + U) were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N ha(-1). Their emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment to which no nitrogen fertilization was administered (Control). Accumulated nitrous oxide losses during the crop season ranged from 6.0 to 9.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the Control and CPS + U, respectively, whereas nitric oxide losses ranged from 0.01 to 0.23 kg NO-N ha(-1), for the Control and U, respectively. The use of digested slurries mitigated N2O emission by 25% in relation to untreated pig slurry, but NO emissions were similar for both treatments. Dicyandiamide reduced N2O and NO emissions by 64 and 78% with respect to slurry without the inhibitor. An indirect effect of DCD on denitrification was also observed, with a reduction of 32% in denitrification with respect to the slurry without the inhibitor. In this case, the greatest reduction in denitrification losses occurred during the irrigation period. Composts mixed with urea reduced NO emissions by 56% (CPS + U) and 85% (MSW + U) in relation to the urea treatment, but its effect on N2O depended on the type of compost involved: CPS + U increased NO emission by 27%, whereas MSW + U reduced it by 55% in relation to urea. Denitrification was the most important process responsible for N2O emissions when organic fertilizers were applied to the soil, while nitrification was the most important for the inorganic fertilizer. The C:N ratio of fertilizers was a good predictor of their NO emissions, denitrification losses and N2O/N-2 ratio. On the other hand, added soluble N was a good predictor for cumulative N2O emissions during the period before irrigation. This work shows that an appropriate selection of organic fertilizers based on their composition could be used to mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and NO in comparison with urea.

Six treatments were applied by randomized design with three replications, which were; no N fertilizer (CK); broadcast application of urea (BC); band application of urea (B); band application of urea at a rate 20% lower than B (BL); band application of controlled-release urea (CB) and band application of controlled-release urea at a rate 20% lower than CB (CBL). The results showed that reduced application rates, applied in bands, of both urea (BL) and controlled-release urea fertilizer (CBL) produced yields that were not significantly lower than yields from the full rate of broadcast urea (BC). The emissions of N2O and NO from the reduced fertilizer treatments (BL, CBL) were lower than that of normal fertilizer rates (B, CB). N2O and NO emissions from controlled-release urea applied in band mode (CB, CBL) were less than those from urea applied in band mode (B, BL). The total emissions of N2O and NO indicated that applying fertilizers in band mode mitigated NO emission from soils, but N2O emissions from banded urea (B) were no lower than from broadcast urea (BC).

AB Soils are a major source of atmospheric NO and N(2)O. Since the soil properties that regulate the production and consumption of NO and N(2)O are still largely unknown, we studied N trace gas turnover by nitrification and denitrification in 20 soils as a function of various soil variables. Since fertilizer treatment, temperature and moisture are already known to affect N trace gas turnover, we avoided the masking effect of these soil variables by conducting the experiments in non-fertilized soils at constant temperature and moisture. In all soils nitrification was the dominant process of NO production, and in 50% of the soils nitrification was also the dominant process of N(2)O production. Factor analysis extracted three factors which together explained 71% of the variance and identified three different soil groups. Group I contained acidic soils, which showed only low rates of microbial respiration and low contents of total and inorganic nitrogen. Group II mainly contained acidic forest soils, which showed relatively high respiration rates and high contents of total N and NH(4)(+) Group III mainly contained neutral agricultural soils with high potential rates of nitrification. The soils of group I produced the lowest amounts of NO and N(2)O. The results of linear multiple regression conducted separately for each soil group explained between 44-100% of the variance. The soil variables that regulated consumption of NO, total production of NO and N(2)O, and production of NO and N(2)O by either nitrification or denitrification differed among the different soil groups. The soil pH, the contents of NH(4)(+) NO(2)(-) and NO(3)(-), the texture, and the rates of microbial respiration and nitrification were among the important variables.

AB A long-term campaign devoted to the measurement of fluxes of nitrogen oxides and ozone at the surface of a temperate deciduous forest was carried out from 1st September 2012 to 31st December 2013, using automated dynamic chambers.
   Soil temperature and water content profiles were recorded near the chambers in order to clarify the short-term response of the fluxes to these two variables.
   Bulk soil resistances against NO, NO2 and O-3 emission or deposition were also estimated in order to understand their daily and seasonal variations.
   Nitric oxide was almost exclusively emitted and the annual average soil emission of 27.4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) was higher than those for other deciduous European forests. The maximum daily peaks of NO emission exceeded 100 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) during summertime and were close to zero in wintertime.
   On annual basis the N balance of the ecosystem as NOx showed a net emission towards the atmosphere of 1.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). This result can be explained by the strong N input through wet deposition observed at this site during the last decades. NO emission fluxes depended exponentially on soil temperature and decreased at high levels of soil water content during summertime, suggesting that the main contribution was due to aerobic nitrification processes.
   Soil deposition fluxes of NO2 and O-3 were mainly governed by atmospheric processes related to the atmosphere/soil concentration differences.
   Soil resistances against NO2 and O-3 deposition showed both diurnal and seasonal variations which disagree with the constant values often used in model studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biochar amendment is commonly used to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions of agricultural soil. A new type of biochar, carbonized apple wood (CAW), was applied at different rates (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 g kg(-1)) to the soil of 2-year-old apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh. cv. Fuji) grown in pots. The variation in soil abundance of functional genes involved in microbial ammonia oxidation (Anammox and amoA) and denitrification (nirS and nirK) was determined by quantitative PCR, and the nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations in the treated soil were analysed using microelectrodes. The soil's microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus increased significantly with 5 and 10 g kg(-1) CAW application, and addition of 5-40 g kg(-1) CAW altered microbial nitrogen transformation. Furthermore, 5-40 g kg(-1) CAW application at 5-20-cm soil depth reduced NO and N2O concentrations. Redundancy analysis showed close relations between microbial functional genes and soil variables (including microbial biomass carbon, nitric oxide, nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen) after CAW application. These results indicated that microbial nitrogen transformation varied depending on the amount of CAW applied. Application of a moderate amount of CAW (i.e. 10 g kg(-1)) reduced the abundance of functional genes involved in microbial nitrogen transformation, suggesting a potential link with the observed reduction in NO and N2O concentrations in the apple root-zone soil.

AB To understand the influence of basal application of N fertilizer on nitrification potential and N2O and NO emissions, four soil samples were collected from an upland Andisol field just before (sample 1) and 4 (sample 2), 36 (sample 3) and 72 (sample 4) days after the basal application of N fertilizer during the Chinese cabbage growing season from 12 September to 30 November 2005. The potentials of N2O production and nitrification of the soils were determined using a N-15 tracer technique and the soils were incubated for 25 days at 250 degrees C and 60% water-filled pore space (WFPS). The results revealed that as much as 84-97% N2O and almost all NO were produced by nitrification. The 15 N2O emission peak occurred approximately 350 h after the beginning of incubation for samples 1 and 2, but just 48 h later in samples 3 and 4. Total (N2O)-N-15 emission during the 25-day incubation of samples 3 and 4 ranged from 190 to 198 mu g N kg(-1) soil, which was significantly higher than the 99-108 mu g N kg(-1) soil recorded in samples 1 and 2. Basal application of N fertilizer did not immediately increase the nitrification potential and the ratio of N2O to N added, but did dramatically increase the nitrification potential and the ratio of N2O to N added as ((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4 36-72 days after the basal N fertilizer was added. In contrast, NO emission was negatively correlated with nitrification potential and total N2O emission. As a result, a trade-off relationship between total NO and N2O emissions was identified. The results indicated that there was a time-lagged induction of the change of N turnover in the soil, which was possibly caused by slow population growth of the nitrifiers and/or a slow shift in the microbial community in the soil.

AB Soil and biological soil crusts can emit nitrous acid (HONO) and nitric oxide (NO). The terrestrial ground surface in arid and semiarid regions is anticipated to play an important role in the local atmospheric HONO budget, deemed to represent one of the unaccounted-for HONO sources frequently observed in field studies. In this study HONO and NO emissions from a representative variety of soil and biological soil crust samples from the Mediterranean island Cyprus were investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. A wide range of fluxes was observed, ranging from 0.6 to 264 ngm(-2) s(-1) HONO-N at optimal soil water content (20-30% of water holding capacity, WHC). Maximum NO-N fluxes at this WHC were lower (0.8-121 ngm(-2) s(-1)). The highest emissions of both reactive nitrogen species were found from bare soil, followed by light and dark cyanobacteria-dominated biological soil crusts (biocrusts), correlating well with the sample nutrient levels (nitrite and nitrate). Extrapolations of lab-based HONO emission studies agree well with the unaccounted-for HONO source derived previously for the extensive CYPHEX field campaign, i.e., emissions from soil and biocrusts may essentially close the Cyprus HONO budget.

AB Many microbial species use nitrate to support respiration under oxygen limiting conditions via the process of denitrification, which generates the gaseous products nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen (N-2). Denitrifying bacteria reduce NO to N2O, which is a potent greenhouse gas, to maintain intercellular concentrations below cytotoxic levels. The enzymes that reduce N2O to N-2 play a crucial role in restricting N2O emissions from the surface. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that accumulation of N2O results from unbalanced rates of the sequence of denitrification reactions, which is ascribed to enzyme kinetics and sequential gene expression. However, the same enzymatic regulation of N2O accumulation in soil during short periods of anoxia has not been observed in the field. Here, we investigated the role of enzymatic regulation on the accumulation of N2O during a transition from oxic to anoxic conditions that was induced by a simulated rainfall in the field. Distinct regulation regimes for activities of pre- and de novo synthesized denitrification enzymes were observed. The activity of N2O reductase played a crucial role in regulating N2O emissions. Dynamics of N2O mixing ratios in soil gas and emissions from the surface were in excellent agreement with simulations using a one-dimensional, diffusion-reaction equation with explicit representations of denitrification enzyme kinetics. A more explicit representation of the regulatory biology of denitrification in current biogeochemical models, like the approach developed in the subject study, is a promising strategy for improving predictions of episodic emissions of N2O from soil.

AB Biogenic NOx emissions from natural and anthropogenically influenced soils are currently estimated to amount to 9 Tg a(-1), hence a significant fraction of global NOx emissions (45 Tg a(-1)). During the last three decades, a large number of field measurements have been performed to quantify biogenic NO emissions. To study biogenic NO emissions as a function of soil moisture, soil temperature, and soil nutrients, several laboratory approaches have been developed to estimate local/regional NO emissions by suitable upscaling. This study presents an improved and automated laboratory dynamic chamber system (consisting of six individual soil chambers) for investigation and quantification of all quantities necessary to characterise biogenic NO release from soil (i.e. net NO release rate, NO production and consumption rate, and respective Q(10) values). In contrast to former versions of the laboratory dynamic chamber system, the four experiments for complete characterisation can now be performed on a single soil sample, whereas former studies had to be performed on four sub-samples. This study discovered that the sub-sample variability biased former measurements of net NO release rates tremendously. Furthermore, it was also shown that the previously reported variation of optimum soil moisture (i.e. where a maximum net NO release rates occur) between individual sub-samples is most likely a methodical artefact of former versions of the laboratory dynamic chamber system.

AB Nitrogen (N) fertilizer application to agricultural soils results in substantial emissions of nitric oxide (NO), a key substance in tropospheric chemistry involved in climate forcing and air pollution. However, the estimates of global cropland NO emissions remain uncertain due to a lack of information on direct NO emission factors (EF(d)s) of applied N for various cropping systems at seasonal or annual scales. Here we quantified the crop-specific seasonal and annual-scale NO EF(d)s through synthesizing 1094 measurements from 125 field-based studies worldwide. The global mean crop-specific seasonal EFd was 0.53%, with the highest for vegetables (0.75%). Among cereal crops, the EFd of maize (0.45%) or wheat (0.47%) was about three times higher than for rice (0.12%). At annual scale, the mean EFd across all cropping systems was 0.58%, with tea plantations having the highest (1.54%). For other cropping systems, the annual-scale EF(d)s ranged from 0.02% to 1.07%. Besides crop type, also soil organic carbon, total N, and pH as well as N fertilizer type were the main factors explaining the variations of NO EF(d)s. Based on obtained specific EF(d)s for each crop type, we estimated that NO emissions due to the use of synthetic fertilizers from global croplands are about 0.42-0.62 Tg N year(-1). Our budgets are relatively lower if compared to estimates derived by the use of IPCC defaults for NO emissions (0.72-1.66 Tg N year(-1)) or reported elsewhere (0.67-1.04 Tg N year(-1)). In our estimates, cash crops (vegetable, tea and orchard), which cover only 9% of the world cropland area, contributed about 31% to total NO emissions from global fertilized croplands. Overall, our meta-analysis provides improved crop-specific NO EF(d)s reflecting current stage of knowledge. The work also highlights the relative importance of cash crop production as sources for atmospheric NO, that is, agricultural systems on which mitigation efforts may focus.

AB Deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics may substantially alter soil N-oxide emissions. It is particularly relevant to accurately quantify those changes to properly account for them in a REDD+ climate change mitigation scheme that provides financial incentives to reduce the emissions. With this study we provide updated land use (LU)-based emission rates (104 studies, 392 N2O and 111 NO case studies), we determine the trend and magnitude of flux changes with land-use change (LUC) using a meta-analysis approach (44 studies, 135 N2O and 37 NO cases) and evaluate biophysical drivers of N2O and NO emissions and emission changes for the tropics.
   The average N2O and NO emissions in intact upland tropical forest amounted to 2.0 +/- 0.2 (n = 90) and 1.7 +/- 0.5 (n = 36) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In agricultural soils annual N2O emissions were exponentially related to N fertilization rates and average water-filled pore space (WFPS) whereas in non-agricultural sites a Gaussian response to WFPS fit better with the observed NO and N2O emissions. The sum of soil N2O and NO fluxes and the ratio of N2O to NO increased exponentially and significantly with increasing nitrogen availability (expressed as NO3-/[NO3- + NH4+]) and WFPS, respectively; following the conceptual Hole-In-the-Pipe model. Nitrous and nitric oxide fluxes did not increase significantly overall as a result of LUC (Hedges's d of 0.11 +/- 0.11 and 0.16 +/- 0.19, respectively), however individual LUC trajectories or practices did. Nitrous oxide fluxes increased significantly after intact upland forest conversion to croplands (Hedges's d = 0.78 +/- 0.24) and NO increased significantly following the conversion of low forest cover (secondary forest younger than 30 years, woodlands, shrublands) (Hedges's d of 0.44 +/- 0.13). Forest conversion to fertilized systems significantly and highly raised both N2O and NO emission rates (Hedges's d of 1.03 +/- 0.23 and 0.52 +/- 0.09, respectively).
   Changes in nitrogen availability and WFPS were the main factors explaining changes in N2O emissions following LUC, therefore it is important that experimental designs monitor their spatio-temporal variation. Gaps in the literature on N oxide fluxes included geographical gaps (Africa, Oceania) and LU gaps (degraded forest, wetland (notably peat) forest, oil palm plantation and soy cultivation).

AB A computer simulation model was developed for predicting trace gas emissions from agricultural ecosystems. The denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model consists of two components. The first component, consisting of the soil climate, crop growth, and decomposition submodels, predicts soil temperature, moisture, pH, Eh, and substrate concentration profiles based on ecological drivers (e.g., climate, soil, vegetation, and anthropogenic activity). The second component, consisting of the nitrification, denitrification, and fermentation submodels, predicts NH3, NO, N2O, and CH4 fluxes based on the soil environmental variables. Classical laws of physics, chemistry, or biology or empirical equations generated from laboratory observations were used in the model to parameterize each specific reaction. The entire model links trace gas emissions to basic ecological drivers. Through validation against data sets of NO, N2O, CH4, and NH3 emissions measured at four agricultural sites, the model showed its ability to capture patterns and magnitudes of trace gas emissions.

AB Tea plants prefer NH4+-N to NO3--N, and thus nitrification would be detrimental to the N uptake of tea. However, the effects of different stand ages on nitrification and nitrogen oxide (NO and N2O) emissions in tropical and subtropical regions remain unclear. We performed an incubation experiment with tea field soils from different stand ages (5, 15, and 30 years) under different water contents in subtropical (Changsha, Hunan; C5L, C15L, C30L, C5H, C15H, C30H) and tropical regions (Baisha, Hainan; B5L, B15L, B30L, B5H, B15H, B30H). The results showed that the highest net nitrification rate was in C15L and B15. The results indicated that there was more NO3--N loss in the 15-y tea field soil in both regions. The highest nitrogen oxide emissions from the subtropical and tropical plots were in C15H and B30H. Available K was the key variable for NO and N2O emissions in Changsha county, whereas SOM, pH, and available P were the key factors affecting NO and N2O emissions in Baisha county. Our findings suggest that more attention should be paid to NO3--N loss in middle-aged (10-30 years) tea fields. Similarly, the focus should be given to nitrogen oxide emissions from middle-aged tea plantations in subtropical regions and old tea plantations (>= 30 stand years) in tropical regions.

AB Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and nitric oxide (NO) are among the trace gases of concern because of their importance in global climate and atmospheric chemistry. Modeling techniques are needed for simulating the spatial and temporal dynamics of N(2)O and NO emissions from soils into the atmosphere. In this study, we modified the ecosystem model CENTURY to simulate changes in N(2)O and NO soil emissions through the process of converting tropical moist forests to pastures in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Rica. Measurements of water-filled pore space (WFPS) and fluxes of N(2)O and NO from a chronosequence of pastures were used for calibration and testing of the model. It was found that the N(2)O + NO - WFPS and N(2)O:NO - WFPS relationships as developed from primary forests could be generalized to the chronosequence of pastures and other land use systems in the region. Modeled net increases (compared to primary forests) in total N(2)O and NO production after conversion from forest to pasture were 514 kg N ha(-1) during the first 15 years under normal field conditions. The nitrogen loss in the form of N(2)O and NO during the first 15 years could range from 401 to 548 kg N ha(-1), depending on the amounts of forest residue remaining on pasture sites. N(2)O-N accounted for 90% of the gas fluxes, while NO-N accounted for 10%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the impacts of forest-pasture conversion on N(2)O and NO emissions from soil into the atmosphere were complex, depending on the initial conditions of the forest-derived pastures, management practices, soil physical and chemical conditions and their changes over time, N availability, and climate. It is therefore important to incorporate the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of those controlling factors in estimating regional and global N(2)O and NO emissions from soils into the atmosphere.

AB Both nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions are typically high in greenhouse-based high N input vegetable soils. Biochar amendment has been widely recommended for mitigating soil N2O emissions in agriculture. However, knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of fresh and aged biochar for both N2O and NO production during ammonia oxidation is lacking. Two vegetable soils with different pH values were used in aerobic incubation experiments with 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), 1-octyne and acetylene. The relative importance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) to N2O and NO production was investigated as influenced by fresh and aged biochar amendments. The results showed that AOA dominated N2O production in acidic soil, while AOB dominated N2O production in alkaline soil. Aged biochar stimulated both AOA- and AOB-derived N2O and NO production by 84.8 and 340%, respectively, in acidic soil but only increased AOA-derived N2O and NO production in alkaline soil. Fresh biochar amendment increased AOA- and AOB-derived NO in acidic soil and AOA-derived NO in alkaline soil but had negligible effects on AOA- and AOB-derived N2O in both soils. Fresh biochar decreased AOA-amoA but increased AOB-amoA gene abundances in acidic soil, whereas aged biochar increased AOA- and AOB-amoA gene abundances in both soils. These findings improved our understanding of N2O and NO production mechanisms under different biochar amendments in alkaline and acidic vegetable soils. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study we investigated possible feedbacks of predicted future climate change on forest soil NO and N2O emissions in Europe. For this we used two climate scenarios, one representing a 10-year period of present-day climate (1991-2000) and a 9-year period for future climate conditions (2031-2039). The climate scenarios were used to drive the GIS-coupled biogeochemical model Photosynthesis-Evapotranspiration-Model Denitrification-Decomposition-Model (PnET-N-DNDC), which has currently been tested for its predicting capability for soil N trace gas emissions for various sites across Europe. The model results show a complex, spatially differentiated pattern of changes in future N2O and NO emissions from the forest soils across Europe, which were driven by the combined effect of changes in precipitation and temperature. Overall, the model predicted that N2O emissions from the European forest soils will on average decrease by 6%. This decrease was mainly due to the shift in N2O:N-2 ratio driven by enhanced denitrification. NO emissions were found to increase by 9%. The increases in NO emissions were mainly due to increases in temperature. Only for the regions where soil moisture was predicted to markedly increase or suffer from water stress during the vegetation period, a reduction of NO emissions was simulated. The simulations show the possibility and feasibility for assessing climate change feedbacks on biogenic N trace gas emissions from soils at a regional scale.

AB Urea deep placement (UDP) increases nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in lowland rice fields by reducing ammonia volatilization, surface runoff and increasing nitrogen uptake. However, its effects on N losses as nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are not yet clear. We conducted field experiments at two locations of Bangladesh Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) and Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) - to determine the effects of UDP vs broadcast urea on N2O and NO emissions from rice fields.
   N2O and NO emissions were measured from three N fertilizer treatments (control [0 kg N/ha], UDP, broadcast urea) using automated gas sampling and analysis system continuously for three rice growing seasons Aus (May-Aug), Amen (Aug-Dec) and Bore (Jan-May). Urea was applied as 2-3 split application, while for UDP treatment, urea briquettes were deep placed (7-10 cm depth) between 4 hills of rice at alternate rows to meet recommended N rates in a single application. Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications and N2O and NO measurements were done at every three-hour interval.
   N2O emissions were sporadic and event specific. Peaks in N2O emissions were observed after broadcast application of urea, during dry period and after re-flooding of the dry soil. For the rest of the time during the rice-growing season, emissions were very low to negligible. However, across the rice-growing seasons, UDP significantly (P < 0.05) reduced N2O emissions compared with broadcast urea. Moreover, N2O emissions showed significant spatial and seasonal variations. They were higher during Boro season compared with Aus and Aman seasons and at BAU site than that of BRRI. Conversely, emissions between Aus and Aman seasons and between control and UDP treatments were similar. In contrast to N2O emissions, NO emissions were negligible and not affected by fertilizer treatment. However, significant spatial and seasonal variations were observed, with higher NO emissions at BRRI site compared with BAU and during Boro than that of Aus season. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Crop management-induced redox cycles lead to the formation of distinct soil layers that characterize manganese (Mn) distribution or redistribution in rice (Oryza sativaL.) based ecosystems. We studied the effect of Mn oxides on soil nitrification and N2O emissions to validate the hypothesis that Mn oxides affect the soil's nitrification and denitrification processes. Subtropical paddy soil with three different water regimes (50, 100 and 200% of soil water-holding capacity (WHC)) was treated with 3% birnessite (Mn oxide) or left untreated. The nitrification process was simulated with zero- or first-order kinetic models and N2O emissions were also measured. The maximum net rates of soil nitrification (V-a1) decreased significantly with increasing soil moisture contents (F = 184.8; P < 0.001), and so did the average net rates of soil nitrification (V-a2) (F = 6.96; P = 0.008). Manganese oxide significantly decreased V-a1 (F = 474.7; P < 0.001), whereas it had no significant effects on V-a2 (F = 0.26; P = 0.62). Manganese oxide changed the best fitting nitrification kinetic model from first- to zero-order for both 50 and 200% WHC, but it had no effect at 100% WHC. The maximum rates of emission of N2O significantly increased with increasing soil water contents (F = 15 007; P < 0.001). Manganese oxide retarded the maximum rate of N2O emission at 100% WHC, whereas it depressed the rate from 1084 to 225 g N kg(-1) day(-1) at 200% WHC (F = 7494; P < 0.001). The results indicate that the effects of Mn oxide on regulating nitrification and N2O emissions are associated with water regime-dictated redox potential, and might have important implications for regulating N cycling in rice-based ecosystems.
   Highlights
   Effect of manganese oxide on nitrification and denitrification in a paddy soil.
   Mn oxide retarded nitrification in oxic conditions and enhanced it in anoxic conditions.
   Mn oxide decreased rate of emission of nitrous oxide in anoxic conditions.
   Manganese oxide might be able to regulate N cycling in rice paddy soil.

AB Nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) are naturally produced and consumed by soil biogeochemical processes. Naturally high variation between trace gas fluxes may temporarily increase due to agricultural management. We studied spatial and temporal variability of fluxes in the context of a 3-year field experiment established to identify and quantify N2O fluxes and controlling factors using automated field measurements. We measured trace gas fluxes, soil temperature, and moisture from fertilized and unfertilized balsa (Ochroma lagopus) plantations. Combining spatial and temporal sampling we evaluate if automatically measured time series of N2O emissions are representative of overall mean fluxes from fertilized loam under balsa. Soil trace gas fluxes were measured manually at 36 randomly distributed sampling locations per plot. Mean plot emissions were evaluated against fluxes measured by seven chambers commonly used for routine bimonthly manual measurements and against N2O emissions measured by two automated chambers at 4.6-hour sampling intervals. Trace gas fluxes were highly variable over 40 x 40 m plots. Nitrogen oxide fluxes were mainly spatially independent. Fertilization increased nitrogen oxide emissions but did not introduce spatial dependency of flux data. Within about 6 weeks fluxes approached pre-fertilization level again. Given high spatial variation of nitrogen oxide fluxes we find that automatically measured N2O fluxes represent the nature of the flux response well and are in the range of fluxes indicated by spatial sampling. When soils were relatively dry fertilization inhibited CH4 uptake.

AB The magnitudes, distributions, controlling processes and uncertainties associated with North American natural emissions of oxidant precursors are reviewed. Natural emissions are responsible for a major portion of the compounds, including non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO), that determine tropospheric oxidant concentrations. Natural sources include soil microbes, vegetation, biomass burning, and lightning. These sources are strongly influenced by human activities that have led to significant changes in the magnitude and distribution of natural emissions in the past two centuries. The total NMVOC flux of about 84 x 10(12) g of carbon (Tg C) is comprised primarily of isoprene (35%), 19 other terpenoid compounds (25%) and 17 non-terpenoid compounds (40%). Vegetation is predicted to contribute about 98% of the total annual natural NMVOC emission. The estimated annual natural NO emission of 2.1 x 10(12) g of nitrogen (Tg N) from North America is primarily due to soils and lightning, while the estimated 10 Tg C of CO arises from biomass burning and vegetation. Field measurements of ambient concentrations and above canopy fluxes have validated emission estimates for a few compounds from some important landscapes. The uncertainty associated with natural emission estimates ranges from less than 50% for midday summer isoprene emission from some locations to about a factor of 10 for some compounds and landscapes.

AB Laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to study the influence of easily oxidizable C (glucose) and mineral N (NH4+ and NO3-) on NO emission, evolution of Co-2 and consumption of O-2. A flush of N2O was always observed during the first few hours after the start of soil incubation, which was significantly higher with NH4+ compared to NO3- applications. The increase in N2O emission was attributed mainly to enhanced soil respiration and subsequent O-2 limitation at the microsite level. Application of NH4+ helped to develop denitrifying populations since subsequent additions of NO3- and a C source significantly enhanced N2O emissions. In soils treated with NH4+, N2O emissions declined rapidly, which was related to decreasing concentrations of easily oxidizable C. Addition of glucose in different amounts and pre-incubation of soil for different lengths of time (to create variation in the amount of easily oxidizable C) changed the pattern of N2O emissions, which was ascribed to changes in soil respiration.

AB The use of biochar as soil improver and climate change mitigation strategy has gained much attention, although at present the effects of biochar on soil properties and greenhouse gas emissions are not completely understood. The objective of our incubation study was to investigate biochar's effect on N2O and NO emissions from an agricultural Luvisol upon fertilizer (urea, NH4Cl or KNO3) application. Seven biochar types were used, which were produced from four different feedstocks pyrolyzed at various temperatures. At the end of the experiment, after 14 days of incubation, soil nitrate concentrations were decreased upon biochar addition in all fertilizer treatments by 6-16%. Biochar application decreased both cumulative N2O (52-84%) and NO (47-67%) emissions compared to a corresponding treatment without biochar after urea and nitrate fertilizer application, and only NO emissions after ammonium application. N2O emissions were more decreased at high compared to low pyrolysis temperature.
   Several hypotheses for our observations exist, which were assessed against current literature and discussed thoroughly. In our study, the decreased N2O and NO emissions are expected to be mediated by multiple interacting phenomena such as stimulated NH3 volatilization, microbial N immobilization, non-electrostatic sorption of NH4+ and NO3-, and biochar pH effects.

AB Urea deep placement (UDP) and the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation method are two promising rice production technologies. However, studies on the impact of UDP under AWD irrigation on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions are limited. In this study, the effects of UDP with AWD irrigation on these emissions, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and rice yields are investigated, compared to conventional broadcast application. N2O and NO emissions from three fertilizer treatments - no nitrogen, UDP, and broadcast application of prilled urea (PU) - were measured. Measurements were taken using an automated gas sampling and analysis system continuously for two consecutive Boro (dry) rice seasons. N2O emission peaks were observed after broadcast application of PU but not after UDP. In contrast, large spikes in N2O emission were observed after UDP, compared to broadcast application, during dry periods. Despite differences in emission peaks, seasonal cumulative N2O emissions from UDP and broadcast treatments were similar. However, NO emissions were minimal and unaffected by UDP or AWD. UDP increased rice yields by 28% and N recovery efficiency by 167%, compared to broadcast urea. This study demonstrates that UDP with AWD irrigation can increase yields and NUE without increasing N2O and NO emissions.

   phylogenetic variation

AB Aims
   Ecological systems, especially soils, have been recently recognized as an important source of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO). However, the study on the contribution of plants to atmospheric NO budget is significantly lagged. The specific objectives of this study are to reveal the phylogenetic variation in NO emission potential existing in various plant species and find out the possible leaf traits affecting NO emission potential.
   Methods
   We measured NO emission potential, leaf N and C content, C: N ratio, specific leaf area, net photosynthetic rate (P-n) and estimated photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE) of 88 plant species. Further investigation of the relationships between NO emission potential and leaf traits were performed by simple linear regression analysis and pair-wise correlation coefficients analysis.
   Important Findings
   Major results are as follows: (1) NO emission from plant species exhibited large variations, ranging from 0 to 41.7 nmol m(-2) h(-1), and the species frequency distributions of NO emission potential could be fitted to a log-normal curve. (2) Among 88 species, NO emission potential was the highest in Podocarpus macrophyllus, but lowest in Zanthoxylum nitidum and Vernicia montana. (3) NO emission potential has strong correlation to leaf N content, P-n and PNUE. The variations in NO emission potential among diverse plant species may be closely related to leaf N level and net photosynthetic ability.

AB Soil type influences the effectiveness of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers in reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, although the effect has not been well studied. We measured N2O, NO and methane (CH4) fluxes after the application of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers and conventional fertilizer (urea) in two contrasting soils, an Andosol and a Fluvisol, in lysimeter fields. Brassica rapa var. perviridis L.H.Bailey (komatsuna) was cultivated for 1.5months in spring and in autumn. A nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), and polymer coated urea (CU) were tested in the spring and autumn experiments, respectively. In spring, DCD was effective in reducing N2O and NO emissions in the Andosol but not in the Fluvisol, compared with urea. Nitrification was likely to be a more important production process for N2O and NO in the Andosol than in the Fluvisol. This difference in N2O and NO production processes was inferred to be the main reason why DCD effectively reduced N2O and NO emissions only in the Andosol. Yield-scaled N2O emission for DCD was lower by 63% than for urea in the Andosol, but no difference was observed in the Fluvisol. In autumn in the Andosol, CU increased N2O emission compared with urea, but no difference was observed for NO emissions. In the Fluvisol, CU was not effective in reducing N2O and NO emissions. CH4 uptake from the Andosol was significantly higher than that from the Fluvisol. Fertilizer type had no effect on cumulative CH4 uptake in either soil. Our results showed that the effectiveness of DCD and CU in reducing N2O and NO emissions varied with soil because the main production processes of these gases varied with soil.

AB The semi-arid region of Chiapas is dominated by N-2-fixing shrubs, e. g., Acacia angustissima. Urea-fertilized soil samples under maize were collected from areas covered and uncovered by A. angustissima in different seasons and N2O and CO2 emissions were monitored. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of urea and of the rainy and dry season on gas emissions from semi-arid soil under laboratory conditions. Urea and soil use had no effect on CO2 production. Nitrons oxide emission from soil was three times higher in the dry than in the rainy season, while urea fertilization doubled emissions. Emissions were twice as high from soil sampled under A. angustissima canopy than from arable land, but 1.2 lower than from soil sampled outside the canopy, and five times higher from soil incubated at 40 % of the water-holding capacity (WHC) than at soil moisture content, but 15 times lower than from soil incubated at 100 WHC. It was found that the soil sampling time and water content had a significant effect on N2O emissions, while N fertilizer and sampling location were less influent.

AB Given the common problem of fertilizer overuse, agronomists are calling for a reduction of the high nitrogen dose by 1/3. We carried out a field experiment over two full winter wheat-summer maize rotations in the North China Plain (NCP) to determine whether this degree of nitrogen reduction will significantly reduce the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Three treatments were investigated in the field trial: a control with no nitrogen application, the conventional practice with nitrogen over-application and the optimal practice with a reduced dose of nitrogen by 1/3. Our observations across all treatments over the experimental period reveal significant correlations of the fluxes of either gas with soil temperature and moisture as well as the concentrations of soil ammonium, nitrate and dissolvable organic carbon. There were strong correlations within the functions of the dual Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving apparent activation energy values of 40-97 and 59-92 kJ mol(-1) for N2O and NO fluxes, respectively. Our results provide annual direct emission factors of 0.48-0.96% for N2O and 0.15-0.47% for NO and demonstrate a significant correlation between N2O emission induced by fertilization and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The correlation indicates a significant potential of N2O mitigation via enhancing NUEs. A reduction in the nitrogen dose did not obviously mitigate either the annual NO emission in both rotations or the annual N2O emission in the second one. However, nitrogen reduction significantly decreased the annual total N2O emission by 38% during the first rotation. These inconsistencies in the responses of N2O emission to the reduced nitrogen dose can be attributed to improper fertilization practices, such as broadcasting urea prior to heavy rainfalls or irrigation events during the maize season, which implies a need for further fertilization practice options/techniques in addition to the reduction of nitrogen doses.

Mean N2O emissions were 38.7 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), mean NO emissions 2.4 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1). Cumulative NO-N emissions were larger for sheep-than for cattle-grazed paddocks. Plant species composition was insignificant compared to the effect of grazers on N oxide emissions. In a controlled application experiment, plots with cattle excreta showed larger N2O emissions than plots with sheep excreta, reaching peak emissions of 1921 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) on cattle urine patches compared to 556 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) on sheep urine patches, related to different N-inputs per excretion. Peak emissions of dung-treated plots were much smaller. The N2O emission factors were 0.4% for cattle urine, 0.5% for sheep urine, 0.05% for cattle dung and 0.09% for sheep dung. N oxide emissions on the paddock scale were larger for sheep-compared to cattle-grazing, despite larger emissions per cattle excretion. We attributed this to the more even spread of sheep excreta compared to cattle excreta. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil emissions of NO and N2O from typical land uses across Lowland and Highland Scotland were simulated under climate change conditions, during a short-term laboratory study. All locations investigated were significant sources of N2O (range: 157-277 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) and low-to-moderate sources of NO emissions (range: 0.4-30.5 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)), with a general tendency to decrease with altitude and increase with fertiliser and atmospheric N inputs. Simulated climate warming and extreme events (drought, intensive rainfall) increased soil NO pulses and N2O emissions from both natural and managed ecosystems in the following order: natural Highlands < natural Lowlands < grazed grasslands < natural moorland receiving high NH3 deposition rates. Largest NO emission rates were observed from natural moorlands exposed to high NH3 deposition rates. Although soil NO emissions were much smaller (6-660 times) than those of N2O, their impact on air quality is likely to increase as combustion sources of NO (x) are declining as a result of successful mitigation. This study provides evidence of high N emission rates from natural ecosystems and calls for urgent action to improve existing national and intergovernmental inventories for NO and N2O, which at present do not fully account for emissions from natural soils receiving no direct anthropogenic N inputs.

AB Comprehensive assessment of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) budget of reduced tillage agricultural systems must consider emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CM), each of which have higher global warming potentials than carbon dioxide (CO2). Tillage intensity may also impact nitric oxide (NO) emissions, which can have various environmental and agronomic impacts. In 2003 and 2004, we used chambers to measure N2O, CM, and NO fluxes from plots that had been managed under differing tillage intensity since 1991. The effect of tillage on non-CO2 GHG emissions varied, in both magnitude and direction, depending on fertilizer practices. Emissions of N2O following broadcast urea (BU) application were higher under no till (NT) and conservation tillage (CsT) compared to conventional tillage (CT). In contrast, following anhydrous ammonia (AA) injection, N2O emissions were higher under CT and CsT compared to NT. Emissions following surface urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) application did not vary with tillage. Total growing season non-CO2 GHG emissions were equivalent to CO2 emissions of 0.15 to 1-9 Mg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) or 0.04 to 0.53 Mg soil-C ha(-1) yr-1. Emissions of N2O from AA-amended plots were two to four times greater than UAN- and BU-amended plots. Total NO + N2O losses in the UAN treatment were approximately 50% lower than AA and BU. This study demonstrates that N20 emissions can represent a substantial component of the total GHG budget of reduced tillage systems, and that interactions between fertilizer and tillage practices can be important in controlling non-CO2 GHG emissions.

AB Agricultural soils are important sources of greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as nitric oxide (NO), a precursor to tropospheric ozone. Management approaches that constrain these emissions can limit future warming and improve regional air quality, especially in high-temperature agroecosystems where soil emissions are high. Subsurface drip irrigation is a promising management solution that can limit emissions via targeted rhizosphere access to water and nitrogenous fertilizers. In complementary field studies in southern California, we compared per-yield irrigation and soil emissions in surface-and drip-irrigated field plots growing alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor ssp. Sudanese), two forage crops with differing fertilizer requirements. For each study, we monitored soil temperature, moisture, and emission responses to irrigation in both spring and summer using a custom automated chamber array that recorded measurements every 30 minutes. We found that, compared to furrow irrigation, drip irrigation in sudangrass increased hay yield by 6% and per-yield soil CO2 emissions by 9% while it decreased irrigation demand by 49%, N2O emissions by 59%, and NO by 49%. In alfalfa, drip irrigation increased yield by 7% while decreasing irrigation by 1%, per-yield soil CO2 emissions by 59%, N2O by 38%, and NO by 20%. In both crops, differences between irrigation types were strongest in summer months, when high temperatures produced large pulses of N2O and NO in sudangrass and CO2 in alfalfa following flood irrigation relative to small pulses following drip irrigation. As agriculture intensifies in warmer climates, implementation of subsurface drip irrigation can help reduce the emission of soil emissions that affect Earth's climate and regional air quality.

AB Context Overuse of N fertiliser in vegetable cropping systems is known to release of nitric and nitrous oxide to the atmosphere in China. Optimisation of N fertilisation regimes has the potential to mitigate NO and N2O emissions from these N-rich systems. Aims We investigated the effects of different N fertilisation regimes on NO and N2O emissions, and vegetable yields, with particular efforts to estimate annual direct emission factors of NO and N2O under different N fertilisation regimes in greenhouse vegetable fields. Methods Annual NO and N2O fluxes were taken simultaneously using the static chamber-based method from a greenhouse vegetable system in south-east China with four N fertiliser treatments: (1) no N fertiliser (control); (2) chemical N fertiliser application (CF); (3) organic N fertiliser application (OF); and (4) organic-chemical mixed N fertiliser application (MF). Key results N fertilisers significantly increased NO and N2O emissions. Direct emission factors of N fertiliser for NO and N2O were the largest for MF, with an average of 0.99% and 0.67%, respectively. Vegetable yields were only significantly enhanced under OF treatment. Conclusions Relative to the use of chemical N fertiliser, the application of organic-chemical mixed N fertiliser showed not to be effective for mitigating NO and N2O emissions. Instead, sole application of organic N fertiliser was a viable option to enhance vegetable yields but without increasing NO and N2O emissions in greenhouse vegetable systems. Implications Substituting the use of chemical N fertiliser with organic N fertiliser input could benefitvegetable production but without stimulating NO and N2O emissions from vegetable cropping systems in sub-tropical China.

AB In this study, we examined N gas loss as nitric oxide (NO) from N-fixing biologically crusted soils in Canyonlands National Park, Utah. We hypothesized that NO gas loss would increase with increasing N fixation potential of the biologically crusted soil. NO fluxes were measured from biologically crusted soils with three levels of N fixation potential (Scytonema-Nostoc-Collema spp. (dark) > Scytonema-Nostoc-Microcoleus spp. ( medium)> Microcoleus spp. ( light)) from soil cores and field chambers. In both cores and field chambers there was a significant effect of crust type on NO fluxes, but this was highly dependent on season. NO fluxes from field chambers increased with increasing N fixation potential of the biologically crusted soils ( dark > medium > light) in the summer months, with no differences in the spring and autumn. Soil chlorophyll a content ( an index of N fixation potential), percent N, and temperature explained 40% of the variability in NO fluxes from our field sites. Estimates of annual NO loss from dark and light crusts was 0.04 - 0.16 and 0.02 - 0.11 kg NO-N/ha/year. Overall, NO gas loss accounts for approximately 3 - 7% of the N inputs via N fixation in dark and light biologically crusted soils. Land use practices have drastically altered biological soil crusts communities over the past century. Livestock grazing and intensive recreational use of public lands has resulted in a large scale conversion of dark cyanolichen crusts to light cyanobacterial crusts. As a result, changes in biologically crusted soils in arid and semi-arid regions of the western US may subsequently impact regional NO loss.

AB Uptake rate constants for nitric oxide were measured in a neutral calcic cambisol(KBE) and an acidic luvisol (PBE). The NO uptake was higher under oxic than under anoxic incubation conditions by a factor of about three. Gassing the soils with air containing 10 ppmv NO resulted in the accumulation of nitrate which accounted for 57-94% of the NO consumed. Aerobic heterotrophic bacteria were isolated on glucose-yeast extract medium from soil dilutions corresponding to a most probable number of 10(8)-10(9) bacteria per gram dry weight soil. One of the isolates (Strain PS88, a Pseudomonas sp.) exhibited NO consumption activity that was much higher under oxic than anoxic incubation conditions, When sterile KBE amended with strain PS88 was gassed with air containing 10 ppmv NO, 88% of the consumed NO was recovered as nitrate and nitrite. A screening of various bacteria obtained from culture collections showed a widespread ability for consumption of low NO concentrations. Our results indicate that NO consumption in soil is not only possible by reductive denitrification, but also by oxidation due to aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as strain PS88.

AB irrigation management has an important influence on emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) from irrigated agricultural soils. In order to develop strategies to reduce the emission of these gases, a field experiment was carried out to compare the influence of different irrigation systems: furrow (FI) and drip-irrigation (DI), on N2O and NO emissions from a soil during the melon crop season. Two fertilizer treatments were evaluated for each irrigation regime: ammonium sulphate (AS) as a mineral N fertilizer, at a rate of 175 kg N ha(-1); and a control without any N fertilizer (Control). On plots where the AS treatment was applied, drip irrigation reduced total N2O and NO emissions (by 70% and 33% respectively) with respect to values for furrow irrigation. This was probably due to the lower amount of water applied and the different soil wetting pattern associated with DI. Dry areas of the drip-irrigated plots emitted a similar amount of N2O to the wet areas (0.45 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) in the Control and greater quantities in the AS treatment (0.92 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for dry and 0.70 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for wet areas). We suggest that the N oxide pulses observed throughout the irrigation period on DI plots could have been the result of frequent increases in the soil wetting volume after the addition of water. Denitrification losses (from depths of 0-10 cm) were estimated at 11.44 kg N2O- N ha(-1) for the AS treatment under FI and at 4.96 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for DI. Under DI, nitrification was an important source of N2O, whereas denitrification was the most important source under FI. The addition of NH and the use of DI enhanced the N2O/N-2 ratio of gases produced through denitrification. The quantity of dissolved organic C (DOC) in the soil generally decreased with addition of NH4+.
   This work showed that, in comparison with furrow irrigation, drip irrigation is a method that can be used to save water and mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and N2O. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The source strength of atmospheric trace gases from rural or remote locations must be quantified in order to assess the effect of such inputs on the background tropospheric chemistry.  To assess the importance of biological production of NO(x) and N2O from fertilized agricultural soil, enclosure techniques have been used to determine the emission fluxes of NO(x) and N2O at a site in Southern Ontario, Canada.  NO(x) fluxes on the unfertilized soil range from 1.5 to 41.6-mu-g(NO) m-2 h-1.  The corresponding N2O fluxes are 0-61.8-mu-g(N2O) m-2 h-1.  For the most highly fertilized soil NO(x) fluxes range from 3.1 to 583-mu-g(NO) m-2 h-1 and the N2O fluxes from 0 to 446-mu-g(N2O) m-2 h-1.  The fluxes increase linearly with fertilizer application, with 11% of the nitrogen in the fertilizer converted to NO(x) and 5% to N2O.  The emission rates were studied as functions of the soil parameters temperature, moisture, ammonium, nitrate and pH, to attempt to understand better the production mechanisms, although a model for the process could not be developed.  In rural areas away from transportation corridors the increased NO(x) emission from fertilized soil may dominate local oxidant production but is not significant on the Province-wide scale.

AB The possibility of NOx (NO + NO2) emissions from plants and the underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. Excess NO created possibly as a result of nitrite accumulation in plant leaves has been suggested to result in emissions. Such emission has been observed in laboratory conditions due to nitrate fertilization. In this study, we tested whether nitrate fertilization of Scots pine seedlings growing outdoors leads to accumulation of NO3- or NO2- in the needles and subsequent NOx emission.
   The experiment was done at the SMEAR II station in Southern Finland. The seedlings received nitrate or ammonium fertilizer or neither. Shoot NOx emissions were measured with dynamic chambers. Total dissolved nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, NO3-, NO2- and NH4+ concentrations in the soil and needles were determined.
   NOx fluxes from the shoots were, on average, deposition. There was no indication of fertilization-induced NO or NOx emissions. The highest NO fluxes were observed at night and were humidity-related.
   It seems unlikely that additional nitrate in the soil could cause significant NOx emission from boreal Scots pine forests in field conditions, possibly because of soil chemistry.

   PRACTICES
AB Although numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of no-tillage on carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural systems, there is still no consensus on the balance between the potential of C sequestration and nitrous oxide (N2O) or nitric oxide (NO) emissions. A no-tillage field experiment in the North China Plain was established in 2006 and the influence of no-tillage on N2O and NO emissions was monitored under an annual wheat-maize cropping system. The study included four treatments: no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) soils amended with N fertilizer at a rate of 225 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and 195 kg N ha(-1) for maize (NTN and CTN) and without N fertilizer (NT0 and CT0). Three years of no-tillage significantly (p < 0.05) increased soil organic C (SOC) content by 12.2% in the 0-5 cm soil layer, possibly due to the surface aggregation of organic C derived from crop roots and exudates, but did not alter SOC pool in the 0-30 an profile. Annual N2O emissions in the NT0 and CT0 treatments were 0.53 and 0.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively, and were significantly (p < 0.05) increased to 0.96 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in CTN and to 1.23 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in NTN. Remarkable differences in N20 emissions between CTN and NTN were observed during the maize growing season. In contrast, NO emissions were not affected by the tillage regimes regardless of N fertilization. The mean ratios of NO/N2O fluxes in N-unfertilized plots were 0.26-0.29 and 1.79-2.11 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, indicating that both NO and N2O were primarily derived from denitrification during the maize growing season and from nitrification under wheat cultivation. Under N-fertilized plots, the ratios increased to 1.44-2.02 and 5.00-6.03 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, with significantly (p < 0.05) lower values in NTN plots than in CTN plots. The N2O emission factors for N applied in the wheat-maize rotation system were 0.16% and 0.09% for NTN and CTN, respectively, which was far lower than the IPCC Tier 1 default value (1.0%), primarily due to the absence of irrigation after fertilization in maize season and low temperature in wheat season. The results suggest that the 3-year no-tillage regime with residue removal did not substantially increase C storage in the 0-30 cm profile, but stimulated N2O emissions primarily by increasing denitrification.

AB Tea gardens have been widely documented to be hotspots for nitrogen (N) oxide emissions (i.e., nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO)). However, a quantitative understanding of N oxide emissions related to different fertilizer regimes and the main controlling factors is lacking. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of 56 peer-reviewed publications on N oxide emissions from global tea gardens over the past three decades. Overall, fertilization increased N2O and NO emissions (p < 0.001) by 584 % and 790 %, respectively. The stimulating effect of fertilizer on N2O and NO emissions was mainly related to high N application rates. Furthermore, organic fertilizer treatment, combined fertilizer treatment, biochar amendment, and inhibitor amendment reduced N2O emissions (p < 0.05) by 63 %, 64 %, 69 %, and 94 %, respectively, relative to chemical fertilizer treatment. For NO emissions, only biochar amendment decreased fertilizer-driven stimulation (by 80 %, p < 0.05). Notably, the dominant factors that influenced fertilizer-induced N2O and NO emissions in tea gardens were fertilization regimes, climatic conditions, and soil properties. On a global scale, fertilization increased mean N2O and NO emissions (p < 0.05) from global tea gardens by 44.5 Gg N yr-1 and 34.3 Gg N yr-1, respectively, whereas compared with no amendment application, inhibitors reduced N2O emissions (p < 0.05) by 32.2 Gg N yr-1 and biochar reduced NO emissions (p < 0.05) by 23.6 Gg N yr-1.

AB Agricultural fields are an important anthropogenic source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Although many field studies have tested the effectiveness of possible mitigation options on N2O and NO emissions, the effectiveness of each option varies across sites due to environmental factors and field management. To combine these results and evaluate the overall effectiveness of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers [i.e., nitrification inhibitors (NIs), polymer-coated fertilizers (PCFs), and urease inhibitors (UIs)] on N2O and NO emissions, we performed a meta-analysis using field experiment data (113 datasets from 35 studies) published in peer-reviewed journals through 2008. The results indicated that NIs significantly reduced N2O emissions (mean: -38%, 95% confidential interval: -44% to -31%) compared with those of conventional fertilizers. PCFs also significantly reduced N2O emissions (-35%, -58% to -14%), whereas UIs were not effective in reducing N2O. NIs and PCFs also significantly reduced NO (-46%, -65% to -35%; -40%, -76% to -10%, respectively). The effectiveness of NIs was relatively consistent across the various types of inhibitors and land uses. However, the effect of PCFs showed contrasting results across soil and land-use type: they were significantly effective for imperfectly drained Gleysol grassland (-77%, -88% to -58%), but were ineffective for well-drained Andosol upland fields. Because available data for PCFs were dominated by certain regions and soil types, additional data are needed to evaluate their effectiveness more reliably. NIs were effective in reducing N2O emission from both chemical and organic fertilizers. Moreover, the consistent effect of NIs indicates that they are potent mitigation options for N2O and NO emissions.

AB In order to examine how fundamental soil N cycling processes are affected by elevated N inputs to temperate forest ecosystems, we made concurrent laboratory measurements of gross rates of nitrogen (N) mineralization, nitrification, nitrate (NO(3)(-)) consumption, ammonium (NH(4)(+)) immobilization, nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and nitric oxide (NO) production, and NO consumption in soils from the Harvard Forest Chronic N Amendment Study. Gross nitrification rates varied with N addition rate in a manner that was entirely consistent with patterns of NO(3)(-) leaching and NO emissions that have been previously observed in field studies. Gross nitrification was elevated above controls in soils from a pine stand receiving 5 and 15 g N m(-2) per year, and in soils from a hardwood stand receiving 15 g N m(-2) per year. Gross nitrification tended to increase with decreasing soil pH, suggesting that acid-tolerant nitrifying bacteria predominate in these soils. Different patterns of inorganic N consumption in the two stands may provide some clues to understanding the more rapid onset of N saturation that has been historically observed in the pine stand. Absolute rates of NH(4)(+) immobilization, and rates of NO(3)(-) consumption per unit of available NO(3)(-), each tended to decrease with increasing N addition in the hardwood stand, but did not vary significantly in the pine stand. Gross NO production rates increased in a manner that was consistent with nitrification rate increases, and represented up to 19% of gross nitrification. Production of N(2)O was generally less than or equal to15% of NO production and <1% of gross nitrification. Consumption of NO represented greater than or equal to96% of gross NO production and may have contributed up to 25% of total NO(3)(-) production. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB NO fluxes from soils of a periodically flooded tropical savanna in southern Africa were investigated and modeled. In the laboratory, NO production rates, NO consumption rate constants, NO mixing ratios, relationships between NO emissions and soil temperature and moisture were determined for nutrient-poor, nutrient-rich savanna soils and a floodplain soil. The NO production rate and consumption rate constants of the floodplain soil (1.96 ng N s(-1) per kilogram of soil and 2.04 x 10(-5) m(3) s(-1) per kilogram of soil, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the savanna soils (average of 1.28 ng N s(-1) per kilogram of soil and 1.47 x 10(-5) m(3) s(-1) per kilogram of soil, respectively), but there were no significant difference between the nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. NO flux rates increased exponentially with soil temperature. NO flux rates increased with soil moisture reaching a maximum near the field capacity (7.5 - 10% and 31.2% gravimetric water content for savanna and floodplain soils, respectively), after which the NO flux rate declined. These laboratory data were used in a model to estimate field NO flux rates, which were compared with actual field NO emission measurements. The NO model was modified to incorporate NO "pulsing" after the first rains of the season. Correlation between the modeled and field NO fluxes from the nutrient-poor savanna, nutrient-rich savanna, and the floodplain soils showed tau(2) values of 0.91, 0.82, and 0.74, respectively. The NO model was linked with a soil moisture and temperature model to predict annual NO emission estimates from savannas. Annual NO flux from the nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich savannas was estimated to be 0.16 x 10(-3) and 0.14 x 10(-3) kg N m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, which agree well with estimates from other savanna studies.

AB Agricultural soils may account for 10% of anthropogenic emissions of NO, a precursor of tropospheric ozone with potential impacts on air quality and global warming. However, the estimation of this biogenic source strength and its relationships to crop management is still challenging because of the spatial and temporal variability of the NO fluxes.
   Here, we present a combination of new laboratory- and field-scale methods to characterise NO emissions and single out the effects of environmental drivers.
   First, NO fluxes were continuously monitored over the growing season of a maize-cropped field located near Paris (France), using 6 automatic chambers. Mineral fertilizer nitrogen was applied from May to October 2005. An additional field experiment was carried out in October to test the effects of N fertilizer form on the NO emissions. The automatic chambers were designed to measure simultaneously the NO and N(2)O gases. Laboratory measurements were carried out in parallel using soil cores sampled at same site to test the response of NO fluxes to varying soil N-NH(4) and water contents, and temperatures. The effects of soil core thickness were also analysed.
   The highest NO fluxes occurred during the first 5 weeks following fertilizer application. The cumulative loss of NO-N over the growing season was estimated at 1.5 kg N ha(-1), i.e. 1.1% of the N fertilizer dose (140 kg N ha(-1)). All rainfall events induced NO peak fluxes, whose magnitude decreased over time in relation to the decline of soil inorganic N. In October, NO emissions were enhanced with ammonium forms of fertilizer N. Conversely, the application of nitrate-based fertilizers did not significantly increase NO emissions compared to an unfertilized control. The results of the subsequent laboratory experiments were in accordance with the field observations in magnitude and time variations. NO emissions were maximum with a water soil content of 15% (w w(-1)), and with a NH(4)-N content of 180 mg NH(4)-N kg soil(-1). The response of NO fluxes to soil temperature was fitted with two exponential functions, involving a Q(10) of 2.0 below 20 degrees C and a Q(10) of 1.4 above. Field and laboratory experiments indicated that most of the NO fluxes originated from the top 10 cm of soil. The characterisation of this layer in terms of mean temperature, NH(4) and water contents is thus paramount to explaining the variations of NO fluxes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The production of nitric oxide (NO) in forest soils can indicate that the ecosystem is progressing toward a state of nitrogen (N) saturation. Soil NO emissions may also have impacts on local tropospheric ozone (03) levels. During 2000-2001, we made first-time measurements of NO emissions in two paired watershed studies. In each study, one watershed had been amended with aerial applications of 2.5-3.5 g N m(-2) per year above background atmospheric deposition rates since 1989, and an adjacent watershed served as a reference. In plots at the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF) in West Virginia and the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM), NO emissions in N-amended watersheds (0.61-6.8 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1)) were higher than in the reference watersheds (0.21-1.4 NO-N m(-2) h(-1)). In the N-amended watershed at BBWM, NO fluxes in plots dominated by hardwood species were higher than in plots dominated by softwood species, in contrast to previous studies in other forests. Field NO fluxes were correlated with mineral soil nitrate (NO3-) Concentrations (r(2) = 0.65, P = 0.016) across all plots, suggesting that NO emissions may be a reliable indicator of NO3- leaching potential. Laboratory experiments indicated that nitrification was the dominant source of NO at both sites. At BBWM, increased NO emissions in N-amended soil appeared to result from more rapid nitrification. In contrast, reduced soil pH in N-amended soil at FEF may have caused increased protonation of nitrification-derived nitrite, and the subsequent abiotic formation of NO, even though nitrification rates were not significantly higher than in unamended soil. The results suggest that enhanced soil NO emissions are a characteristic response in forests subjected to elevated N inputs. One possible consequence of higher NO emissions is an increase in O-3-related phytotoxicity. This effect may mitigate the ability of forests to accumulate carbon in response to N inputs or increasing atmospheric CO,. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background Brachiaria humidicola (Bh) has the ability to produce biological nitrification inhibitors (NIs) and release NIs from the root to the soil. Aims To compare the effects of growing Bh with Brachiaria ruziziensis (Br, which is not able to produce NIs) on soil nitrogen (N) dynamics, N gases and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and nitrifiers and denitrifiers following sheep urine application, a laboratory incubation was conducted in a He/O-2 continuous flow denitrification system (DENIS). This incubation was conducted in the absence of light. Hence the measured effects of Bh and Br on N cycling were the residual effect of biological NIs released into the soil prior to the incubation and released via root death. Methods The treatments were: (1) Bh with water application (Bh + W); (2) Bh with sheep urine (Bh + U); (3) Br with water application (Br + W); (4) Br with sheep urine (Br + U). Results Results showed that soil NO3- concentration increased significantly in the soil with sheep urine application after the incubation. Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions increased immediately after the sheep urine application and peaked twice during the incubation. Cumulative emissions for the first peak were significantly lower from the Bh + U treatment (0.054 kg N ha(-1)) compared with the Br + U treatment (0.111 kg N ha(-1)), but no significant differences were observed in the total cumulative N2O and NO emissions between the Bh + U and Br + U treatment at the end of the incubation. Sheep urine addition did not affect the AOA, nirS and nosZ gene copies, but significantly increased the AOB gene copies after the incubation. Conclusions We conclude that the residual effect of Bh to mitigate N2O emissions in a highly nitrifying soil is short-lived.

AB We investigated changes in soil-atmosphere flux of CH4, N2O, and NO resulting from the succession of pasture to forest in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica. We studied a dozen sites intensively for over one year in order to measure rates and to understand controlling mechanisms for gas exchange. CH4 flux was controlled primarily by soil moisture content. Soil consumption of atmospheric CH4 was greatest when soils were relatively dry. Forest soils consumed CH4 while pasture soils which had poor drainage generally produced CH4. The seasonal pattern of N2O emissions from forest soils was related exponentially to soil water-filled pore space. Annual average N2O emissions correlated with soil exchangeable NO3- concentrations. Soil-atmosphere NO flux was greatest when soils were relatively dry. We found the largest NO emissions from abandoned pasture sites. Combining these data with those from another study in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica that focused on deforestation, we present a 50-year chronosequence of trace gas emissions that extends from natural conditions, through disturbance and natural recovery. The soil-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 and N2O and of NO may be restored to predisturbance rates during secondary succession. The changes in trace gas emissions following deforestation, through pasture use and secondary succession, may be explained conceptually through reference to two major controlling factors, nitrogen availability and soil-atmosphere diffusive exchange of gases as it is influenced by soil moisture content and soil compaction.

AB Application of coated nitrate fertilizers is expected to be a possible strategy to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils of croplands. To evaluate the effects of coated nitrate fertilizer application on N2O emissions from soils, N2O fluxes were measured in a carrot field from 2016 to 2017. Ammonium sulfate (AS), coated urea (CU; only in 2017), coated calcium nitrate (CC), and no-nitrogen (NN) fertilizers were investigated. No recognizable increase in N2O flux was observed for about 45 days after fertilization in all the plots in 2016. In 2017, significant simultaneous increases in N2O and nitric oxide fluxes (up to 142 and 436 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), respectively) were found only in the AS plots in spring, indicating enhancement of N2O production via nitrification. After mid-July, the N2O fluxes increased temporarily with the increase in soil water content after rainfall in all the plots including the NN plots in 2016 (up to 183-342 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and 2017 (up to 56-86 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)), indicating N2O production mainly via denitrification. Cumulative N2O emissions did not differ significantly among all the treatments in 2016, whereas that in the CC plots was significantly lower than that in the AS plots by 36% in 2017. These results suggest that the application of coated calcium nitrate fertilizers can reduce emissions of N2O produced via nitrification and can thus reduce cumulative N2O emissions in fields where nitrification is the major N2O production process in the soil.

TI Biogenic NO emissions from savanna soils as a function of fire regime,

AB A study of NOx emissions from soils representative of nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich savannas and their response to burning and soil water content was carried out in the southern Kruger National Park, South Africa. The study spanned the end of the dry season and the beginning of the wet season (September-December 1992). Nitrogen mineralization rates were measured using an in situ technique simultaneously with measurements of NOx emissions. NOx emissions were almost entirely as NO. The relationship between NO emission rate and soil moisture was parabolic regardless of soil type and management practice, with the lowest NO emission rates being measured at low (<0.087) and high (>0.542) water-filled pore space values. The initial increase in NO emission rates with increasing soil moisture are paralleled by increases in the nitrate concentration in the soil. The highest NO emission rates (20 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1)-excluding the brief initial peak) were measured on plots from which fire had been excluded for 35 years. The next highest rates (8 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1)) were measured on the more fertile soils. Infertile soils, burned every second year, had rates of 3.5 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1). The NO emission rates show a positive correlation with soil total N content and N nitrification rate. The effect of excluding fire from a savanna is to increase the soil nitrogen content through increased litter inputs, which in turn increases nitrification rates and soil NO emissions.

AB Acid forest soils in South China experience a chronically elevated input of atmospheric nitrogen (N), turning them into hot spots for gaseous N emissions. Soil moisture is known to be a major controller for the partitioning of gaseous N loss to nitric (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which may be of particular relevance in the monsoonal climate of South China. To study this partitioning in more detail, we determined gas phase kinetics of NO and N2O release during laboratory dry-out of acidic surface soils from the headwater catchment TieShanPing (TSP), situated close to Chongqing, SW China. Soils were sampled from two hydrologically distinct environments, a well-drained hill slope (HS), and a periodically flooded groundwater discharge zone (GDZ). Production and consumption of NO were studied in an automated flow-through system purged with NO-free or NO-spiked air. Production rates peaked at 21% and 18% water filled pore space (WFPS) in HS and GDZ soils, respectively, suggesting nitrification as the dominant process of NO formation in both landscape units. In HS soils, maximum production and consumption occurred at the same WFPS, whereas GDZ soils displayed maximum NO consumption at higher WFPS than maximum production, suggesting that denitrification is an important NO sink in GDZ soils. Net N2O release was largest at 100% WFPS and declined steadily during drying. Integrated over the entire range of soil moisture, potential NO-N loss outweighed potential N2O-N loss, suggesting that N-saturated, acid forest soil is an important NO source.

AB Rationale Acidic subtropical forest soils that receive high atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition have been identified as important sources of nitric oxide (NO). The relative importance of major processes producing NO is unclear.
   Methods To partition NO sources, we conducted an in situ tracing experiment with (NH4NO3)-N-15 and (NH4NO3)-N-15 in well-drained acid soils of an N-saturated subtropical forest in Chongqing, southwest China.
   Results In the (NH4NO3)-N-15 treatment, the N-15 signature of NO emitted from the foot of the hillslope (Lower site) was similar to that of the NH4+ pool, indicating predominant autotrophic nitrification for NO formation. In the (NH4NO3)-N-15 treatment, the N-15 enrichment of NO was smaller than that of the NO3- pool, suggesting minor contribution of denitrification to NO production (15%).
   Conclusions Nitrification is the main process responsible for NO emissions, even in monsoonal summers when soil water-filled pore space values are relatively high.

AB Tropical ecosystems play an important role in production or consumption of atmospheric trace gases including nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4). Here we describe field and laboratory experiments, performed during 1994, to determine the influence of fire on processes responsible for fluxes of gases from cerrado sites burned 17 and 45 d earlier, and a control site, last burned in 1974. Burning stimulated gross N mineralization but depressed nitrification rates; however, rates were sufficient to support NO fluxes observed in a 1992 study at the same site. Extractable nutrients and fluxes of NO and N2O from wetted and dry soils were measured prior to and for a 3-d period following burning. Over this period NO2- declined to undetectable levels; NH4+ increased, and NO fluxes remained relatively constant, suggesting that nitrifiers replaced the NO2- reduced to NO. Soils at burned and unburned sites exhibited CH4 uptake, which was inhibited by CH3F, thereby converting soils from a strong sink to a weak source of CH4. Carbon dioxide fluxes did not increase, and there were no detectable fluxes of N2O following burning. In lab studies NO and N2O emissions were inhibited by autoclaving, suggesting that nitrification was key to their production. However, addition of NO2- to autoclaved soil resulted in large fluxes of NO but no detectable N2O, suggesting that chemodenitrification may have been responsible for NO but not N2O production. Further research is needed to determine whether NO is produced directly by nitrifier NO2- reduction or indirectly by chemodenitrification of NO2- produced by nitrifiers.

AB Previous studies have demonstrated that denitrification rates are low in subtropical forest soils. However, the mechanisms governing this process are not well known. This study seeks to identify the mechanisms responsible for the low denitrification capacity and high nitrogen oxide gas ratio in subtropical forest soils in China. The denitrification capacity and nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen (N-2) emission rates were measured using the acetylene inhibition method under conditions of added nitrate and anoxia. The abundance of nitrate reductase (narG), nitrite reductase (nirK), nitric oxide reductase (cnorB), and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) was measured using real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of the nirK and norB products was performed to analyze the population structure of denitrifying bacteria. These results showed that the denitrification capacity in subtropical forest soils was lower than in temperate forest soils (p<0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that redox potential at the start of incubation (Eh(i)), rather than soil pH or soil organic C, was the key soil variable influencing denitrification, and Eh(i) alone could explain 68% of the variations in denitrification capacity. The high Eh(i) in subtropical soils led to a low abundance of nirK and significant differences in the population structure of denitrifying bacteria between subtropical and temperate soils. Therefore, Eh(i) was responsible for the low denitrification capacity in subtropical forest soils. The ratio of NO to total denitrification gas products (p<0.01) and the ratio of NO and N2O to total denitrification gas products (p<0.05) were significantly higher in subtropical forest soils than in temperate forest soils, while the reverse trend was observed for the ratio of N-2 to total denitrification gas products (p<0.05). A high Eh(i) reduced the specific reduction activity of each nosZ copy and, in turn, resulted in a large ratio of NO and N2O to total denitrification gas products in subtropical soils. Thus, NO and N2O, but not N-2, were the dominant denitrification gas products, accounting for 80%, even under the highly anaerobic conditions in subtropical forest soils and despite low denitrification capacity. These results were significant for understanding the Hole in the Pipe model and NO and N2O gases emission in subtropical forest soils. Despite the fact that the nitrogen flowing through the pipe (denitrification capacity) was low, the large holes in the pipe resulted in a large quantity of NO and N2O gases leaking out. This leakage may be a potential mechanism for the high levels of NO and N2O gas emission in subtropical forest soils and could partly explain why NO and N2O emissions are generally high in subtropical and tropical soils.

AB N2O, NO, NO2, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were measured simultaneously from tilled and compacted soil in a factorial design to investigate the effect of management on trace gas emissions. Six treatments in combinations of with and without N application, tillage and compaction were investigated for a period of 3 weeks using the closed-chamber technique (for N2O, CO2 and CH4) and the open-chamber technique (for NO and NO2). Total NO emissions from the tilled plots were 2.4 times greater than from the non-tilled plots, whereas CO2 emissions were 1.8 times greater from the non-tilled plots. Compaction increased the emissions of N2O and CH4 3.5- and 4.4-fold, respectively, compared with emissions from uncompacted plots. The effects of tillage and compaction on the gaseous emissions are discussed in relation to their production, transport and lifetime within the soil. The results showed that the best option for reducing gaseous emission from fertilised soil, with regards to tillage or compaction, would be the least compacted system, regardless of the tillage status as reflected, at least in the short term, by minimal emissions of N2O and CH4 and to some extent those of NO, NO2 and CO2.

AB Natural emissions play a key role in modulating the formation of ground-level ozone (O-3), especially emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and soil nitric oxide (SNO), and their individual effects on O-3 formation have been previously quantified and evaluated. However, their synergistic effects remain unclear and have not yet been well assessed. By applying the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Chemistry Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (WRF/Chem-MEGAN) model, this study reveals that in the presence of sufficient BVOC emissions, which act as a fuel, SNO emissions act as a fuel additive and promote the chemical reactions of BVOCs and the subsequent production of O-3. Consequently, the synergistic effects of BVOC and SNO emissions on summertime O-3 production surpassed the sum of their individual effects by as much as 10-20 mu g m(-3) in eastern China in 2014. In order to reduce O-3 concentration to a level corresponding to no natural emissions of BVOC or SNO (i.e., the BASE scenario), the anthropogenic volatile organic compound (AVOC) emissions in the scenario considers BVOC and SNO emissions must be reduced by 1.76 times that of the BASE scenario. This study demonstrates that the synergistic effects of BVOC and SNO emissions can impede ground-level O-3 regulation and can subsequently impose stricter requirements on anthropogenic precursor emission control in China. The results of this study can also inform efforts in other regions that are still combating ground-level O-3 pollution.

AB The acetylene inhibition technique (AIT) is the most widely used indirect method of determining denitrification fluxes. Although AIT bias has long been recognised, the contributions of soil denitrification-related parameters to this bias have not yet been well quantified. Using a direct-N-2 method as a baseline, we determined the composition of AIT bias and quantified the effects of soil nitrate (NO3-) and water contents on AIT bias under an aerobic atmosphere. The results showed that the AIT severely underestimated the denitrification rate by 5-26 times and failed to capture the dynamic of denitrification with increasing soil water content. The bias increased with increases in the soil NO3- and water contents. Acetylene-catalysed nitric oxide (NO) oxidation accounted on average for 60% (ranging from 31 to 79%) of the bias. The remaining bias was caused by incomplete acetylene inhibition of nitrous oxide (N2O) reduction. Our results indicate that the AIT method is not recommended for denitrification determination under an aerobic atmosphere, especially for soils with high NO3- and water contents.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), denitrification losses and NO3 leaching from an irrigated sward were quantified under Mediterranean conditions. The effect of injected pig slurry (IPS) with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) was evaluated and also compared with that of a surface pig slurry application (SPS) and a control treatment (Control) without fertiliser. After application, fluxes of NO and N2O peaked from SPS (3.06 mg NO-N m(-2) d(-1) and 108 mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)) and IPS (3.50 mg NO-N m(-2) d(-1) and 105 mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)). However, when irrigation was applied, N2O and NO emissions declined. The total N2O and denitrification losses were slightly large from IPS than from SPS, although the differences were not significant (P < 0.05). Emission of NO was not affected by the method of pig slurry application. DCD inhibited nitrification during the first 20-30 days and reduced N2O and NO emissions from pig slurry by at least 46% and 37%, respectively. Considering the 215 days following pig slurry application, the emission factor of N2O based on N fertiliser was 1.60% (SPS), 2.95% (IPS), and 0.50% (IPS + DCD). The emission factor for NO was 0.14% (SPS), 0.12% (IPS), and 0.02% (IPS + DCD). Environmental conditions of the crop favoured the denitrification process as the most important source of N2O during the experimental period. The differences in the denitrification rate between treatments could be explained by the pattern of water soluble carbon (WSC), that was the highest value in injected pig slurry (with and without DCD). Due to low drainage (5% of water applied), leaching losses of NO3 were lower than those of denitrification from the upper soil layer (0-10 cm) in all treatments and especially with IPS + DCD, where the nitrification inhibitor was very efficient in reducing leaching losses.

AB The effect of glucose addition (0 and 500 mu g C g(-1) soil) and nitrate (NO(3)) addition (0, 10, 50 and 500 mu g NO(3)-N g(-1) soil) on nitric oxide reductase (cnorB) gene abundance and mRNA levels, and cumulative denitrification were quantified over 48 h in anoxic soils inoculated with Pseudomonas mandelii. Addition of glucose-C significantly increased cnorB (p) (P. mandelii and related species) mRNA levels and abundance compared with soil with no glucose added, averaged over time and NO(3) addition treatments. Without glucose addition, cnorB (p) mRNA levels were higher when 500 mu g NO(3)-N g(-1) soil was added compared with other NO(3) additions. In treatments with glucose added, addition of 50 mu g NO(3)-N g(-1) soil resulted in higher cnorB (p) mRNA levels than soil without NO(3) but was not different from the 10 and 500 mu g NO(3)-N g(-1) treatments. cnorB (p) abundance in soils without glucose addition was significantly higher in soils with 500 mu g NO(3)-N g(-1) soil compared to lower N-treated soils. Conversely, addition of 500 mu g NO(3)-N g(-1) soil resulted in lower cnorB (p) abundance compared with soil without N-addition. Over 48 h, cumulative denitrification in soils with 500 mu g glucose-C g(-1) soil, and 50 or 500 mu g NO(3)-N g(-1) was higher than all other treatments. There was a positive correlation between cnorB (p) abundance and cumulative denitrification, but only in soils without glucose addition. Glucose-treated soils generally had higher cnorB (p) abundance and mRNA levels than soils without glucose added, however response of cnorB (p) abundance and mRNA levels to NO(3) supply depended on carbon availability.

AB To develop an advanced method for estimating nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emission from an agricultural watershed, we used a closed-chamber technique to measure seasonal N(2)O and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes in cornfields, grassland, pastures and forests at the Shizunai Experimental Livestock Farm (467 ha) in southern Hokkaido, Japan. From 2000 to 2004, N(2)O and NO fluxes ranged from -137 to 8,920 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) and from -12.1 to 185 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Most N(2)O/NO ratios calculated on the basis of these N(2)O and NO fluxes ranged between I and 100, and the log-normal N(2)O/NO ratio was positively correlated with the log-normal N(2)O fluxes (r(2) = 0.346, P < 0.01). These high N(2)O fluxes, therefore, resulted from increased denitrification activity. Annual N(2)O emission rates ranged from -1.0 to 81 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (average = 6.6 kg N ha(-1)). As these emission values varied greatly and included extremely high values, we divided them into two groups: normal values (i.e. values lower than the overall average) and high values (i.e. values higher than average). The normal data were significantly positively correlated with N input (r(2) = 0.61, P < 0.01) and the "higher" data from ungrazed fields were significantly positively correlated with N surplus (r(2) = 0.96, P < 0.05). The calculated probability that a high N(2)O flux would occur was weakly and positively correlated with precipitation from May to August. This probability can be used to represent annual variation in N(2)O emission rates and to reduce the uncertainty in N(2)O estimation.

AB Urea deep placement (UDP) increases nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and crop yields while reducing nitrogen (N) losses to the environment. However, studies on its environmental impacts on nitric oxide (NO) emissions are still limited. Therefore, we conducted a greenhouse experiment to quantify the NO emissions from a rice-wheat system. NO emissions were measured from three N fertilizer treatments - control (no N), UDP, and broadcast prilled urea (PU) - using an automated gas sampling and analysis system continuously for a rice-wheat cropping cycle. In rice, UDP was tested under two water regimes - continuous flooding (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). Fertilizer treatments had significant effects (p <0.05) on NO emissions. UDP with AWD irrigation increased NO emissions (3.41 gN ha(-1)) (p < 0.05) by 2.5-times compared to UDP with CF (1.35 g N ha(-1)). But emissions were similar between UDP and broadcast PU under the CF water regime. In wheat, the application of N fertilizer - regardless of application methods - increased NO emissions (615 g N ha(-1), average across application methods) by 10-times over control (62.52 g N ha(-1)). However, emissions were not significantly (P> 0.05) different among the treatments. Fertilizer induced emission factors (EFs) were not affected by N placement methods in either rice or wheat. On average, EFs in the rice were very low (<0.002%) compared to the wheat (0.5%). This study reveals that (regardless of treatments), the contribution of rice (<4 g N ha(-1)) on total annual NO emissions (433 g N ha(-1)) was very small (<0.5%) compared to emissions from wheat.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) reacts with hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of sunlight to form ozone in the lower atmosphere. Tropospheric ozone can be harmful to plants and animals, and is usually regarded as a symptom of industrial or vehicular pollution. The cloud of tropospheric ozone which forms over southern Africa every spring probably has its main origin in natural emissions of the ozone-forming trace gases, including CO from vegetation fires, emissions of NO from soils, and hydrocarbons from plants. The observed levels of ozone are not dangerous to humans, but form a high background level to which pollutants of human origin are added.

AB Fertilized cropping systems are important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) to the atmosphere, and biotic and abiotic processes control the production and consumption of these gases in the soil. In fact, the inhibition of nitrification after application of urea or an ammonium-based fertilizer to agricultural soils has resulted in an efficient strategy to mitigate both N2O and NO in aerated agricultural soils. Therefore, the NO and N2O mitigation capacity of a novel nitrification inhibitor (NI), 2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA), has been studied in a winter wheat crop. A high temporal resolution of fluxes of NO and NO2, obtained by using automatic chambers for urea (U) and urea with DMPSA, allowed a better understanding of the temporal net emissions of these gases under field conditions. Seventy-five days after fertilization, the effective reduction of nitrification by DMPSA significantly decreased the production of NO with respect to the treatment without it, giving net consumption of NO in the soil (-61.72 g-N ha(-1)) for U DMPSA in comparison to net production (227.44 g-N ha(-1)) for U. The explanation of NO deposition after NI application, due to biotic and abiotic processes in the soil-plant system, supposes a challenge that needs to be studied in the future. In the case of N2O, the addition of DMPSA significantly mitigated the emissions of this gas by 71%, though the total N2O emissions in both fertilized treatments were significantly greater than those of the control (43.69 g-N ha(-1)). Regarding the fertilized treatments, no significant effect of DMPSA in comparison to urea alone was observed on grain yield nor bread-making wheat quality. To sum up, we got a significant reduction of N2O and NO with the addition of DMPSA, without a loss in yield and quality parameters in wheat. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB An incubation experiment was conducted to examine the effects of phosphorus (P) addition with and without ammonium, nitrate, or glucose on N2O and NO emissions from soil taken under Acacia mangium plantation and incubated at 100 % water-filled pore space (WFPS). Additions of NO (3) (-) stimulated the N2O and NO emissions while NH (4) (+) did not, showing that denitrification was the main process of N2O and NO production in the study condition. When NO (3) (-) was added with P significantly (P < 0.05) increased N2O emissions regardless of the ratio of the added nitrogen and carbon, suggesting that P addition stimulated denitrification activity. The activation of denitrification by P addition is possibly attributed to two mechanisms: (1) the added-P stimulated denitrification by relieving P shortage for denitrifying bacteria and (2) the added-P stimulated activity of heterotrophic soil microflora with increased O-2 consumption promoting the development of anaerobic conditions with stimulation of denitrification.

AB To predict emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) from forest soils, we have developed a process-oriented model by integrating several new features with three existing models, PnET, Denitriftcation-Decomposition (DNDC), and a nitrification model. In the new model, two components were established to predict (1) the effects of ecological drivers (e.g., climate, soil, vegetation, and anthropogenic activity) on soil environmental factors (e.g., temperature, moisture, pH, redox potential, and substrates concentrations), and (2) effects of the soil environmental factors on the biochemical or geochemical reactions which govern NO and N2O production and consumption. The first component consists of three submodels for predicting soil climate, forest growth, and turnover of soil organic matter. The second component contains two submodels for nitrification and denitrification. A kinetic scheme, a so-called "anaerobic balloon," was developed to calculate the anaerobic status of the soil and divide the soil into aerobic and anaerobic fractions. Nitrification is only allowed to occur in the aerobic fraction, while denitrification occurs only in the anaerobic fraction. The size of the anaerobic balloon is defined by the simulated oxygen partial pressure which is calculated based on oxygen diffusion and consumption rates in the soil. As the balloon swells or shrinks, the model dynamically allocates substrates (e.g., dissolved organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate, etc.) into the aerobic and anaerobic fractions. With this approach, the model is able to predict both nitrification and denitrification in the same soil at the same time. This feature is important for soils where aerobic and anaerobic microsites often exist simultaneously. With the kinetic framework as well as its interacting functions, the PnET-N-DNDC model links ecological drivers to trace gas emissions. Tests for validating the new model are published in a companion paper [Stange er al., this issue].

AB Changes in land use and management of tropical systems are considered to be major factors in the recent upsurge in increases in atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Studies were initiated in western Puerto Rico grasslands to determine the effect of plowing, or liming and fertilizing an acid Oxisol on the soil-atmosphere exchanges of N2O and CH4. Weekly field flux measurements and field manipulation and laboratory studies were conducted over 22 months during 1993-1995. We found that N2O emissions from an Oxisol acidified to pH 4 were generally lower than from pH 6 Oxisol soils that were used as reference controls. Plowing the grasslands did not change mean N2O emission rates from either pH soil. Liming the acidified Oxisol to pH 6 tended to increase N2O emissions to the rates from the undisturbed grassland. Fertilizing the acidified grassland increased N2O emissions but much less than when these soils were both limed and fertilized. Short-term held studies employing nitrification inhibitors in which we measured nitric oxide (NO) and N2O, emissions, demonstrated that nitrification rates generally control N2O emissions; thus these were lower in unlimed soil. It is likely that NO was produced through the chemical decomposition of nitrite, which in turn, was a product of biological nitrification. Soil consumption of atmospheric CH4 in the acidified Oxisol was about one-fourth of that in the pH 6 reference soil. Liming did not restore CH4 consumption in the acid soil to rates comparable to those in the reference Oxisol. We conducted a laboratory induction study to determine if incubation of these limed or unlimed acidified soils with high concentrations of CH4 could induce methanotrophic activity. Comparable uptake rates to the control soils were not induced by these incubations. These studies illustrate that management of soil can considerably affect the soil-atmosphere exchange of such trace gases as N2O and CH4 which can affect global atmospheric properties.

AB Nitrite (NO2-) accumulation in soil following nitrogen (N) fertilizer application has been observed under a variety of conditions. The presence of NO2- together with soil acidity results in the formation of nitrous acid (HNO2), which decomposes abiotically to produce nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). These N oxide trace gases have potential effects on several atmospheric processes. Presented here is a model that describes some of the interactions between microbial, chemical, and physical processes that influence NO2- accumulation and N oxide gas emissions following applications of NH4+-based fertilizers. The model is applied to hypothetical, and actual field scenarios. A two-step, two-population nitrification submodel is linked to gas production and transformation submodels. Transport of all chemical species occurs by diffusion. The model results suggest that some degree of transient nitrite accumulation following NH4+ application is a consequence of the nature of nitrification itself. Model simulations and sensitivity analysis indicate that (i) soils receiving similar fertilizer treatments but differing in their ability to buffer nitrification-induced acidity may produce dramatically different N oxide gas emissions, (ii) subsurface fertilizer placement can significantly reduce net NO emissions, and (iii) the differential responses of Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter populations to chemical toxicities associated with the form and/or rate of fertilizer application may significantly affect the extent of NO2- accumulation and corresponding gas emissions. Overall, the results contribute to our basic understanding of how multiple microbial, chemical, and physical factors can interact to control the net soil-to-atmosphere emission of nitrification-derived NO and N2O.

AB The emission of nitric oxide (NO) by soils (SNOx) is an important source of oxides of nitrogen (NOx=NO+NO2) in the troposphere, with estimates ranging from 4 to 21 Tg of nitrogen per year. Previous studies have examined the influence of SNOx on ozone (O-3) chemistry. We employ the ECHAM5/MESSy atmospheric chemistry model (EMAC) to go further in the reaction chain and investigate the influence of SNOx on lower tropospheric NOx, O-3, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), nitric acid (HNO3), the hydroxyl radical (OH) and the lifetime of methane (tau(CH4)). We show that SNOx is responsible for a significant contribution to the NOx mixing ratio in many regions, especially in the tropics. Furthermore, the concentration of OH is substantially increased due to SNOx, resulting in an enhanced oxidizing efficiency of the global troposphere, reflected in a similar to 10% decrease in tau(CH4) due to soil NO emissions. On the other hand, in some regions SNOx has a negative feedback on the lifetime of NOx through O-3 and OH, which results in regional increases in the mixing ratio of NOx despite lower total emissions in a simulation without SNOx. In a sensitivity simulation in which we reduce the other surface NOx emissions by the same amount as SNOx, we find that they have a much weaker impact on OH and tau(CH4) and do not result in an increase in the NOx mixing ratio anywhere.

The average of measured fluxes was 4.8 ng N cm(-2)h(-1) (n=131). Emission rates increased by an order of magnitude during and after rainfall, and a mean flux from this environment, weighted for mean weather conditions, was estimated as 3.6 ng N cm(-2)h(-1).

AB We studied nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions every growing season (April to October) for 6 years (1995similar to2000), in a Gray Lowland soil cultivated with onions in central Hokkaido, Japan. Emission of N2O from the onion field ranged from 0.00 to 1.86 mgN m(-2) h(-1). The seasonal pattern of N2O emission was the same for 6 years. The largest N2O emissions appeared near harvesting in August to October, and not, as might be expected, just after fertilization in May. The seasonal patterns of soil nitrate (NO3-) and, ammonium (NH4+) levels and the ratio of N2O to NO emission indicated that the main process of N2O production after fertilization was nitrification, and the main process of N2O production around harvest time was denitrification. N2O emission was strongly influenced by the drying-wetting process of the soil, as well as by the high soil water content. The annual N2O emission during the growing season ranged from 3.5 to 15.6 kgN ha(-1). The annual nitrogen loss by N2O emission as a percentage of fertilizer-N ranged from 1.1 to 6.4%. About 70% of the annual N2O emission occurred near harvesting in August to October, and less than 20% occurred just after fertilization in May to July. High N2O fluxes around the harvesting stage and a high proportion of N2O emission to total fertilizer-N appeared to be probably a characteristic of the study area located in central Hokkaido, Japan.

AB Research on soil N loss mechanisms remains a high priority not only because of the need to increase agricultural N use efficiency, but also because of environmental concerns such as NO3- contamination of groundwater and increasing N oxide concentrations in the atmosphere. We measured NO and N2O emissions and downward movement of NO3- in an eastern Colorado corn (Zea mays L.) field irrigated with a modified center-pivot system that applied water to alternate furrows. One hour after infiltration of the irrigation water, emission rates measured by an enclosure method ranged from 0 to 6 g N ha-1 d-1 for NO and 0 to 26 g N ha-1 d-1 for NA The emission rates were largest after the first irrigation and much smaller following subsequent irrigations. Greater N oxide evolution from nonirrigated furrows than adjacent irrigated furrows probably resulted from lateral transport of gases produced in the wet soil. Analyses of soil cores taken after planting and after harvest provided no evidence that NO3- moved below the root zone during the growing season, despite the presence of substantially more inorganic N than required for maximum corn yield. These data suggest that when the size and frequency of irrigations are efficiently managed, use of a low energy precision application (LEPA) irrigation system results in no N loss to groundwater and no economically significant gaseous N oxide loss to the atmosphere.

AB Nitrite (NO2-) accumulation and associated production of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases in soils amended with nitrogen (N) fertilizers are well documented, but there remains a poor understanding of their regulation and variation among soil types. We examined responses to urea inputs in two soils at five temperatures from 5 to 30 degrees C and developed a process-driven model to describe the dynamics. A microcosm system was used to measure ammonia gas (NH3), ammonium (NH4+), NO2-, nitrate (NO3-), NO, N2O and pH over 12 weeks. Unexpectedly, NO2-, NO and N2O production tended to increase as soil temperature declined in both soils. The maximum NO2- concentration, or compensation point (CP), differed by soil type but the time required to reach CP decreased exponentially with increasing temperature in both soils. A two-step nitrification model ('2SN') accounted for interactions of ammonia-oxidation (AmO), nitrite oxidation (NiO), urea hydrolysis, NH4- sorption, N gas production and pH dynamics. Both steps of nitrification (AmO and NiO) were modeled using NH3 inhibition kinetics. The model adequately simulated the observed dynamics and temperature responses and showed that increased uncoupling of AmO and NiO at colder temperatures resulted from their differential temperature responses. The dynamics observed here may be important following high-rate and banded N fertilizer applications and in ruminant urine patches. The results may help explain elevated N2O emissions observed under cold temperatures. The 2SN model can account for interactions among multiple processes and may be useful for studying the effects of management practices and climate factors, including climate change scenarios, on soil N cycling.

AB In recent years, concern has grown over the contribution of nitrogen (N) fertilizer use to nitrate (NO3-) water pollution and nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide ( NO), and ammonia (NH3) atmospheric pollution. Characterizing soil N effluxes is essential in developing a strategy to mitigate N leaching and emissions to the atmosphere. In this paper, a previously described and tested mechanistic N cycle model (TOUGHREACT-N) was successfully tested against additional observations of soil pH and N2O emissions after fertilization and irrigation and before plant emergence. We used TOUGHREACT-N to explain the significantly different N gas emissions and nitrate leaching rates resulting from the different N fertilizer types, application methods, and soil properties. The N2O emissions from NH4+-N fertilizer were higher than from urea and NO3--N fertilizers in coarse-textured soils. This difference increased with decreases in fertilization application rate and increases in soil buffering capacity. In contrast to methods used to estimate global terrestrial gas emissions, we found strongly nonlinear N2O emissions as a function of fertilizer application rate and soil calcite content. Speciation of predicted gas N flux into N2O and N-2 depended on pH, fertilizer form, and soil properties. Our results highlighted the need to derive emission and leaching factors that account for fertilizer type, application method, and soil properties.

AB The photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) is an important source of OH radical, the key oxidizing agent in the atmosphere. Recently it has been reported that nitrite (NO2-) in boil can also be a source of atmospheric HONO, in addition to the other pathways, e.g. the hydrolysis of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on wet surfaces. However, the production rates of MONO in various soils are unknown. We selected a range of dominant northern acidic soils and showed in microcosm experiments that soils which have the highest nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions (drained peatlands) also have the highest MONO production rates. It is known that in natural peatlands with high water table and in boreal coniferous forest soils, low nitrification activity (microbial production of nitrite and nitrate) limits their N2O production. Low availability of nitrite in these soils is the likely reason also for their low MONO production rates. Lowering of water table of peatlands as a result of drainage or climate change enhances their nitrification activity and N2O/NO production and as shown here also their HONO production. Also nitrogen deposition, or nitrogen fertilization and other land-use practices increasing availability of mineral nitrogen can be expected to enhance HONO emissions from soils.

AB Despite the importance of anhydrous ammonia (AA) and urea as nitrogen (N) fertilizer sources in the United States, there have been few direct comparisons of their effects on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. We compared N oxide emissions, yields, and N fertilizer recovery efficiency (NFRE) in a corn (Zea mays L.) production system that used three different fertilizer practices: urea that was broadcast and incorporated (BU) and AA that was injected at a conventional depth (0.20 m) (AAc) and at a shallower depth (0.10 m) (AAs). Averaged over 2 yr in an irrigated loamy sand in Minnesota, growing season N2O emissions increased in the order BU < AAc < AAs. In contrast, NO emissions were greater with BU than with AAc or AAs. Emissions of N2O ranged from 0.5 to 1.4 kg N ha(-1) (50-140 g N Mg-1 grain), while NO emissions ranged from 0.2 to 0.7 kg N ha(-1) (20-70 g N Mg-1 grain). Emissions of total N oxides (NO + N2O) increased in the order AAc < BU < AAs. Despite having the greatest emissions of N2O and total N oxides, the AAs treatment had greater NFRE compared with the AAc treatment. These results provide additional evidence that AA emits more N2O, but less NO, than broadcast urea and show that practices to reduce N2O emissions do not always improve N use efficiency.

AB Nitrogen oxides (NOx x = NO + NO2) 2 ) have essential impacts on global climate and the environment, making it essential to study the contribution of wetland-generated NOx x to environmental problems. With exogenous nitrogen input from anthropogenic activities, wetland sediments become active emission hotspots for NOx. x . In this study, we conducted field experiments in a typical salt marsh wetland to measure nitric oxide (NO, the primary component of NOx x from sediments) exchange fluxes in both mudflat and vegetated sediments. We found that NO fluxes in vegetated sediments (0.40 +/- 0.15 x 10-12 kg N m- 2 s-1)-1 ) were relatively higher than in mudflat sediments (-1.31 +/- 1.39 x 10-12 kg N m- 2 s-- 1 ), with this difference occurring only during the vegetation-dying season (autumn). Correlations between sediment NO fluxes and environmental parameters revealed that NO flux variation during the observation period was primarily influenced by sediment respiration, temperature, water content, and substrate availability. However, the influence of these factors on NO fluxes differed between mudflat and vegetated sediments. In-situ data analysis also suggested that tidal horizontal migration, which affects sediment substrate and salinity, may regulate sediment NO emissions. Furthermore, in-situ incubations with nitrogen addition (ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate) were conducted to study the response of sediment NO emissions to exogenous nitrogen. We observed that nitrogen addition caused a 259.7 % increase in NO emissions from vegetated sediments compared to the control during the effective period of nitrogen addition (days 1-3). However, although nitrogen addition markedly stimulated sediment NO emissions, the overall NO production capacity constrained the extent of this increase.

AB The EMEP MSC-W Eulerian chemical transport model is used to investigate a number of features concerning the concentrations and depositions of reactive nitrogen species over Europe, with a focus on forest ecosystems and soil emissions. We illustrate the relative contributions of oxidised versus reduced nitrogen, and of dry versus wet deposition, to nitrogen inputs to forests. A comparison with measurements, including data for the NOFRETETE sites, showed that the EMEP model performs generally well for N-compounds, although with some problems for NH3 which is difficult to model with a large-scale model.
   The model was modified to make use of a new forest-soil-NO inventory (with daily resolution) from the NOFRETETE project and used to calculate the potential effects of these emissions on N-deposition to forests, and on the ozone-indicator AOT40. The contribution of soil-NO to these environmental measures was found to be generally small, but significant in some areas, with changes ranging between 0-20% in Central Europe and even greater in Scandinavia. Given the large uncertainties in soil-NO emission estimates, it is clear that this source is potentially comparable in its importance to many combustion sources in parts of Europe, and deserves more attention.

AB We investigated nitric oxide (NO) fluxes at a summer and a winter sheepfold in the Baiyinxile livestock farm, near Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia, which are a typical feature of the regional husbandry. Using a manual static opaque chamber/chemiluminescence measuring system, we intermittently observed fluxes in the summer sheepfold between May 28th and September 26th 2005 and in both winter and summer sheepfolds between March 8th and October 18th 2006. During these periods, mean NO emissions (+/- S.E., in terms of mass of nitrogen) were 124.0 +/- 28.7, 134.6 +/- 23.3 (summer sheepfold) and 214.4 +/- 79.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) (winter sheepfold), respectively, and thus, three magnitudes higher than observed steppe NO emissions in the same region. The NO fluxes were not significantly different between the 2 years, but in summer they were much higher than in spring (p < 0.05). Temperature and moisture of the faeces layer significantly regulated the NO fluxes (p < 0.01). The direct NO emission factor (EF) for faeces and urine excreted in the sheepfolds was 0.7 g NO-N-emitted kg(-1) N-excreted, which was almost 37 times lower than a recently reported N2O EF. We estimated the total No emission from the sheepfolds of the Baiyinxile livestock farm to be 1.82 +/- 0.43 tons NO-N year(-1), which accounts to approximately 12.3% of the total NO emission from this steppe region. With the rapid increase of livestock numbers, sheepfold NO emissions may further increase and contribute to high N deposition in confined areas around sheepfolds. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB N-15 isotope tracing is an effective and direct approach to investigate sources of nitric oxide (NO) formed in soils. However, NO is highly reactive and rapidly converted to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the presence of ozone, making it impossible to directly measure N-15 in NO. Various wet-chemical methods for conversion of NO to nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) have been proposed for N-15 analysis in high-concentration NO sources, such as combustion processes. In contrast, NO concentrations in the soil surface-near air are usually small (ppbv-range), posing major challenges to conversion efficiency and blank correction. Here, we present a modified method in which NO is oxidized quantitatively to NO2 by chromium trioxide (CrO3), before conversion to NO2- and NO3- in an alkaline hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution. A denitrifier method was used to reduce NO2- and NO3- in the trapping solution quantitatively to nitrous oxide (N2O) for subsequent N-15 analysis. NO trapping efficiencies of >85% were obtained with 50 ppb NO in a 0.5 L min(-1) air stream bubbling through a solution of 1.2 M H2O2 and 0.5 M NaOH. In a laboratory test with distinct (NO)-N-15 abundances, the overall precision was 0.29 (d-values) for natural abundance NO and 0.13 atom % for labeled NO, suggesting that our method can be used for both natural abundance studies and N-15 labeling experiments. In a soil incubation experiment with (NH4NO3)-N-15, NH4(15)NO(3), or (NaNO2)-N-15 amendments, we found distinct N-15 abundances in NO, indicating that our method is well suited to investigate NO sources in soils.

AB The use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture produces significant quantities of nitrogenous gases including ammonia, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide. Through better farmland management practices, the emission of nitrogenous gases can be reduced while realizing clean water environment and climate-smart agriculture. In this article, we first provided an overview of the international movements on reducing nitrogenous gas emissions from farmlands. Then, we summarized the effect of agricultural management practices on nitrogen use efficiency for various crops, and evaluated their effect on nitrogenous gas emissions. The results indicated the importance of implementing site-specific sustainable management practices to enhance nitrogen use efficiency, and thus mitigate nitrogenous gas emissions. We also addressed the impact of agricultural activities on cropland nitrogen cycles, and highlighted the need to perform systematic trade-off evaluations with a well-defined scope to maximize environmental benefits and maintain ecosystem services. Lastly, we proposed three priority directions by moving toward a low-emission agriculture.

AB A full accounting of net greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) was examined in an annual coastal reclaimed saline Jerusalem artichoke-fallow cropping system under various soil practices including soil tillage, soil ameliorant, and crop residue amendments. Seasonal fluxes of soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured using static chamber method, and the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was determined by the difference between soil heterotrophic respiration (R-H) and net primary production (NPP). Relative to no-tillage, rotary tillage significantly decreased the NPP of Jerusalem artichoke while it had no significant effects on the annual R-H. Rotary tillage increased CH4 emissions, while seasonal or annual soil N2O emissions did not statistically differ between the two tillage treatments. Compared with the control plots, soil ameliorant or straw amendment enhanced R-H, soil CH4, and N2O emissions under the both tillage regimes. Annual NGHGB was negative for all the field treatments, as a consequence of net ecosystem CO2 sequestration exceeding the CO2-equivalents released as CH4 and N2O emissions, which indicates that Jerusalem artichoke-fallow cropping system served as a net sink of GHGs. The annual net NGHGB and GHGI were estimated to be 11-21% and 4-8% lower in the NT than in RT cropping systems, respectively. Soil ameliorant and straw amendments greatly increased NPP and thus significantly decreased the negative annual net NGHGB. Overall, higher NPP but lower climatic impacts of coastal saline bioenergy production would be simultaneously achieved by Jerusalem artichoke cultivation under no-tillage with improved saline soil conditions in southeast China.

AB The invasion of drylands by leguminous mesquite (Prosopis spp.) is frequently associated with increases in the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. These increases stimulate soil microbial activity and accelerate soil C and N cycling. However, the impact of mesquite invasion on soil biogeochemistry, especially the emission of trace gases, in an ecosystem with an already established population of N-fixing plants is not well studied. To fill this knowledge gap, we quantified the in-situ soil trace gas emissions and the potential microbial activity in soils under invasive mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) trees (Prosopis), native acacia (Acacia tortilis) trees (Acacia), and in unvegetated soil between trees (Bare soil) on the western shore of the Dead Sea. To account for contributions of spatial and weather variabilities to the emission processes we conducted measurements across two geographic sites, 45 km apart, over two years, both under naturally dry soil conditions and after soil wetting. Before wetting, soil emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NOx) followed the order: Acacia > Prosopis >= Bare soil, while soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were low and uniform across the three habitats. The soil inorganic N concentration, microbial biomass, and water-extractable organic C were significantly higher under the A. tortilis canopies compared with P. juliflora and Bare soil. After wetting, soil trace gases emissions increased up to 66, 1534, and 42 times, for CO2, N2O, and NOx, respectively, and remained higher under the native A. tortilis than under P. juliflora and Bare soil (Acacia > Prosopis > Bare soil). The potential soil microbial activity, however, was similar between the soils under the tree canopies. Our results show that the establishment of invasive leguminous trees increase soil CO2 and gaseous N emissions relative to the Bare soils, but not relative to native leguminous trees.

AB We estimated the emissions of different forms of gaseous nitrogen (N) from natural terrestrial ecosystems using newly upscaled soil delta 15N maps, data-constrained gas partitioning models, and incorporating the previously missing N input flux from rock weathering. The emissions for nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and dinitrogen (N2) are estimated at 12 +/- 3, 19 +/- 4, and 12 +/- 3 Tg N yr-1, respectively. The Sixth Phase of Coupled Intercomparison Model Project (CMIP6) models tend to overestimate total gaseous N emissions and thus N2O emissions. Correcting these total gaseous N emissions to match soil delta 15N maps and applying gas partitioning models, the CMIP6 models' N2O emission estimates drop to 7 +/- 2 Tg N yr-1, consistent with this study and N2O Model Intercomparison Project 2. Differences in gas partitioning models also contribute significantly to uncertainties in N2O emission estimates. This study underscores the need for improved modeling of gaseous N emissions and partitioning in CMIP6 models to better understand the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change.

TI Quantifying the influence of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate on soil

AB 3,4-Dimethyl pyrazole phosphate (DMPP) is commonly used to regulate soil nitrogen transformation and mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, while reclaimed water (RW) irrigation alleviates freshwater shortages but may alter soil properties, affecting N2O emissions. However, the interaction between DMPP and RW irrigation on N2O emission pathways remains underexplored. This study conducted a field experiment with two water quality regimes (RW and groundwater (GW)) and two nitrogen fertilizer conditions (with and without DMPP) to assess soil N2O, nitric oxide (NO), and ammonia (NH3) emissions. Using the 1 5N tracing technique, we investigated microbial mechanisms underlying N2O and NO production under multi-year RW irrigation. The findings indicate that although DMPP effectively reduced soil N2O and NO concentrations within the 0-30 cm depth, thereby lowering their emissions under RW irrigation, its application also led to an increase in soil NH3 volatilization. Consequently, cumulative N2O emissions shifted from 2020 to 2021, with reductions of 15.11 %-38.46 % under RW irrigation and 36.88 %-48.29 % under GW irrigation. However, the inhibitory effect of DMPP was weaker under RW irrigation compared to GW irrigation. This reduction was influenced by RW irrigation, which enhanced the abundance of nitrifying microbial communities and increased the contribution of heterotrophic nitrification to soil N2O emissions, thereby mitigating the inhibitory effect of DMPP on autotrophic nitrification. Overall, it emphasized the need for optimized nitrogen management strategies under RW irrigation to maximize emission reductions while minimizing trade-offs in NH3 volatilization and microbial-driven nitrogen transformations.

AB Paddies are a potential source of anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. In paddies, both the soil and the rice plants emit N2O into the atmosphere. The rice plant in the paddy is considered to act as a channel between the soil and the atmosphere for N2O emission. However, recent studies suggest that plants can also produce N2O, while the mechanism of N2O formation in plants is unknown. Consequently, the rice plant is only regarded as a channel for N2O produced by soil microorganisms. The emission of N2O by aseptically grown plants and the distinct dual isotopocule fingerprint of plant-emitted N2O, as reported by various studies, support the production of N2O in plants. Herein, we propose a potential pathway of N2O formation in the rice plant. In rice plants, N2O might be formed in the mitochondria via the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide (NO3-NO2-NO) pathway when the cells experience hypoxic or anoxic stress. The pathway is catalyzed by various enzymes, which have been described. So, N2O emitted from paddies might have two origins, namely soil microorganisms and rice plants. So, regarding rice plants only as a medium to transport the microorganism-produced N2O might be misleading in understanding the role of rice plants in the paddy. As rice cultivation is a major agricultural activity worldwide, not understanding the pathway of N2O formation in rice plants would create more uncertainties in the N2O budget.

AB South Asia is experiencing a rapid increase in nitrogen (N) pollution which is predicted to continue in the future. One of the possible implications is an increase in gaseous reactive N losses from soil, notably in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Current knowledge of N2O and NO dynamics in forest ecosystems is not sufficient to understand and mitigate the impacts on climate and air quality. In order to improve the understanding of emissions from two major land uses in Sri Lanka, we investigated the emission potential for N2O and NO fluxes measured by absorption spectroscopy and chemiluminescence, respectively, in response to three different N addition levels (the equivalent of 0, 40 and 100 kg N ha-1 yr.-1 deposition in the form of NH4+) from soils of two typical land uses in Sri Lanka: a secondary montane tropical forest and a tea plantation using soil laboratory incubations of repacked soil cores. We observed an increase in NO fluxes which was directly proportional to the amount of N applied in line with initial expectations (maximum flux ranging from 6-8 ng NO-N g-1 d-1 and from 16-68 ng NO-N g-1 d-1 in forest and tea plantation soils, respectively). However, fluxes of N2O did not show a clear response to N addition, the highest treatment (100 N) did not result in the highest fluxes. Moreover, fluxes of N2O were higher following the addition of a source of carbon (in the form of glucose) across treatment levels and both land uses (maximum flux of 2-34 ng N2O-N g-1 d-1 in forest and 808-3,939 ng N2O-N g-1 d-1 in tea plantation soils). Both N2O and NO fluxes were higher from tea plantation soils compared to forest soils irrespective of treatment level, thus highlighting the importance of land use and land management for gaseous reactive N fluxes and therefore N dynamics.

AB Winter weather patterns are changing due to global climate change, which impacts the soil nitrogen cycle and greenhouse gas flux in these ecosystems, particularly the snow cover in temperate deserts. Biological soil crusts are important soil communities of the desert ecosystem and are sensitive to environmental changes. However, knowledge of the responses of gaseous nitrogen emissions from biological soil crusts to changes in snow cover is limited. In this study, the effects of snow cover on gaseous nitrogen emissions and the abundance of nitrifier (amoA) and denitrifier (narG, nirS, nirK, nosZ) genes were investigated in three snow cover treatments (snow removal, ambient snow, and increased snow depth). Snow cover significantly affected N2O and NO emissions from bare sand and biological soil crusts in winter. The abundance of denitrifier genes in bare sand and biological soil crusts and the abundance of nitrifier genes in moss crust increased with the depths of snow addition. N2O emissions increased with the successional stages of biological soil crusts during the winter. Both N2O and NO emissions from bare sand and biological soil crusts peaked in the freeze-thaw period (March) and were lowest in mid-winter (January). The emissions of N2O increased with increasing the abundance of amoA, nirK and nosZ genes. Our findings show that N2O emissions generally increased with increasing snow cover through their ef-fects on nitrogen cycle related functional microbial groups. These effects were regulated by the types of bio-logical soil crust, which can increase the effect of snow cover in winter.

AB Elevated N deposition has occurred in the Los Angeles Basin in southern California for at least the last 40 years. Elevated streamwater NO3- fluxes and high nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from soil, indicators of N saturation, have recently been reported for chaparral watersheds exposed to chronic N deposition in the San Gabriel Mountains north/northeast of Los Angeles. A number of nutritional and edaphic parameters across a deposition gradient in the San Bernardino Mountains (SBM) support the hypothesis that the mixed conifer forest in the western end of the range is also N saturated. Concentrations of NO3- in the soil solution or in soil extracts during the summer months were 14 to 44 times higher at Camp Paivika (CP), a western high N deposition site, than at Camp Osceola (CAO) or Barton Flats (BF), eastern low-pollution sites. Accumulation of NO3- in foliage of bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum var. pubescens Undenw.) and overstory species was also much greater at CP than at CAO and a site near BF. Nitric oxide fluxes in mid-August from relatively dry soil at CP were ca. 20 times higher than for typical forests in North America. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, on the other hand, were low in the SBM sites. However, emissions of NO and N2O were several-fold higher at CP than at BF, a relatively low-pollution site. High NO emissions from otherwise undisturbed and well-drained forest soils of the western US may prove useful as a diagnostic indicator of N saturation. Nitrogen mineralization was greater at CP and Dogwood (high-pollution sites) than at CAO and Heartbar (low-pollution sites), Additional indicators of N enrichment at CP compared with the low N deposition sites include: low C:N ratios in soil and foliage, high foliar N:P ratios, higher nitrification rates and high soil acidity. Lower pH and base saturation were observed in soil from two high-pollution sites compared with two low-pollution sites. In summary, high NO emissions and elevated NO; concentrations in the soil solution and in foliage, and high foliar N:P ratios at CP, indicate N in excess of biotic demand, with potential above-normal loss of N from the ecosystem - and thus, a N-saturated condition. Model outputs from the nutrient cycling model (NuCM) agreed well with field data from the SBM on elevated soil solution NO3- concentrations, reduced soil base saturation, and lack of a growth response to increasing N deposition.

AB Soil emissions of NO and N2O were measured continuously at high frequency for more than one year at 15 European forest sites as part of the EU-funded project NOFRETETE. The locations represent different forest types (coniferous/deciduous) and different nitrogen loads. Geoaphically they range from Finland in the north to Italy in the south and from Hungary in the east to Scotland in the west.
   The highest NO emissions were observed from coniferous forests, whereas the lowest NO emissions were observed from deciduous forests. The NO emissions from coniferous forests were highly correlated with N-deposition. The site with the highest average annual emission (82 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)) was a spruce forest in South-Germany (Hoglwald) receiving an annual N-deposition of 2.9 g m(-2). NO emissions close to the detection limit were observed from a pine forest in Finland where the N-deposition was 0.2 N m(-2) a(-1). No significant correlation between N2O emission and N-deposition was found. The highest average annual N2O emission (20 mu g N2O-Nm(-2) h(-1)) was found in an oak forest in the Matra mountains (Hungary) receiving an annual N-deposition of 1.6 g m(-2). N2O emission was significantly negatively correlated with the C/N ratio.
   The difference in N-oxide emissions from soils of coniferous and deciduous forests may partly be explained by differences in N-deposition rates and partly by differences in characteristics of the litter layer and soil. NO was mainly derived from nitrification whereas N2O was mainly derived from denitrification. In general, soil moisture is lower at coniferous sites (at least during spring time) and the litter layer of coniferous forests is thick and well aerated favouring nitrification and thus release of NO. Conversely, the higher rates of denitrification in deciduous forests due to a compact and moist litter layer lead to N2O production and NO consumption in the soil.
   The two factors soil moisture and soil temperature are often explaining most of the temporal variation within a site. When comparing annual emissions on a regional scale, however, factors such as nitrogen deposition and forest and soil type become much more important.

AB Fertilized agricultural soils are a significant source of NO, a gas involved in tropospheric ozone formation. The aims of the research reported here were to measure NO fluxes over the length of the growing season of wheat and maize crops, and to build a model of soil NO emissions from arable land. Field experiments were carried out on a 1-ha field divided into two parts. The first one was cropped with wheat and harvested in late July, 2002, whereas the second part was sown with maize and harvested in October. The wheat and maize received 130 kg N ha(-1) and 140 kg N ha(-1), respectively. For each crop, NO fluxes were measured during 10 months every 2 weeks using manual closed chambers, and continuously with a wind tunnel immediately after nitrogen fertilization. Fertilizer application significantly affected NO emissions: the largest NO emissions were recorded a few days after nitrogen application. This delay depended on the kinetics of nitrogen incorporation in the soil, as influenced by rainfall. The emissions measured on the maize field (2.6% of the fertilizer amount applied) were more important than those on the wheat field (1.0% of the fertilizer amount applied), owing to differences in timing of nitrogen application, with respect to climate and crop growth. Relationships between soil nitrification rate and NO emission obtained from laboratory incubations, and experimental data appeared useful and relevant to predict NO emissions at the field-scale.

AB Changes in precipitation in the Amazon Basin resulting from regional deforestation, global warming, and El Nino events may affect emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) from soils. Changes in soil emissions of radiatively important gases could have feedback implications for regional and global climates. Here we report results of a large-scale (1 ha) throughfall exclusion experiment conducted in a mature evergreen forest near Santarem, Brazil. The exclusion manipulation lowered annual N2O emissions by >40% and increased rates of consumption of atmospheric CH4 by a factor of >4. No treatment effect has yet been detected for NO and CO2 fluxes. The responses of these microbial processes after three rainy seasons of the exclusion treatment are characteristic of a direct effect of soil aeration on denitrification, methanogenesis, and methanotrophy. An anticipated second phase response, in which drought-induced plant mortality is followed by increased mineralization of C and N substrates from dead fine roots and by increased foraging of termites on dead coarse roots, has not yet been detected. Analyses of depth profiles of N2O and CO2 concentrations with a diffusivity model revealed that the top 25 cm soil is the site of most of the wet season production of N2O, whereas significant CO2 production occurs down to 100 cm in both seasons, and small production of CO2 occurs to at least 1100 cm depth. The diffusivity-based estimates of CO2 production as a function of depth were strongly correlated with fine root biomass, indicating that trends in belowground C allocation may be inferred from monitoring and modeling profiles of H2O and CO2.

AB Aerobic production of N(2)O and N(2) from denitrification in four low-fertility ecosystems was measured using the short-lived radioisotope (13)N. The ecosystems, comprising two pastures, native beech (Nothofagus truncata) forest and exotic pine (Pinus radiata) forest, all had the same soil and the same slope and aspect. There was no consistent seasonal pattern of emissions, although the soils were dry on all three occasions (summer, autumn and spring) that samples were taken. Emission rates and N(2)O-to-N(2) ratios were generally highest in the surface 0-2 cm in the pasture soils, but not as frequently in the forest soils. Some of the forest soil samples produced a third gas, tentatively identified as NO. Emissions of N(2)O, but not of N(2), appeared to be generally greater from the forest than from the pasture sites, although only a limited number of samples were studied. Nitrate-N concentrations were generally low (ranging from 0.36 to 57.4 mg kg(-1), mean 3.27 mg kg(-1)) in these samples. Production of N(2)O, estimated from the relativity between (13)NO(3)(-)-N added and NO(3)(-)-N present in the soil, placed these ecosystems at the lower end of emission rates for undisturbed ecosystems, with rates ranging from 0.02 to 6.38 ng N(2)O-N g(-1) soil h(-1) (mean 0.65 ng N(2)O-N g(-1) soil h(-1)).

AB Tea plantations are rapidly expanding in China and other countries in the tropical and subtropical zones, but so far there are very few studies including direct measurements of nitrogenous gas fluxes from tea plantations. On the basis of 2-year field measurements from 2012 to 2014, we provided an insight into the assessment of annual nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from Chinese subtropical tea plantations under three practices of conventional urea application, alternative oilcake incorporation and no nitrogen fertilization. Clearly, the N2O and NO fluxes exhibited large intra-and inter-annual variations, and furthermore, their temporal variability could be well described by a combination of soil environmental factors including soil mineral N, water-filled pore space and temperature, based on a revised "hole-in-the-pipe" model. Averaged over a 2-year study, annual background N2O and NO emissions were approximately 4.0 and 1.6 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Compared to no nitrogen fertilization, both urea and oilcake application significantly stimulated annual N2O and NO emissions, amounting to 14.4-32.7 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and at least 12.3-19.4 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In comparison with conventional urea treatment, on average, the application of organic fertilizer significantly increased N2O emission by 71% but decreased NO emission by 22 %. Although the magnitude of N2O and NO fluxes was substantially influenced by the source of N, the annual direct emission factors of N fertilizer were estimated to be 2.8-5.9, 2.7-4.0 and 6.8-9.1% for N2O, NO and N2O+NO, respectively, which are significantly higher than those defaults for global upland croplands. This indicated that the rarely determined N2O and NO formation appeared to be a significant pathway in the nitrogen cycle of tea plantations, which are a potential source of national nitrogenous gases inventory.

AB Crop residues are produced from agriculture in large amounts globally. Crop residues arc known to be a source of nitrous oxide (N2O); however, contrasting results have been reported. Furthermore, the effect of crop residues on nitric oxide (NO) and methane (CH4) fluxes has not been well studied. We investigated N2O, NO, and CH4 fluxes after low C/N crop residue (cabbages and potatoes) inputs to lysi meter fields for two years using with automated flux monitoring system. Lysimeters were filled with two contrasting soil types, Andosol (total C: 33.1 g kg(-1); clay: 18%) and Fluvisol (17.7 g kg(-1); 36%). Nitrogen application rates were 250 kg N ha(-1) of synthetic fertilizer and 272 kg N ha(-1) of cow manure compost for cabbage, and 120 kg N ha(-1) of synthetic fertilizer and 136 kg N ha(-1) of cow manure compost for potato, respectively. Large N2O peaks were observed after crop residues were left on the surface of the soil for 1 to 2 weeks in summer, but not in winter. The annual N2O emission factors (EFs) for cabbage residues were 3.02% and 537% for Andosol and Fluvisol, respectively. Those for potatoes were 751% and 5.10% for Andosol and Fluvisol, respectively. The EFs were much higher than the mean EFs of synthetic fertilizers from Japan's agricultural fields (0.62%). Moreover, the EFs were much higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default N2O EFs for synthetic fertilizers and crop residues (1%). The annual NO EFs for potatoes were 1.35% and 2,44% for Andosol and Fluvisol, respectively, while no emission was observed after cabbage residue input. Crop residues did not affect CH4 uptake by soil. Our results suggest that low C/N crop residue input to soils can create a hotspot of N2O emission, when temperature and water conditions are not limiting factors for microbial activity.

AB Fertilizer and irrigation management are two of the most important factors which directly influence nitrification and denitrification processes from agricultural soils and, therefore, emissions of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and nitric oxide (NO). To date, the effect of combining organic fertilizer (applied before planting) with a drip irrigation system (DI) on the emissions of these nitrogen (N) oxides has not been evaluated. The different distribution and amount of water applied with this irrigation system should produce less favourable conditions for denitrification than other irrigation systems, such as furrow irrigation (FI), and this could be used to mitigate emissions of N(2)O, especially following organic fertilizer application. In order to test this hypothesis, a field experiment was carried out to compare the influence of FI and DI on N(2)O and NO emissions using digested pig slurry (DPS) as organic fertilizer during a melon crop (Cucumis melo L cv. Sancho) season. Plots without any N fertilizer were used as a control (control). The irrigation system influenced the water distribution pattern, producing significantly higher ammonium-N (NH(4)(+)-N) and nitrate-N (NO(3)(-)-N) concentrations in the soil under DI than under FI. Moreover, the differences observed in water filled pore space (WFPS) and mineral N also favoured a different pattern of emissions of N oxides. Only one large pulse of N(2)O (106.9 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and NO (0.81 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) were observed for FI after the first irrigation event while several pulses were observed for DI during the entire experimental period. As a consequence, nitrous oxide emissions were 75% and 28% lower from control and DPS, respectively under DI than under FI. In contrast, NO emissions were higher for DI on some sampling dates in both treatments, but without significant differences in the cumulative NO emissions between both irrigation systems. In conclusion, this work shows that combining drip irrigation with organic fertilizer for horticultural crops in semiarid climates could be a good management strategy for three reasons: it saves water: it re-uses organic residues and it mitigates N(2)O emissions.

AB Globally, tropical forest soils represent the second largest source of N2O and NO. However, there is still considerable uncertainty on the spatial variability and soil properties controlling N trace gas emission. Therefore, we carried out an incubation experiment with soils from 31 locations in the Nyungwe tropical mountain forest in southwestern Rwanda. All soils were incubated at three different moisture levels (50, 70 and 90 % water filled pore space (WFPS)) at 17 A degrees C. Nitrous oxide emission varied between 4.5 and 400 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), while NO emission varied from 6.6 to 265 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Mean N2O emission at different moisture levels was 46.5 +/- 11.1 (50 %WFPS), 71.7 +/- 11.5 (70 %WFPS) and 98.8 +/- 16.4 (90 %WFPS) mu g N m(-2) h(-1), while mean NO emission was 69.3 +/- 9.3 (50 %WFPS), 47.1 +/- 5.8 (70 %WFPS) and 36.1 +/- 4.2 (90 %WFPS) mu g N m(-2) h(-1). The latter suggests that climate (i.e. dry vs. wet season) controls N2O and NO emissions. Positive correlations with soil carbon and nitrogen indicate a biological control over N2O and NO production. But interestingly N2O and NO emissions also showed a positive correlation with free iron and a negative correlation with soil pH (only N2O). The latter suggest that chemo-denitrification might, at least for N2O, be an important production pathway. In conclusion improved understanding and process based modeling of N trace gas emission from tropical forests will benefit from spatially explicit trace gas emission estimates linked to basic soil property data and differentiating between biological and chemical pathways for N trace gas formation.

AB Production of NO and N(2)O in soils is mainly caused by microbial ammonium oxidation (nitrification) and nitrate reduction (denitrification). However, the nitrogen oxides are not the end products of these processes. NO and N(2)O are also consumed during denitrification. NO is in addition consumed by unspecific oxidation to nitrate catalyzed by heterotrophic bacteria. Production rates of NO, uptake rate constants of NO and release rates of N(2)O were measured in various soils from agricultural, meadow, temperate forest, savanna and rain forest sites. The relative contribution of ammonium oxidation to the production of NO and N(2)O was determined by the acetylene inhibition technique. The rates of NO and N(2)O turnover are strongly affected by soil temperature and moisture. To avoid that these environmental variables mask the controlling effects of other soil characteristics, the turnover rates of NO and N(2)O were measured under standardized conditions, i.e. at 25'Cdegrees and a soil moisture of 60 % WHC. Under these conditions, soils with high N(2)O release systematically also exhibited higher NO production rates. The NO uptake rate constants, on the other hand, were not correlated with the NO production rates, both varying over 2 orders of magnitude. However, NO uptake rate constants were systematically larger in those soils which exhibited relatively large rates of NO+N(2)O production from denitrification, indicating that denitrification also contributed to NO consumption in the tested soils. Under standardized conditions, the rates of NO production in the various soils were generally higher than the rates of N(2)O production, and ammonium oxidation generally contributed more to the production of NO than of N(2)O.

AB Measurements of NO-NO2-O-3 trace gas exchange were performed for two transition season periods during the La Nina a year 1999 (30 April to 17 May, "wet-dry," and 24 September to 27 October, "dry-wet") over a cattle pasture in Rondonia. A dynamic chamber system (applied during the dry-wet season) was used to directly measure emission fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) and surface resistances for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) deposition. A companion study was simultaneously performed in an old-growth forest. In order to determine ecosystem-representative NO2 and O-3 deposition fluxes for both measurement periods, an inferential method (multiresistance model) was applied to measure ambient NO2 and O-3 concentrations using observed quantities of turbulent transport. Supplementary measurements included soil NO diffusivity and soil nutrient analysis. The observed NO soil emission fluxes were nine times lower than old-growth rain forest emissions under similar soil moisture and temperature conditions and were attributed to the combination of a reduced soil N cycle and lower effective soil NO diffusion at the pasture. Canopy resistances (R-c) of both gases controlled the deposition processes during the day for both measurement periods. Day and night NO2 canopy resistances were significantly similar (alpha = 0.05) during the dry-wet period. Ozone canopy resistances revealed significantly higher daytime resistances of 106 s m(-1) versus 65 s m(-1) at night because of plant, soil, and wet skin uptake processes, enhanced by stomatal activity at night and aqueous phase chemistry on vegetative and soil surfaces. The surface of the pasture was a net NOx sink during 1999, removing seven times more NO2 from the atmosphere than was emitted as NO.

AB The NO flux rates were measured on a sandy loam at Haxthauser Hof near Mainz in summer 1983. Significant emissions of NO(y) species other than NO were also occasionally measured. The data show that the NO and NO(y) emission rates are dependent on soil temperature, soil moisture, soil porosity, fertilization, plant cover, soil organic matter content, and NO and NO(y) mixing ratios in ambient air. Generally, one of these variables dominated and masked the influence of the others. In some cases the soil treatment led to the replacement of one dominating controlling factor by another one. In most cases, NO and NO(y) emission was observed at low, and deposition at high, mixing ratios of NO and NO(y) in the ambient air. The compensation points, i.e., the mixing ratios at which the flux from the soil is zero, varied between 0-5.5 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) for NO and 0-16.3 ppbv for NO(y) depending on the plant cover, soil temperature, soil organic matter content, and fertilization. Because the compensation points are of the same order of magnitude as the NO and NO(y) mixing ratios in ambient air, knowledge of the variables controlling them is essential for creditable estimations of the global NO(x) emissions by soils.

AB Numerous studies have shown that soil moisture controls NO flux from soils. Less is known, however, to what extent microbial N-cycling mediates this control. Does soil moisture control NO release primarily by affecting the physical gas exchange between soil and atmosphere, by modulating microbial activities involved in biotic NO turnover, or by both? Using a novel dynamic chamber system for high-resolution measurement of NO release, we found one or several soil-specific maxima of NO release during dry-out experiments in different soils. A mid-latitude arable soil displayed a single maximum at 0.10 water holding capacity (whc), whereas a dryland farming and a rice paddy soil showed two maxima at 0.65/0.10 and 0.90/0.10 whc, respectively. Transcription of nirS genes in the dryland soil at 0.65 whc was low, but larger than at 0.10 whc, while transcriptional activity of archaeal ammonia oxidizers showed the opposite pattern with higher activity at 0.10 whc, suggesting biogenic NO production at low soil moisture. Our study is a first attempt to link NO emission to soil moisture responses of different microbial groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing tropospheric ozone (O-3) and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition alter the structure and composition of pastures. These changes could affect N and C compounds in the soil that in turn can influence soil microbial activity and processes involved in the emission of N oxides, methane (CH4) and carbon dioidde (CO2), but these effects have been scarcely studied. Through an open top chamber (OTC) field experiment, the combined effects of both pollutants on soil gas emissions from an annual experimental Mediterranean community were assessed. Four O-3 treatments and three different N input levels were considered. Fluxes of nitric (NO) and nitrous (N2O) oxide, CH4 and CO2 were analysed as well as soil mineral N and dissolved organic carbon. Belowground plant parameters like root biomass and root C and N content were also sampled. Ozone strongly increased soil N2O emissions, doubling the cumulative emission through the growing cycle in the highest O-3 treatment, while N-inputs enhanced more slightly NO; CH4 and CO2 where not affected. Both N-gases had a clear seasonality, peaking at the start and at the end of the season when pasture physiological activity is minimal; thus, higher microorganism activity occurred when pasture had a low nutrient demand. The O-3-induced peak of N2O under low N availability at the end of the growing season was counterbalanced by the high N inputs. These effects were related to the O-3 x N significant interaction found for the root-N content in the grass and the enhanced senescence of the community. Results indicate the importance of the belowground processes, where competition between plants and microorganisms for the available soil N is a key factor, for understanding the ecosystem responses to O-3 and N.

AB Increases in the atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) contribute to global warming and to ozone depletion in the stratosphere Nitric oxide (NO) is a cause of acid rain and tropospheric ozone. The use of N fertilizers in agriculture has direct and indirect effects an the emissions of both these gases, which are the result of microbial nitrification and denitrification in the soil, and which are controlled principally by soil water and mineral N contents, temperature and labile organic matter
   The global emission of N2O from cultivated land is now estimated at 3.5 Tg N annually of which 1.5 Tg has been directly attributed ro synthetic N fertilizers, out of a total quantity applied in 1990 of about 77 Tg N. This amount was 150% above the 1970 figure. The total fertilizer-induced emissions of NO are somewhere in the range 0.5-5 Tg N. Mineral N fertilizers can also be indirect as well as direct sources of N2O and NO emissions, via deposition of volatilized NH3 on natural ecosystems and denitrification of leached nitrate in subsoils, waters and sediments.
   IPCC currently assume an N2O emission factor of 1.25 +/- 1.0% of fertilizer N applied. No allowance is made for different fertilizer types, on the basis that soil management and cropping systems, and unpredictable rainfall inputs, are more important variables. However, recent results show substantial reductions in emissions from grassland by matching fertilizer type to environmental conditions, and in arable systems by using controlled release fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors, Also better timing and placement of N, application of the minimum amount of N to achieve satisfactory yield, and optimization of soil physical conditions, particularly avoidance of excessive wetness and compaction, would be expected to reduce the average emission factor for N2O. Some of these adjustments would also reduce NO emissions. However, increasing global fertilizer use is likely to cause an upward trend in total emissions even if these mitigating practices become widely adopted.

AB We measured soil nitrogen (N) cycling and fluxes of N2O and NO in three land-use types across the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona. Urbanization increased N2O emissions compared to native landscapes, primarily due to the expansion of fertilized and irrigated lawns. Fluxes of N2O from lawns ranged from 18 to 80 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) and were significantly larger than managed xeric landscapes (2.5-22 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and remnant desert sites within the urban core (3.7-14 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). In contrast, average NO fluxes from lawns were not significantly different from native desert when dry (6-80 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) lawn; 5-16 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) desert) and were lower than fluxes from deserts after wetting events. Furthermore, urbanization has significantly altered the temporal dynamics of NO emissions by replacing pulse-driven desert ecosystems with year-round irrigated, managed lawns. Short-term, pulse-driven emissions of NO from wetting of dry desert soils may reach 35% of anthropogenic emissions within a day after summer monsoon storms. If regional O-3 production is NOx-limited during the monsoon season, fluxes from warm, recently wet arid soils may contribute to summer O-3 episodes.

AB There is a high spatial variation in N2O emission from agricultural fields and N2O emissions from fields cultivated with stalk-crops was generally measured in the interrow area. The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in seasonal N2O emissions between interrow soil and interrow + row soil, and to understand the effect of different fertilizers on N2O emissions in a maize-cultivated sandy loam soil in the North China Plain. The experiment included five treatments: organic manure (OM), half-organic manure N plus half fertilizer N (HOM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NK (NK) and control (CK). Cumulative N2O emission from interrow + row soil during the maize growth season was 0.84-122 kg N ha(-1) with an average of 0.98 kg N ha(-1) in the N-fertilized treatments, significantly higher than the 0.30-0.49 kg N ha(-1) from interrow soil. However, no significant difference was observed in the CK treatment. The measurement in interrow soil underestimated N2O emissions by 44-67%. This difference mainly occurred at the two peak emission periods following fertilizer application probably due to discrepancy in soil denitrification potential. Manure application more efficiently increased difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil than inorganic N fertilizer application. The higher NO concentration did not induce larger N2O emission from interrow soil in the NK treatment than in the NPK treatment, but did from interrow + row soil, resulting in greater difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil. It is suggested that measuring N2O emission solely from interrow soil could underestimate seasonal N2O emissions, and partly mask the effect of N fertilizer application rates on N2O emission in a maize-cultivated soil in the North China Plain.

AB Nitrogen oxide biogenic emissions from soils are driven by soil and environmental parameters. The relationship between these parameters and NO fluxes is highly non linear. A new algorithm, based on a neural network calculation, is used to reproduce the NO biogenic emissions linked to precipitations in the Sahel on the 6 August 2006 during the AMMA campaign. This algorithm has been coupled in the surface scheme of a coupled chemistry dynamics model (MesoNH Chemistry) to estimate the impact of the NO emissions on NOx and O-3 formation in the lower troposphere for this particular episode. Four different simulations on the same domain and at the same period are compared: one with anthropogenic emissions only, one with soil NO emissions from a static inventory, at low time and space resolution, one with NO emissions from neural network, and one with NO from neural network plus lightning NOx. The influence of NOx from lightning is limited to the upper troposphere. The NO emission from soils calculated with neural network responds to changes in soil moisture giving enhanced emissions over the wetted soil, as observed by aircraft measurements after the passing of a convective system. The subsequent enhancement of NOx and ozone is limited to the lowest layers of the atmosphere in modelling, whereas measurements show higher concentrations above 1000 m. The neural network algorithm, applied in the Sahel region for one particular day of the wet season, allows an immediate response of fluxes to environmental parameters, unlike static emission inventories. Stewart et al (2008) is a companion paper to this one which looks at NOx and ozone concentrations in the boundary layer as measured on a research aircraft, examines how they vary with respect to the soil moisture, as indicated by surface temperature anomalies, and deduces NOx fluxes. In this current paper the model-derived results are compared to the observations and calculated fluxes presented by Stewart et al (2008).

AB Land use change and land management practices affect the net emissions of the trace gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon sources and sinks. Changes in CH4 and N2O emissions can substantially alter the overall greenhouse gas balance of a system. Drainage of peatlands for agriculture or forestry generally increases N2O emission as well as that of CO2, but also decreases CH4 emission. Intermittent drainage. or late flooding of rice paddies can greatly diminish the seasonal emission of CH4 compared with continuous flooding. Changes in N2O emissions following land use change from forest or grassland to agriculture vary between climatic zones, and the net impact varies with time. In many soils, the increase in carbon sequestration by adopting no-till systems may be largely negated by associated increases in N2O emission. The promotion of carbon credits for the no-till system before we have better quantification of its net greenhouse gas balance is naive. Applying nitrogen fertilizers to forests could increase the forest carbon sink, but may be accompanied by a net increase in N2O; conversely, adding lime to acid forest soils can decrease the N2O emission.

AB Intensive nitrogen (N) fertilizer application in the vegetable fields of China has commonly occurred during recent decades and may substantially increase both nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. However, the quantification of N2O and NO emissions from vegetable fields has been rare due to both the lack of long-term field measurements and reliable methods for extrapolating these measurements. Using a unique dataset from a four-year measurement study of an intensively managed conventional vegetable field in southeastern China, we tested a process-based biogeochemical model, denitrification-decomposition (DNDC), for its applicability for quantifying the impact of fertilizer management practices on emissions of N trace gases from vegetable production. The results from the model validation indicate that the simulations of vegetable yields and seasonal cumulative N2O and NO emissions are consistent with the observations. In addition, DNDC can generally capture the measured temporal pattern of daily N2O and NO fluxes. The modeled impacts of fertilization alternatives can be summarized as follows: (a) both the type and application rate of N fertilizers play important roles in regulating N2O and NO emissions as well as vegetable growth; (b) reducing the N application rate to 75% of the conventional amount decreased N2O and NO emissions by 31% and showed little impact on vegetable biornasses, suggesting that reducing the N dose to a reasonable level would be advisable for both the mitigation of N gases emissions and the maintenance of vegetable production; and (c) replacing synthetic fertilizer under the conventional management practices with organic manure may significantly stimulate N2O emission by 62% while decreasing vegetable yields. The results from this modeling study may provide useful information for the ongoing debate regarding the optimization of fertilizer use strategies in China. This study also demonstrates the potential of utilizing process-based models, such as DNDC, to quantify and mitigate N2O and NO emissions from intensive vegetable production through interpreting, integrating, and extrapolating field observations.

AB Estuarine wetland sediments are hotspots for nitrogen cycling and critical sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO). Yet studies on the impact of sediment salinity gradients on NO emissions and associated functional microbes at the land-ocean interface remain limited. Here, we measured sediment NO emission rates from incubated sediment samples that were collected from an estuarine wetland in Qingdao, China. Our findings indicate that sediment salinity is a pivotal factor shaping NO emission rates, by altering the community composition and gene abundance of functional microbes involved in NO emissions, with rates ranging from 0.04 to 0.25 mu g N kg-1 dry soil h-1. Metagenomic analysis of the sediment samples reveals that greater NO emission rates (+486 %) under salinity changes are linked to a higher abundance of the nirS gene (+26 %) responsible for NO formation and a lower abundance of norBC genes (-23 %) responsible for NO consumption. Accordingly, the increase of NO emissions may be attributed to the accumulation of denitrifying NO, which could improve plant salt tolerance through co-evolutionary interactions between plants and sediment-dwelling microbes. Taken together, these findings contribute to a richer understanding of how biochemical NO emissions in estuarine wetland sediments respond to salinity gradients.

AB Purpose The contribution of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and nitrite (NO2-) to nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) production remains unclear in vegetable production soils. Materials and methods Soils collected from six typical greenhouse vegetable fields were incubated for 48 h following amendment with 1 mM NaNO2, 10 mu M NH2OH, or 1 mM NaNO2 + 10 mu M NH2OH. The importance of abiotic processes on the NO and N2O formation from the NH2OH and NO2- were studied by irradiating the soil samples with gamma-irradiation. Results and discussion NO2- amendment significantly stimulated NO production, while the NH2OH-dependent NO production was minimal. NH2OH stimulated more abiotic N2O production in alkaline soils than in acidic soils (p < 0.05), while NO2- stimulated more biotic N2O production in acidic soils than in alkaline soils (p < 0.05). The NH2OH- and NO2--dependent sources produced biotic or abiotic N2O with site preference (SP) values of 27.4-36.5 parts per thousand, which is similar to those from ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) or ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) sources (25.1-34.2 parts per thousand), indicating that abiotic N2O production were closely linked with biotic NH3 oxidation. The variability of NO2-+NH2OH-induced N2O production can be explained by the soil organic carbon and iron concentrations, whereas NO2--induced NO production can be explained by the soil pH. Conclusions NO2- addition dominated NO production in all soils. Furthermore, NO2- addition increased biotic N2O production in acidic soils, while NH2OH addition increased abiotic N2O production in alkaline soils. The presence of NO2- could significantly stimulate the abiotic conversion of NH2OH to N2O in soils with low soil organic carbon and high iron concentrations. Thus, assessing the abundance of NH2OH and NO2- could provide crucial information for understanding NO and N2O production procedures in vegetable soils.

AB Nitrogen oxides are key compounds for the oxidation capacity of the troposphere. NO, concentrations depend on the proximity of sources because of their short atmospheric lifetime. An accurate knowledge of the distribution of their sources and sinks is therefore crucial. At global scale, the dominant sources of nitrogen oxides - combustions of fossil fuel (similar to 50%) and biomass burning (similar to 20%) - are basically anthropogenic. Natural sources, including lightning and microbial activity in soils, represent therefore less than 30% of total emissions. Fertilizer use in agriculture constitutes an anthropogenic perturbation to the microbial source. The methods to estimate the magnitude and distribution of these dominant sources of nitrogen oxides are discussed. Some minor sources which may play a specific role in tropospheric chemistry such as NOx emission from aircraft in the upper troposphere or input from production in the stratosphere from N2O photodissociation are also considered.

AB Dryland ecosystems are often nitrogen-limited, and small nitrogen inputs may produce large responses to dryland ecological processes, such as gaseous nitrogen emission. The effect of increased anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on N2O and NO emissions in desert ecosystems is unclear, especially in non-growing seasons when the surface is covered with snow. In this study, nitrogen applications were performed on biological soil crusts (lichen crust and moss crust, bare sand for control) in the Gurbantunggut Desert, Northwest China. We measured the fluxes of N2O and NO and related nitrogen cycle functional gene abundances in winter for three-years period. Nitrogen addition significantly affected N2O emissions and increased the abundances of key functional gene for nitrogen cycle, while it only slightly influenced NO emissions. These effects of nitrogen addition depended on composition of biological soil crusts. For bare sand and lichen crust, nitrogen addition significantly increased N2O emissions, whereas for moss crust, only a negligible effect was observed. Meanwhile, significant differences in nitrogen cycle functional gene abundances were found among different composition of biological soil crusts. Abundance of amoA, narG, and nosZ genes were highly related to N2O and NO emissions. Thus, our results indicate that gaseous nitrogen emissions were generally increased by nitrogen addition through their effects on related functional microbial groups. The effects were regulated by composition of biological soil crusts which can buffer the effects of increasing nitrogen addition during winter.

AB High nitrogen (N) inputs in Chinese vegetable and cereal productions played key roles in increasing crop yields. However, emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO) increased too. For lowering the environmental costs of crop production, it is essential to optimize N strategies to maintain high crop productivity, while reducing the associated N losses. We performed a 2 year-round field study regarding the effect of different combinations of poultry manure and chemical N fertilizers on crop yields, N use efficiency (NUE) and N2O and NO fluxes from a Welsh onion-winter wheat system in the North China Plain. Annual N2O and NO emissions averaged 1.14-3.82 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 5.54-13.06 g N kg(-1) N uptake) and 0.57-1.87 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 2.78-6.38 g N kg(-1) N uptake) over all treatments, respectively. Both N2O and NO emissions increased linearly with increasing total N inputs, and the mean annual direct emission factors (EFd) were 0.39% for N2O and 0.19% for NO. Interestingly, the EFd for chemical N fertilizers (N2O: 0.42-0.48%; NO: 0.07-0.11%) was significantly lower than for manure N (N2O: 1.35%; NO: 0.76%). Besides, a negative power relationship between yield-scaled N2O, NO or N2O + NO emissions and NUE was observed, suggesting that improving NUE in crop production is crucial for increasing crop yields while decreasing nitrogenous gas release. Compared to the current farmers' fertilization rate, alternative practices with reduced chemical N fertilizers increased NUE and decreased annual N2O + NO emissions substantially, while crop yields remained unaffected. As a result, annual yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions were reduced by > 20%. Our study shows that a reduction of current application rates of chemical N fertilizers by 30-50% does not affect crop productivity, while at the same time N2O and NO emissions would be reduced significantly.

AB Excessive nitrogen (N) application in greenhouse cultivation has led to substantial reactive N (Nr) emissions from soils, necessitating effective mitigation strategies. This study presents simultaneous high-frequency monitoring of ammonia (NH3) volatilization, nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions across three greenhouse vegetable seasons (tomato, cabbage and lettuce) under different N management regimes. Key findings reveal that emission factors of NH3, N2O, NO, and NO2 were 0.6 %, 1.6 %, 0.8 % and 0.2 % in greenhouse vegetable systems, respectively. Among the emitted annual Nr gases (8.2-72.0 kg N.ha-1), N2O emissions accounted for the highest proportion of total Nr gas losses. Controlled-release N with organic fertilizer emerged as the most effective strategy, significantly reducing total Nr gas emissions while maintaining high vegetable yield. This reduction was mechanistically linked to suppressed urease activity and decreased expression of key microbial genes (amoA, hao, nirK and norB). N application rate, fertilizer type, soil moisture and temperature were identified as the primary drivers of Nr gas emissions. This study firstly provided crucial empirical emission factors and proportions for NH3, N2O, NO and NO2 gases, offering a technical pathway for synergistically reducing pollution and carbon emissions in greenhouse vegetable cultivation.

AB Legumes can contribute to emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) directly by some rhizobia species that are able to denitrify under free-living conditions and in symbiotic association with the plant. In this study, the capacity of Phaseolus vulgaris-Rhizobium etli symbiosis to emit N2O in response to nitrate (NO3 (-)) has been demonstrated for the first time. We found that bacteroidal assimilatory nitrate reductase (NarB) as well as nitrite reductase (NirK) and nitric oxide reductase (cNor) denitrifying enzymes contribute to nitric oxide (NO) and N2O formation in nodules. We also show that R. etli NarK is involved in NO2 (- )extrusion and links NO3 - reduction by NarB in the cytoplasm with NirK and cNor denitrification activities in the periplasm. The knowledge generated in this work will be instrumental for exploring strategies and sustainable practices in agricultural soil management to increase legume crop yield and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Soil is an important source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Studies of CO2 and N2O emissions from bare soil may explain annual changes in carbon (C) in soil organic matter (SOM) and help analyze N2O production from SOM. Therefore, CO2 and N2O emissions associated with the decomposition of SOM from bare soil are important factors for assessing the C budget and N2O emission in agricultural fields. We conducted a study over 7 years to assess the controlling factors of CO2 and N2O emissions from unplanted and unfertilized soil in Mikasa, Hokkaido, Japan. The CO2 flux increased in summer and there were significant positive correlations between the CO2 flux and soil temperature in the first 4 years. However, apparent relationships between CO2 flux and water-filled pore space, soil NH4 and NO3 concentrations were not observed. The slope of monthly CO2 emission against mean monthly temperature was positively correlated with monthly precipitation. These results suggest that the response of CO2 production to increases in soil temperature became more sensitive in wet soils. The average CO2 emission during the study period was 2.53 Mg C ha-1 year-1, and uncertainty in the annual CO2 emission was 24%. Annual precipitation explained the yearly variation (CO2 emission [Mg C ha-1 year-1] = 0.0021 x annual precipitation [mm year-1] -0.0499, R = 0.976, P < 0.001). Nitrous oxide flux increased from July to October and was positively correlated with CO2 flux. Based on the ratio of N2O-N : NO-N of fluxes, N2O appeared to be the main product of denitrification. The average N2O emission over the study period was 4.88 kg N ha-1 year-1, and uncertainty in the annual N2O emission was 58.5%. Strong relationships between the monthly emissions of CO2 and N2O suggest that N2O production by denitrification is strongly affected by SOM decomposition. Unlike CO2 emission, a relationship between N2O emission and precipitation was not observed because of the multiple pathways of nitrification and denitrification for N2O production induced by SOM decomposition.

AB A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the combined or individual effects of biochar and nitrapyrin (a nitrification inhibitor) on N2O and NO emissions from a sandy loam soil cropped to maize. The study included nine treatments: addition of urea alone or combined with nitrapyrin to soils that had been amended with biochar at 0, 3, 6, and 12 t ha(-1) in the preceding year, and a control without the addition of N fertilizer. Peaks in N2O and NO flux occurred simultaneously following fertilizer application and intense rainfall events, and the peak of NO flux was much higher than that of N2O following application of basal fertilizer. Mean emission ratios of NO/N2O ranged from 1.11 to 1.72, suggesting that N2O was primarily derived from nitrification. Cumulative N2O and NO emissions were 1.00 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 1.39 kg NO-N ha(-1) in the N treatment, respectively, decreasing to 0.81-0.85 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 1.31-1.35 kg NO-N ha(-1) in the biochar amended soils, respectively, while there was no significant difference among the treatments. NO emissions were significantly lower in the nitrapyrin treatments than in the N fertilization-alone treatments (P < 0.05), but there was no effect on N2O emissions. Neither biochar nor nitrapyrin amendment affected maize yield or N uptake. Overall, our results showed that biochar amendment in the preceding year had little effect on N2O and NO emissions in the following year, while the nitrapyrin decreased NO, but not N2O emissions, probably due to suppression of denitrification caused by the low soil moisture content.

AB Fertilizer application in crop production agriculture is a major factor influencing soil emissions of the greenhouse gas N2O. Enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) have the potential to decrease N2O emissions by improving the synchrony between soil N supply and crop N demand. This study was conducted to compare the effects of N2O emissions from soil cropped to corn (Zea mays L.) and EEFs and conventional fertilizers. During a 3-yr period, growing-season N2O emissions were quantified in unfertilized check plots and plots fertilized with urea-NH4NO3 (UAN), UAN containing the urease and nitrification stabilizer AgrotainPlus (UAN+Ag), a stabilized urea containing urease and nitrification inhibitors (SuperU), and a controlled-release polymer-coated urea (ESN). In the third year of the study, conventional urea and an additional fertilizer formulation, Nutrisphere, were evaluated. We observed no reductions in cumulative seasonal N2O emissions from treatments fertilized with the EEFs in any of the study years. Generally, N2O emissions were significantly higher than emissions from the check (no fertilizer) treatment. There were no differences among fertilizer types except in 2009 when the ESN treatment had significantly higher emissions than the check, UAN, and UAN+Ag treatments. Our results indicate that, due to the episodic nature of N2O emissions induced by rainfall events, reduction of N2O emissions through the use of EEFs may be limited in rainfed regions.

AB Emerging evidence suggests that replacing mineral fertilizers with organic livestock manure can effectively suppress reactive gaseous nitrogen (N) emissions from soils. However, the extent of this mitigation potential and the underlying microbial mechanisms in orchards remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we measured nitrous and nitric oxide (N2O and NO) emissions, microbial N cycling gene abundance, and N2O isotopomer ratios in pear and citrus orchards under three different fertilization regimes: no fertilization, mineral fertilizer, and manure plus mineral fertilizer. The results showed that although manure application caused large transient peaks of N2O, it reduced cumulative emissions of N2O and NO by an average of 20 % and 17 %, respectively, compared to the mineral fertilizer treatment. Partial replacement of mineral fertilizers with manure enhanced the contribution of AOA to nitrification and reduced the contribution of AOB, thus reducing N2O emissions from nitrification. Isotope analysis suggested that the pathway for N2O production in the soils of both orchards was dominated by bacterial denitrification and nitrifier denitrification. The manure treatment reduced the ratio of denitrification products. Additionally, the dual isotope mixing model results indicated that partially replacing mineral fertilizers with manure could promote soil denitrification, resulting in more N2O being reduced. N -oxide emissions were on average 67 % higher in the pear orchard than in the citrus orchard, probably due to the differences in soil physicochemical properties and growth habits between the two orchards. These findings underscore the potential of partially replacing mineral fertilizers with organic manure in orchards to reduce gaseous N emissions, contributing to the transition towards environmentally sustainable and climate -smart agricultural practices.

AB The impact of cattle slurry on denitrification losses and nitrous oxide emission was determined on a peat soil in the Netherlands. As well as measuring losses on a day-to-day basis after three different methods of slurry application, two methods for estimating denitrification and nitrous oxide emissions were compared, i.e. coring/incubation and enclosure techniques. Slurry was applied either in a conventional way, diluted 1:3 or acidified with nitric acid. There was much variation with time, method of assessment and method of slurry application in both apparent denitrification rates and N2O fluxes: it was not always possible to provide adequate explanation for all of the effects demonstrated. Major proportions of the variation in denitrification and N2O emission could be accounted for by variation in soil moisture, soil temperature and NH4+ (but not NO3-) content. It was suggested that nitrification was playing a key role in maintaining an adequate substrate supply (NO) for denitrification and perhaps contributing directly to an unknown extent to N2O emissions. There were overall differences in the extent of losses with the different methods of slurry application but these were highly dependent upon interactions with current soil and weather conditions.

AB Changes in precipitation and temperature in Asian continental steppelands may affect soil physical, chemical and biological processes that control the biosphere-atmosphere exchange of N-trace gases. The changes include regional desertification, global warming and strong El Nino events that impact the large steppe land area in China and Mongolia. The area is so large that feedbacks to the global greenhouse gas balance may occur. In this study we investigated how changes in soil moisture and temperature, and especially drying-rewetting and freeze-thaw events, affect nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from large intact soil cores taken from representative land use/cover types in the region of the Xilin River catchment, Inner Mongolia. These soil cores were incubated under varying conditions with respect to temperature (ranging from -10 to 15 degrees C) and simulated rainfall (25, 45 and 65 mm). Following drying-rewetting and freeze-thaw transitions, we observed pulses of NO and N2O emissions from the soils of typical steppe, mountain meadow, sand dune and marshland. A comparable trend in soil CO2 emissions and soil air N2O concentrations indicated that the high substrate availability and rapid recovery of microbial activity after soil wetting and thawing resulted in high gas fluxes. Across the whole temperature range, NO and N2O fluxes from all soils, except for N2O emissions from marshland soils, showed a positive exponential relationship with soil temperature. A combination of soil temperature and soil moisture explained most of the observed variations in NO (up to 74-90%) and N2O (up to 67-89%) fluxes for individual soils. Spatial differences in NO emissions between land use/cover types could be explained by differences in soil organic carbon and pH, whereas spatial variations of N2O fluxes were primarily correlated with differences in soil microbial biomass. On the basis of the incubation under controlled conditions, the average annual flux, weighted by the areal extent of the different investigated land use/cover types in the region, was estimated at similar to 3.9 +/- 1.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for NO and 0.53 +/- 0.20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O, respectively. It is noteworthy that our measurements were conducted using soil cores without a vegetation cover, which probably resulted in an overestimation of N-trace gas fluxes. However, our results indicate that the rarely determined NO formation appears to be a significant pathway in the N cycle of semiarid steppe, which is highly sensitive to the climatic change taking place in these regions, especially an increase in intensity and frequency of drying-wetting and freeze-thaw cycles.

AB The gas-flow-soil-core (GFSC) technique allows to directly measure emission rates of denitrification gases of incubated soil cores. However, the technique was still suffering some drawbacks such as inadequate accuracy due to asynchronous detection of dinitrogen (N-2) and other gases and low measurement frequency. Furthermore, its application was limited due to intensive manual operation. To overcome these drawbacks, we updated the GFSC system as described by Wang et al. (2011) by (a) using both a chemiluminescent detector and a gas chromatograph detector to measure nitric oxide (NO), (b) synchronizing the measurements of N-2, NO, nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), and (c) fully automating the sampling/analysis of all the gases. These technical modifications significantly reduced labor demands by at least a factor of two, increased the measurement frequency from 3 to 6 times per day and resulted in remarkable improvements in measurement accuracy (with detection limits of 0.5, 0.01, 0.05, 2.3 and 0.2 mu g N or C h(-1) kg(-1) ds, or 17, 0.3, 1.8, 82, and 6 mu g N or C m(-2) h(-1), for N-2, N2O, NO, CO2, and CH4, respectively). In some circumstances, the modified system measured significantly more N-2 and CO2 and less N2O and NO because of the enhanced measurement frequency. The modified system distinguished the differences in emissions of the denitrification gases and CO2 due to a 20% change in initial carbon supplies. It also remarkably recovered approximately 90% of consumed nitrate during incubation. These performances validate the technical improvement, and indicate that the improved GFSC system may provide a powerful research tool for obtaining deeper insights into the processes of soil carbon and nitrogen transformation during denitrification.

AB Crop residues may serve as a significant source of soil emissions of N2O and other trace gases. According to the emission factors (EFs) set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), N2O emission is proportional to the amount of N added by residues to the soil. However, the effects of crop residues on the source and sink strength of agroecosystems for trace gases are regulated by their properties, such as the C and N content; C/N ratio; lignin, cellulose, and soluble fractions; and residue humidity. In the present study, an automated dynamic chamber method was used in combination with soil mesocosms to simultaneously measure the effects of nine different crop residues (oilseed rape, winter wheat, field pea, maize, potato, mustard, red clover, sugar beet, and iyegrass) on soil respiration (CO2) and reactive N fluxes (N2O, NO, and NH3 at a high temporal resolution. Specifically, crop residues were incorporated in the 0-4 cm topsoil layer and incubated for 60 days at a constant temperature (15 degrees C) and water-filled pore space (60% WFPS). Residue incorporation immediately and sharply increased soil N2O and CO2 emissions, but these were short-lived and returned to background levels within respectively 10 and 30 days. The magnitude of increase in soil NO flux following residue incorporation was lower than that in CO2 and N2O fluxes, with peak emissions observed around day 20. Overall, the N content or C/N ratio of the applied residue could not sufficiently explain the variation in soil N2O and NO emissions. The range of the calculated N2O EFs over a 60-day period was -0.17 to +45, being wider than that proposed by the IPCC -0.01 to +1.1). Therefore, the residue maturity stage may be used as a simple proxy to estimate the N2O + NO emissions from incorporated residue. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Drying and rewetting of soils triggers a cascade of physical, chemical, and biological processes; understanding these responses to varying moisture levels becomes increasingly important in the context of changing precipitation patterns. When soils dry and water content decreases, diffusion is limited and substrates can accumulate. Upon rewetting, these substrates are mobilized and can energize hot moments of intense biogeochemical cycling, leading to pulses of trace gas emissions. Until recently, it was difficult to follow the rewetting dynamics of nutrient cycling in the field without physically disturbing the soil. Here we present a study that combines real-time trace gas measurements with high-resolution measurements of diffusive nutrient fluxes in intact soils. Our goal was to distinguish the contribution of different inorganic and organic nitrogen (N) forms to the rewetting substrate flush and the production of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Diffusive flux of N-bearing substrates (NO2-, NO3-, NHS and amino acids) was determined in situ in hourly resolution using a microdialysis approach. We conducted an irrigation experiment in a semi-arid California grassland at the end of the dry season, and followed soil N flux and N trace gas emissions over the course of 30 h post-wetting. Upon rewetting, both inorganic and organic N diffused through the soil, with inorganic N contributing most to the rewetting N flush. Emissions of NO and N2O rapidly increased and remained elevated for the duration of our measurements, whereas diffusive soil N flux was characterized by large temporal variation. Immediately after rewetting, NO3- contributed 80% to the total diffusive N flux but was consumed rapidly, possibly due to fast microbial uptake or denitrification. Ammonium flux contributed only similar to 10% to the initial diffusive N flux, but it dominated total N diffusion 27 h post-wetting, coinciding with peak N-gas emissions. This suggests nitrification may control most of the N trace gases produced during the late stages of a rewetting pulse. Nitrite contributed only 1% to total N diffusion and did not show a clear temporal pattern. Amino acids contributed roughly as much as NH4+ to the initial diffusive N flux, but the organic N pulse was short-lived, indicating that organic N did not contribute substantially to N-gas formation shortly after rewetting at our study site. Our results support the hypothesis that in semi-arid environments N-bearing substrates concentrate during dry periods and, upon rewetting, can lead to pulses of NO and N2O when they react chemically or are transformed by microorganisms.

AB A 3-year field experiment (October 2004-October 2007) was conducted to quantify N2O fluxes and determine the regulating factors from rain-fed, N fertilized wheat-maize rotation in the Sichuan Basin, China.
   Static chamber-GC techniques were used to measure soil N2O fluxes in three treatments (three replicates per treatment): CK (no fertilizer); N150 (300 kg N fertilizer ha(-1) yr(-1) or 150 kg N ha(-1) per crop); N250 (500 kg N fertilizer ha(-1) yr(-1) kg or 250 kg N ha(-1) per crop). Nitrate (NO (3) (-) ) leaching losses were measured at nearby sites using free-drained lysimeters.
   The annual N2O fluxes from the N fertilized treatments were in the range of 1.9 to 6.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) corresponding to an N2O emission factor ranging from 0.12 % to 1.06 % (mean value: 0.61 %). The relationship between monthly soil N2O fluxes and NO (3) (-) leaching losses can be described by a significant exponential decaying function.
   The N2O emission factor obtained in our study was somewhat lower than the current IPCC default emission factor (1 %). Nitrate leaching, through removal of topsoil NO (3) (-) , is an underrated regulating factor of soil N2O fluxes from cropland, especially in the regions where high NO (3) (-) leaching losses occur.

AB The factors controlling nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions after fertilizer nitrogen (N) applications are well studied. This information can be used to choose appropriate fertilizer sources and placement methods in order to minimize direct fertilizer-induced N2O emissions in cropping systems. Several field experiments have shown that locally concentrated, alkaline-forming fertilizers, such as anhydrous ammonia or subsurface banded urea, in soil produce more N2O than evenly dispersed fertilizers. Nitrification inhibitors lower N2O emissions, but fertilizers employing a physical barrier to control the release of plant-available N are not always effective in this respect. Adding the global warming potential from fertilizer production and field application can shift the overall greenhouse gas emissions among fertility practices depending on the fertilizer type being used. The research findings presented in this review and greater knowledge about the pathways of N2O production will aid in providing better informed choices of N source and placement method in cropping systems.

AB Biogenic fluxes from soil at a local and regional scale are crucial to study air pollution and climate. Here we present field measurements of soil fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) observed over four different land cover types, i.e. bare soil, grassland, maize field, and forest, at an inland rural site in Benin, West Africa, during the DACCIWA field campaign in June and July 2016. At the regional scale, urbanization and a massive growth in population in West Africa have been causing a strong increase in anthropogenic emissions. Anthropogenic pollutants are transported inland and northward from the megacities located on the coast, where the reaction with biogenic emissions may lead to enhanced ozone production outside urban areas, as well as secondary organic aerosol formation, with detrimental effects on humans, animals, natural vegetation, and crops. We observe NO fluxes up to 48.05 ngN m(-2) s(-1). NO fluxes averaged over all land cover types are 4.79 +/- 5.59 ngN m(-2) s(-1), and maximum soil emissions of NO are recorded over bare soil. NH3 is dominated by deposition for all land cover types. NH3 fluxes range between -6.59 and 4.96 ngN m(-2) s(-1). NH3 fluxes averaged over all land cover types are -0.91 +/- 1.27 ngN m(-2) s(-1), and maximum NH3 deposition is measured over bare soil. The observations show high spatial variability even for the same soil type, same day, and same meteorological conditions. We compare point daytime average measurements of NO emissions recorded during the field campaign with those simulated by GEOS-Chem (Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Model) for the same site and find good agreement. In an attempt to quantify NO emissions at the regional and national scale, we also provide a tentative estimate of total NO emissions for the entire country of Benin for the month of July using two distinct methods: upscaling point measurements and using the GEOS-Chem model. The two methods give similar results: 1.17 +/- 0.6 and 1.44 GgN month(-1), respectively. Total NH3 deposition estimated by upscaling point measurements for the month of July is 0.21 GgN month(-1).

AB While emissions of nitric oxide (NO), ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from grassland soils have been increasingly well constrained, soil dinitrogen (N-2) emissions are poorly understood. However, N-2 losses might dominate total gaseous nitrogen (N) losses. Knowledge on N losses is key for the development of climate-adapted management that balances agronomic and environmental needs. Hence, we quantified all gaseous N losses from a montane grassland in Southern Germany both for ambient climatic conditions and for a climate change treatment (+2 degrees C MAT, -300mm MAP). Monthly measurements of soil N-2 emissions of intact soil cores revealed that those exceeded by far soil N2O emissions and averaged at 350 +/- 101 (ambient climate) and 738 +/- 197 mu gN m(-2) h(-1) (climate change). Because these measurements did not allow to quantify emission peaks after fertilization, an additional laboratory experiment was deployed to quantify the response of NH3, NO, N2O, and N-2 emissions in sub daily temporal resolution to a typical slurry fertilization event (51kgN ha(-1)). Our results revealed that total N gas losses amounted to roughly half of applied slurry-N. Surprisingly, N-2 but not NH3 dominated fertilizer N losses, with N-2 emissions accounting for 16-21kg or 31-42% of the applied slurry-N, while NH3 volatilization (3.5kg), N2O (0.2-0.5kg) and NO losses (0-0.2kg) were of minor importance. Though constraining annual N-2 loss remained uncertain due to high spatiotemporal variability of fluxes, we show that N-2 losses are a so far overlooked key component of the N balance in montane grasslands, which needs to be considered for developing improved grassland management strategies targeted at increasing N use efficiency.

AB Soil emission of nitric oxide may be a significant source of NOx in rural areas. Agricultural practices may enhance these emissions by addition of nitrogen fertilizers,A system that enables continuous measurement of NO fluxes from agricultural surfaces using the flux-gradient method was developed. Hourly differences in NO concentrations in air sampled at two intake heights (0.6 and 1 m) were determined using a chemiluminescence analyzer. Eddy diffusivities were determined using wind profiles (cup anemometers), and stability corrections calculated using a 5 cm path sonic anemometer. Fast switching of sampling between air intake heights (every 30 s) and determination of concentration values at a frequency of 2 Hz minimized the errors due to fluctuations in background concentration. Low travel times for air samples in the tubing (similar to 8 s) were estimated to result in small errors in flux values (<0.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) due to chemical reactions. The overall resolution of the system was estimated as similar to 1 ng N m(-2) s(-1). NO fluxes from a bare soil were measured quasi-continuously from January to June 1995 at Elora, Canada, comprising a total of 1833 hourly values. Daily NO fluxes before nitrogen fertilization were small, increasing after nitrogen fertilizer was added (>10 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) Monthly NO fluxes estimated were similar to those observed in previous studies. The designed system could be easily modified to measure NOx and NO fluxes by using an additional chemiluminescence analyzer. The system also could be adapted to measure fluxes sequentially from various plots, enabling testing of agricultural practices on NO emissions.

AB Animal manures from intensive livestock operations can be pelleted to improve handlings and recyclings of embodied nutrients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of pelleted poultry manure on N2O and NO fluxes from an Andisol field. In autumn 2006 and summer 2007, poultry manure (PM), pelleted poultry manure (PP), and chemical fertilizer (CF) were applied at a rate of 120 kg N ha(-1) in each cultivation period to Komatsuna (Brossica rapa var. peruviridis). Nitrous oxide and NO fluxes were measured using an automated monitoring system. A soil incubation experiment was also conducted to determine the influence of intact and ground pelleted manure on N2O, NO. and CO2 production with a water-filled pore space (WFPS) of 30 or 50%. In the field measurements, N2O emission rates from the organic fertilizer treatments were larger than that from the CIF treatment. possibly because organic C stimulated denitrification. The highest N2O flux was observed from the PP treatment after a rainfall following fertilization, and the cumulative emission rate (2.72 +/- 0.22 kg N ha(-1) Y-1) was 3.9 and 7.1 times that from the PM and CIF treatments, respectively. In contrast, NO emission rates were highest from the CIF treatment. The NO/N2O flux ratio indicated that nitrification was the dominant process for NO and N2O production from the CF treatment. Cumulative N2O emission rates from all treatments were generally higher during the wetter cultivation period (autumn 2006) than during the drier cultivation period (summer 2007). In contrast, NO emission rates were higher in the drier than in the wetter cultivation period. The incubation experiment results showed a synergistic effect of soil moisture and the pelleted manure form on N2O emission rates. The intact pelleted manure with the 50% WFPS treatment produced the highest N2O and CO2 fluxes and resulted in the lowest soil NO3- content after the incubation. These results indicate that anaerobic conditions inside the pellets, caused by rainfall and heterotrophic microbial activities, led to denitrification, resulting in high N2O fluxes. Controlling the timing of N application by avoiding wet conditions might be one mitigation option to reduce N2O emission rates from the PP treatment in this study field. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fine root dynamics have the potential to contribute significantly to ecosystem-scale biogeochemical cycling, including the production and emission of greenhouse gases. This is particularly true in tropical forests which are often characterized as having large fine root biomass and rapid rates of root production and decomposition. We examined patterns in fine root dynamics on two soil types in a lowland moist Amazonian forest, and determined the effect of root decay on rates of C and N trace gas fluxes. Root production averaged 229 (+/-35) and 153 (+/-27) g m(-2) yr(-1) for years 1 and 2 of the study, respectively, and did not vary significantly with soil texture. Root decay was sensitive to soil texture with faster rates in the clay soil (k=-0.96 year(-1)) than in the sandy loam soil (k=-0.61 year(-1)), leading to greater standing stocks of dead roots in the sandy loam. Rates of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were significantly greater in the clay soil (13+/-1 ng N cm(-2) h(-1)) than in the sandy loam (1.4+/-0.2 ng N cm(-2) h(-1)). Root mortality and decay following trenching doubled rates of N2O emissions in the clay and tripled them in sandy loam over a 1-year period. Trenching also increased nitric oxide fluxes, which were greater in the sandy loam than in the clay. We used trenching (clay only) and a mass balance approach to estimate the root contribution to soil respiration. In clay soil root respiration was 264-380 g C m(-2) yr(-1), accounting for 24% to 35% of the total soil CO2 efflux. Estimates were similar using both approaches. In sandy loam, root respiration rates were slightly higher and more variable (521+/-206 g C m(2) yr(-1)) and contributed 35% of the total soil respiration. Our results show that soil heterotrophs strongly dominate soil respiration in this forest, regardless of soil texture. Our results also suggest that fine root mortality and decomposition associated with disturbance and land-use change can contribute significantly to increased rates of nitrogen trace gas emissions.

AB Soil-emitted nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) in crop production are harmful nitrogen (N) emissions that may contribute both directly and indirectly to global warming. Application of nitrification inhibitors, such as dicyandiamide (DCD), and urea deep placement (UDP), are considered effective approaches to reduce these emissions. This study investigated the effects of DCD and UDP, compared to urea and potassium nitrate, on emissions, nitrogen use efficiency and grain yields under direct-seeded rice. High-frequency measurements of N2O and NO emissions were conducted using the automated closed chamber method throughout the crop-growing season and during the ratoon crop. Both UDP and DCD were effective in reducing N2O emissions by 95% and 73%, respectively. The highest emission factor (1.53% of applied N) was observed in urea, while the lowest was in UDP (0.08%). Emission peaks were mainly associated with fertilization events and appeared within one to two weeks of fertilization. Those emission peaks contributed to 65%-98% of the total seasonal emissions. Residual effects of fertilizer treatments on the N2O emissions from the ratoon crop were not significant; however, the urea treatment contributed 2%, whereas UDP contributed to 44% of the total annual emissions. On the other hand, cumulative NO emissions were not significant in either the rice or ratoon crops. UDP and DCD increased grain yields by 16%-19% and N recovery efficiency by 30%-40% over urea. The results suggested that the use of DCD and UDP could mitigate N2O emissions and increase grain yields and nitrogen use efficiency under direct-seeded rice condition.

AB The ammonia oxidation process driven by microorganisms is an essential source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. However, few evaluations have been performed on the changes in the community structure and abun-dance of soil ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) under substituting portion of chemical fertilizers with organic manure (organic substitution) and their relative contribution to the ammonia oxida-tion process. Here, five long-term fertilization strategies were applied in field (SN: synthetic fertilizer application; OM: organic manure; M1N1: substituting 50 % of chemical N fertilizer with organic manure; M1N4: substituting 20 % of chemical N fertilizer with organic manure; and CK: no fertilizer). We investigated the response characteristics of AOB and AOA community structures by selective inhibitor shaking assays and high-throughput sequencing and further explained their relative contribution to the ammonia oxidation process during three consecutive years of vegetable production. Compared to SN and M1N4, the potential of ammonia oxidation (PAO) was significantly reduced by 26.4 % and 22.3 % in OM and 9.5 % and 4.4 % in M1N1, resulting in N2O reductions of 38.9 % and 30.8 % (OM) and 31.2 % and 21.1 % (M1N1), respectively, and NO reductions of 45.0 % and 34.1 % (OM) and 40.1 % and 28.3 % (M1N1). RDA and correlation analyses showed that the soil organic carbon and ammonium nitrogen content increased while AOB gene abundance and diversity significantly decreased with increasing organic replacement ratio; however, the relative abundance of Nitrosomonas in AOB increased in OM and M1N1, which further demonstrates that AOB are the main driver in vegetable soils. Therefore, the appropriate proportion of organic substitution (OM and M1N1) could decrease the N2O and NO emissions contributed by AOB by affecting the soil physicochemical properties and AOB community structure.

AB Denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) and flux rates of nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen ((2)) were studied in DEA assays on soils treated with 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Nitrous oxide and N-2 fluxes were quantified by N-15 gas-flux method with no additional enzymatic inhibitors, thus, overcoming problems associated with the use of chloramphenicol and acetylene. The nitrification inhibitor DMPP did not affect DEA or the measured gas emissions even when applied in concentrations 14 times higher than the recommended concentration.

AB The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the effects of land use change on N oxide fluxes from soil in seasonally dry, eastern Amazonia and (2) evaluate the "hole-in-the-pipe" model in a field setting where N availability varies among land uses and soil moisture varies among seasons. We measured N oxide flux from an old-growth forest, a 20-year-old secondary forest, an active pasture, and a degraded pasture. We also measured soil water content, soil inorganic N stocks, net N mineralization and nitrification potential. To determine the effects of pasture age on N oxide flux, we measured gas fluxes at a chronosequence of pastures (0-13 years). In the land use study, N2O fluxes followed the order: primary forest (2.4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) > secondary forest (0.9 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) > active pasture (0.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) > degraded pasture (0.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), and NO fluxes followed the order: primary forest (1.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) > degraded pasture (0.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) 2 active pasture (0.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) 2 secondary forest (0.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). In the chronosequence study, no trend in N oxide emissions with pasture age was apparent, but emissions from pastures were lower than from the forest. Total N oxide flux correlated with a laboratory measure of nitrification potential (r(2) = 0.85). The ratio N2O:NO correlated with soil water content (r(2) = 0.56). Parameterization of the model accounted for variability in N oxide emissions across land uses and seasons and the model application revealed the importance of studying both N oxide gases simultaneously. Model predictions for six independent sites agreed well with observed fluxes, suggesting that the model may be applicable at a broader scale. The consistently low annual emissions of N2O estimated for all of the Amazonian pastures that we studied suggest that conversions of tropical forests to cattle pastures may not in the long term cause a significant increase in the contribution of soil emissions to atmospheric N2O or NO.

AB Nitrite (NO2 (-)) as an important intermediate of the biological nitrogen cycle is particularly reactive in acidic soils and acts as a source of N2O and NOx (NO and NO2). However, abiotic and biotic pathways of NO2 (-)-driven N2O and NOx production in forest soil and the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in these processes are still unclear. In this study, NO2 (-) was applied to both unsterile and sterilized soil samples as well as to different SOM fractions from a Norway spruce forest. Biotic and abiotic N2O emission was measured with an infrared absorption analyzer and gas chromatography, while NOx emission was quantified with a chemiluminescence analyzer. Isotopic signatures of N2O (delta N-15(bulk), delta O-18, and N-15-N2O site preference) were analyzed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. After NO2 (-) addition, a large amount of NOx was emitted immediately, while N2O emission occurred 15-60 min later and was much lower compared to NOx. Sterilization of soil decreased N2O emission significantly, but not NOx emission. The N-15 site preference of N2O ranged from 7.98 to 11.58aEuro degrees for abiotic and 4.69-7.42aEuro degrees for biotic sources. The fulvic acid fraction contributed the most to abiotic N2O emission, while the fastest NO and N2O emission occurred after NO2 (-)application to the humin fraction, followed by the humic acid fraction. These results are important for the future understanding of NOx and N2O sources, as well as the use of isotopic signatures for source-partitioning N2O emission from soil.

AB [1] Emissions of NO, NO2, and N2O to the atmosphere were measured with a fully automated laboratory system from undisturbed soil columns obtained from five different temperate and one boreal forest sites. The soils were chosen to cover a transect through Europe, sandy and loamy textures, and different atmospheric nitrogen deposition rates. In a two-factorial experimental design, soil cores were kept under varying conditions with respect to temperature (range 5 - 20degreesC) and soil moisture ( range 0 - 300 kPa). The combination of soil temperature and soil moisture could explain a better part of variations in NO (up to 74%) and N2O ( up to 86%) emissions for individual soils, but average emissions differed significantly between various forest soils. Generally, NO and N2O were emitted from all soils except from the boreal pine forest soil, where NO was consumed. NO emissions from the German spruce forest receiving highest yearly nitrogen inputs of > 35 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) ranged from 1.3 to 608.9 mug NO-N m(-2) h(-1) and largely exceeded emissions from other soils. Average N2O emissions from this soil tended also to be highest (171.7 +/- 42.2 mug N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)), but did not differ significantly from other soils. NO2 deposition occurred in all soils and strongly correlated to NO emissions. NO and N2O emissions showed a positive exponential relationship to soil temperature. With activation energies between 57 and 133 kJ mol(-1), N2O emissions from the various soils responded more uniformely to temperature than NO emissions with 41 and 199 kJ mol(-1). The two Austrian beech forest soils showed exceptionally high activation energies for NO emissions, which might be attributed to chemodenitrification. N2O emissions increased with increasing water filled pore space (WFPS) or decreasing water tension, respectively. Maximal N2O emissions were measured between 80 and 95% WFPS or 0 kPa water tension. Optimal moisture for NO emission differed significantly between the soils, and ranged between 15% WFPS in sandy Italian floodplain soil and 65% in loamy Austrian beech forest soils. These differences may be related to the specific adaptation of the microbial communities to draught conditions.

AB Due to the dense population, rapid industrialization, and intensified agricultural activities, some regions in Asia are hot spots of airborne nitrogen oxides and also areas with increasing nitrogen deposition. Therefore the cycling of nitrogen gases in Asia might be of increasing importance on both a regional and a global scale for atmospheric chemistry and budgets of nitrogen. Yet, to date, knowledge of soil NO emission is quite limited in Asia, particularly in forest ecosystems. In this study, soil NO emissions in two subtropical humid forests, a broadleaf forest in climax successional stage and a pine forest in primary successional stage, were measured throughout the year 2005 in Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, south China. In the broadleaf forest, mean NO emission in wet season (14.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) was lower than in dry season (23.8 ng N m(-2) s(-1)). In the pine forest, however, mean NO emission in wet season (17.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) was higher than in dry season (7.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1)). In both forests, soil water content was the dominant factor controlling the seasonal patterns of NO emissions, and soil NO emission was significantly correlated to percent water filled pore space (% WFPS) in a quadratic manner (p < 0.001). Annual NO emissions in the broadleaf forest and the pine forest were preliminarily estimated to be 6.1-6.9 and 4.0-4.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, by using three upscaling methods.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is a small highly diffusible gas and a ubiquitous bioactive molecule. Its chemical properties make NO a versatile signal molecule that functions through interactions with cellular targets via either redox or additive chemistry. In plants, NO plays a role in a broad spectrum of pathophysiological and developmental processes. Although nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-dependent NO production has been reported in plants, no gene, cDNA, or protein has been isolated to date. In parallel, precise and regulated NO production can be measured from the activity of the ubiquitous enzyme nitrate reductase (NR). In addition to endogenous NO formation, high NO emissions are observed from fertilized soils, but their effects on the physiology of plants are largely unknown. Many environmental and hormonal stimuli are transmitted either directly or indirectly by NO signaling cascades. The ability of NO to act simultaneously on several unrelated biochemical nodes and its redox homeostatic properties suggest that it might be a synchronizing molecule in plants.

AB NO and NO emissions from an Andisol maize field were studied. The experimental treatments were incorporation of urea into the plough layer at 250 kg N ha(-1) by two applications (U1250), band application of urea at a depth of 8 cm at 75 kg N ha(-1) plus incorporation of urea into the plough layer at 75 kg N ha(-1) (UB150), band application of polyolefin-coated urea at a depth of 5 cm at 150 kg N ha(-1) (CB150), and a control (without N application). N2O fluxes from U1250 and UB 150 peaked following the incorporation of supplementary fertilizer, and declined to the background level after that, while the NO flux from CB 150 was relatively low but remained at constant level until shortly after harvest. Accordingly, the total N2O emissions during the whole cultivation period from the three treatments were not significantly different. The fertilizer-derived N2O-N losses from U1250, UB150 and CB150 were 0.15%, 0.27% and 0.28% of the applied N, respectively. However, it was suggested that, due to the low plant N recovery, U1250 had a significantly larger potential for indirect N2O emission than the other treatments. On the other hand, NO emissions from U1250 and UB 150 were 12 times higher than that from CB 150, and the fertilizer-derived NO-N losses from the three treatments were 0.16%, 0.27% and 0.026% of the applied N, respectively. Significant NO fluxes were detected only when urea-N fertilizer was surface-applied and incorporated into plough-layer soil.

AB The use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture is a significant source of reactive nitrogen compounds for the atmosphere. Emissions of NO, NH3, and N2O were measured on irrigated maize fields, on acidic podzols, set up in a large pine tree forest system in the southwestern part of France. Measurements were carried out over a yearly period: before, during, and after fertilization. Trace gas emissions appear to be strongly linked to soil characteristics and to the type of fertilizer and application procedures used. All emissions are strongly enhanced after fertilizer application, although NO and N2O emissions are observed all year long. No emission was observed on forest soils which only constitute an atmospheric NO2 sink. The imbalance of the nitrogen budget (up to 100 kg N ha-1) might be explained by gaseous emissions into the atmosphere, watertable pollution by nitrate and ammonium ions remaining very low. This is one of the peculiarities of this agrosystem.

AB The forest litter layer lies at the boundary between soil and atmosphere and is a major factor in biogeochemical cycles. While there are several studies on how the litter layer controls soil trace gas emissions, litter emissions itself are less well understood, and it is still unclear how important gases respond to changing temperature and moisture. In order to assess leaf litter gas exchange, we conducted laboratory incubation experiments in which the full set of climate relevant gases, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and nitric oxide (NO) coming from deciduous and coniferous leaf litter were measured at five temperatures and seven moisture contents. In addition, we compared litter and soil from different origin in terms of temperature/moisture responses of gas fluxes and investigated possible interactions between the two climate factors. Deciduous litter emitted more CO2 (up to 335mg CO2-Ckg(-1)h(-1)) than coniferous litter, whereas coniferous litter released maximum amounts of NO (207 mu gNO-Nkg(-1)h(-1)). N2O was only emitted from litter under very moist and warm conditions (>70% wet weight, >10 degrees C). CH4 emissions were close to zero. Temperature sensitivities of litter emissions were generally lower than for soil emissions. Nevertheless, wet and warm conditions always enhanced litter emissions, suggesting a strong feedback effect of the litter layer to predicted future climate change.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas that also plays the primary role in stratospheric ozone depletion. The use of nitrogen fertilizers is known as the major reason for atmospheric N2O increase. Empirical bottom-up models therefore estimate agricultural N2O inventories using N loading as the sole predictor, disregarding the regional heterogeneities in soil inherent response to external N loading. Several environmental factors have been found to influence the response in soil N2O emission to N fertilization, but their interdependence and relative importance have not been addressed properly. Here, we show that soil pH is the chief factor explaining regional disparities in N2O emission, using a global meta-analysis of 1,104 field measurements. The emission factor (EF) of N2O increases significantly (p < .001) with soil pH decrease. The default EF value of 1.0%, according to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change) for agricultural soils, occurs at soil pH 6.76. Moreover, changes in EF with N fertilization (i.e. EF) is also negatively correlated (p < .001) with soil pH. This indicates that N2O emission in acidic soils is more sensitive to changing N fertilization than that in alkaline soils. Incorporating our findings into bottom-up models has significant consequences for regional and global N2O emission inventories and reconciling them with those from top-down models. Moreover, our results allow region-specific development of tailor-made N2O mitigation measures in agriculture.

AB Soil carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural working lands via soil amendments and management practices is considered a relatively well-tested and affordable approach for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Carbon farming provides useful benefits for soil health, biomass production, and crop resilience, but the effects of different soil C sequestration approaches on the nitrogen (N) cycle remain controversial. While some C farming practices have been shown to reduce N fertilizer use in some cases, C farming could also impose an unwanted "N penalty" through which soil C gains can only be maintained with additional N inputs, thereby increasing N losses to the environment. We systematically reviewed meta-analysis studies on the impacts of C farming on N cycling in agroecosystems and estimated the cumulative effect of several C farming practices on N cycling. We found that, on average, combined C farming practices significantly reduced nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching from soils, thus inferring both N cycling and climate change benefits. In addition to more widely studied C farming practices that generate organic C, we also discuss silicate rock additions, which offer a pathway to inorganic C sequestration that does not require additional N inputs, framing important questions for future research.

AB Emissions of reactive N compounds produced during terrestrial N cycling can be an important N loss pathway from ecosystems. Most measurements of this process focus on NO and N2O efflux; however, in alkaline soils such as those in the Mojave Desert, NH3 production can be an important component of N gas loss. We investigated patterns of NO and NH3 emissions in the Mojave Desert and identified seasonal changes in temperature, precipitation and spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrients as primary controllers of soil efflux. Across all seasons, NH3 dominated reactive N gas emissions with fluxes ranging from 0.9 to 10 ng N m(-2) s(-1) as compared to NO fluxes of 0.08-1.9 ng N m(-2) s(-1). Fluxes were higher in April and July than in October; however, a fall precipitation event yielded large increases in both NO and NH3 efflux. To explore the mechanisms driving field observations, we combined NO and NH3 soil flux measurements with laboratory manipulations of temperature, water and nutrient conditions. These experiments showed a large transient NH3 pulse (similar to 70-100 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) following water addition, presumably driven by an increase in soil NH4+ concentrations. This was followed by an increase in NO production, with maximum NO flux rates of 34 ng N m(-2) s(-1). Our study suggests that immediately following water addition NH3 volatilization proceeds at high rates due to the absence of microbial competition for NH4+; during this period N gas loss is insensitive to changes in temperature and soil nutrients. Subsequently, NO emission increases and rates of both NO and NH3 emission are sensitive to temperature and nutrient constraints on microbial activity. Addition of labile C reduces gaseous N losses, presumably by increasing microbial immobilization, whereas addition of NO3- stimulates NO and NH3 efflux.

AB Nitrogen (N) fertilizers have substantially increased global crop yields around the world during recent decades. Nevertheless, the extensive use of N fertilizers at global scale has converted agricultural fertilized soils into an important anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx). The application of enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers, with the addition of urease and nitrification inhibitors (UI and NI, respectively), facilitates the reduction of N2O and NOx emissions and the improvement of agronomic responses.
   Despite the fact that soil N2O emissions have been widely studied under a large variety of climatic conditions and with different enhanced-efficiency N fertilizer, few studies have focused on soil NOx emissions, particularly in high temperature environments. The main aim of this study, therefore, was the quantification of NO and NO2 fluxes at a high temporal resolution using an automatic measurement system with the capacity to evaluate 5 different treatments with three replicates, and the ambient gas concentration. In addition, N2O emissions were measured with the static chamber method. With respect to the urea (U) treatment, the results confirm a significant mitigation of N2O and NO losses with the use of the new experimental inhibitor, DMPSA, alone or combined with the urease inhibitor NBPT. Overall, NOx emissions decreased by more than 60% in all the treatments in which synthetic inhibitors (both UI and NI) were applied, while N2O emissions were reduced by more than 35% in all the fertilized treatments when compared with urea alone.
   The high temporal resolution allowed the observation of negative fluxes of NO and NO2 in the different treatments, although these were more frequent and intense in the U + NI treatment. In general, grain and biomass yield were not affected by the use of NI or UI. The combined result was that a substantial reduction of yield-scaled-N2O and yield-scaled-NOx emissions was obtained when these inhibitors were used with urea and, therefore, their use should be recommended for mitigating these emissions whilst maintaining yields.

AB Emissions of nitric and nitrous oxide (NO and N2O) from agricultural soils may have several consequences, including impacts on local tropospheric and global stratospheric chemistry. Elevated NO and N2O emissions following application of anhydrous ammonia to an agricultural field in California were driven by the biological generation of nitrite (NO2.) and subsequent abiotic decomposition of nitrous acid (HNO2). Maximum fluxes of > 1000 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1) and > 400 ng N2O-N cm(-2) h(-1) were observed, and emissions of > 1000 ng NO-N cm(-2) h(-1) and > 50 ng N2O-N cm(-2) h(-1) persisted for > 4 weeks. Laboratory experiments were performed to determine race coefficients and activation energies for HNO2-mediated NO and N2O production. Kinetic parameters describing the conversion of NO to N2O were measured and were found to vary with water-filled pore space (WFPS). Regression models incorporating HNO2, WFPS, and temperature accounted for 75-77 % of the variability in field fluxes. A previously developed NO emissions model was modified to incorporate a kinetic expression for HNO2- and temperature-dependent production. The model tended to underestimate fluxes under low-flux conditions and overestimate fluxes under high-flux conditions, These data indicate that (1) control of acidity may be an effective means for minimizing gaseous N losses from fertilized soils and possibly for improving air quality in rural areas, (2) the transformation of HNO2-derived NO may be an important mechanism of N2O production even under relatively aerobic conditions, and (3) mechanistic models which account for spatial heterogeneity and transient conditions may be required to better predict field NO fluxes.

AB Geothermal areas can be local sources of greenhouse gases, both directly from the geothemral system or because of soil warming effects on biological sources. In this study we repeated field measurements methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes along the soil temperature (T-s) gradient in a Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) stand at the FoHlot study site in southern Iceland, where geothermal soil warming had started eight years earlier. We complemented these results with in situ measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and topsoil sampled in the same plots to study the production rates of those gases at 20 degrees C in the laboratory, as well as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO). We showed that the eight year long exposure to elevated T-s had changed the topsoil, including its microbial properties and the production potentials of these gases. However, the production rates of CO2, CH4 and N2O measured in laboratory conditions did not clearly follow the in situ fluxes. We discuss both adaptation of microbes and origin of greenhouse gases (depth patterns and microbial vs. geothermal sources) as possible reasons for these discrepancies.

AB Increasing greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic activities continue to be a mounting problem worldwide. In the semi-natural Miscanthus sinensis Andersson; grasslands of Aso, Kumamoto, Japan, which have been managed for thousands of years, we measured soil methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions before and after annual controlled burns. We estimated annual soil carbon (C) accumulation, and CH4 and N2O emissions induced by biomass burning in 2009 and 2010, to determine the impacts of this ecosystem and its management on global warming. Environmental factors affecting soil CH4 and N2O fluxes were unknown, with no effect of annual burning observed on short-term soil CH4 and N2O emissions. However, deposition of charcoal during burning may have enhanced CH4 oxidation and N2O consumption at the study site, given that emissions (CH4: -4.33kgCha(-1) yr(-1), N2O: 0.17kgNha(-1) yr(-1)) were relatively lower than those measured in other land-use types. Despite significant emission of CH4 and N2O during yearly burning events in early spring, the M. sinensis semi-natural grassland had a large annual soil C accumulation, which resulted in a global warming potential of -4.86 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1). Consequently, our results indicate that long-term maintenance of semi-natural M. sinensis grasslands by annual burning can contribute to the mitigation of global warming.

AB Soil biogenic NO emission is one of the most important sources of atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx) worldwide. However, the estimation of soil source, especially in arid areas presents large uncertainties because of the substantial lack of measurements. In this study, we selected the Ruoqiang oases on the southeastern edge of the Taklimakan Desert, China as the study area and applied Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 retrievals (DOMINO v2.0, 2005-2011) to investigate the spatial distribution and seasonal variations in tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD). High NO2 VCDs were observed over the oases (farmlands and natural vegetation), with the highest value obtained during summer, and lowest during winter. Pulses were observed during spring. We conducted in-situ measurements in June 2011 in Milan oasis and employed ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments to validate satellite NO2 retrievals. The findings are as follows: 1) in the study area soil biogenic NO emission is the dominant source of tropospheric NO2; 2) oases (farmlands) are hotspots of tropospheric NO2, and a higher increase in tropospheric NO2 is found in oases from winter to summer; and 3) enhancement of soil biogenic NO emission due to soil managements is predictable. Given the rapid agricultural development in the southern Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, researches on soil biogenic NO emission and increase in tropospheric NOx should be given more importance.

AB Soil moisture changes, arising from seasonal variation or from global climate changes, could influence soil nitrogen (N) transformation rates and N availability in unfertilized subtropical forests. A (15) N dilution study was carried out to investigate the effects of soil moisture change (30-90 % water-holding capacity (WHC)) on potential gross N transformation rates and N2O and NO emissions in two contrasting (broad-leaved vs. coniferous) subtropical forest soils. Gross N mineralization rates were more sensitive to soil moisture change than gross NH4 (+) immobilization rates for both forest soils. Gross nitrification rates gradually increased with increasing soil moisture in both forest soils. Thus, enhanced N availability at higher soil moisture values was attributed to increasing gross N mineralization and nitrification rates over the immobilization rate. The natural N enrichment in humid subtropical forest soils may partially be due to fast N mineralization and nitrification under relatively higher soil moisture. In broad-leaved forest soil, the high N2O and NO emissions occurred at 30 % WHC, while the reverse was true in coniferous forest soil. Therefore, we propose that there are different mechanisms regulating N2O and NO emissions between broad-leaved and coniferous forest soils. In coniferous forest soil, nitrification may be the primary process responsible for N2O and NO emissions, while in broad-leaved forest soil, N2O and NO emissions may originate from the denitrification process.

AB Annual nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from high-altitude alpine meadow grasslands have not been effectively characterized because of the scarcity of whole-year measurements. The authors performed a year-round measurement of N2O fluxes from three conventionally grazed alpine meadows that represent the typical meadow landscape in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The results showed that annual N2O emissions averaged 0.123 +/- 0.053 (2SD, i.e., the double standard deviation indicating the 95% confidence interval) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) across the three meadow sites. N2O flux pulses during the spring freezing-thawing period (FTP) were observed at only one site, indicating a large spatial variability in association with soil moisture differences. Approximately 34-57% (mean: 46%) of the annual N2O emissions occurred in the non-growing season, highlighting the substantial importance of accurate flux observations during this period. The simultaneous observations showed conservative, marginal nitric oxide (NO) fluxes of 0.058 +/- 0.032 (2SD) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The N2O fluxes across the three field sites correlated negatively with the soil nitrate concentrations during the entire year-round period (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a significant joint regulatory effect of topsoil temperature and moisture on the N2O and NO fluxes was observed during the relatively warm periods. Based on the results of the present and previous studies, a simple extrapolation roughly estimated the annual total N2O emission from Chinese grasslands to be 73 +/- 15 (2SD) Gg N yr(-1) (1 Gg = 10(9) g). A linear dependence of the annual N2O fluxes on the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was also found. This result may provide a simple approach for estimating the N2O emission inventories of frigid alpine or temperate grasslands that are ungrazed either in the summer or year round. However, further confirmation of this relationship with a wider ANPP range is still needed in the future studies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from farmland is a concern for both environmental quality and agricultural productivity. Field experiments were conducted in 1996-1997 to assess soil N2O emissions as affected by timing of N fertilizer application and straw/tillage practices for crop production under irrigation in southern Alberta. The crops were soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 1996 and canola (Brassica napus L.) in 1997. Nitrous oxide flux from soil was measured using a vented chamber technique and calculated from the increase in concentration with time. Nitrous oxide fluxes for all treatments varied greatly during the year, with the greatest fluxes occurring in association with freeze-thaw events during March and April. Emissions were greater when N fertilizer (100 kg N ha(-1)) was applied in the fall compared to spring application. Straw removal at harvest in the fall increased N2O emissions when N fertilizer was applied in the fall, but decreased emissions when no fertilizer was applied. Fall plowing also increased N2O emissions compared to spring plowing or direct seeding. The study showed that N2O emissions may be minimized by applying N fertilizer in spring, retaining straw, and incorporating it in spring. The estimates of regional N2O emissions based on a fixed proportion of applied N may be tenuous since N2O emission varied widely depending on straw and fertilizer management practices.

AB When faced with a shortage of oxygen, many bacterial species use nitrate to support respiration via the process of denitrification. This takes place extensively in nitrogen-rich soils and generates the gaseous products nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N-2). The denitrifying bacteria protect themselves from the endogenous cytotoxic NO produced by converting it to N2O, which can be released into the atmosphere. However, N2O is a potent greenhouse gas and hence the activity of the enzyme that breaks down N2O has a crucial role in restricting its atmospheric levels. Here, we review the current understanding of the process by which N2O is produced and destroyed and discuss the potential for feeding this into new approaches for combating N2O release.

AB Acetylene, dimethyl ether (DME) and 2-chloro-6-trichloromethyl pyridine (nitrapyrin) were used as inhibitors to study the contributions of nitrification and denitrification to the production of N2O and nitric oxide (NO) in samples taken from the soil profile of a peatland drained for forestry. Acetylene and DME inhibited 60-100% of the nitrification activity in field-moist samples from the 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm peat layers, whereas nitrapyrin had no inhibitory effect. In the 0-5 cm peat layer the N2O production could be reduced by up to 90% with inhibitors of nitrification, but in the 5-10 cm peat layer this proportion was 20-30%. All the inhibitors removed 96-100% of the nitrification potential in peat-water slurries from the 0-5 cm peat layer, but the 5-10 cm layer had a much lower nitrification activity, and here the efficiency of the inhibitors was more variable. Litter was the main net source of NO in the peat profile. NO3- production was lower in the litter layer than in the peat, whereas N2O production was much higher in the litter than in the peat. Denitrification was the most probable source of N2O and NO in the litter, which had a high availability of organic substrates.

AB Trace gas exchange of N2O, NO, and CO2 between soil and the atmosphere was measured with high temporal resolution for 5 years (2004-2008) at the Hoglwald Forest, Germany, using a fully automated measuring system. On the basis of these long-term continuous measurements, we calculated the annual budgets of soil-atmosphere trace gas exchange with high accuracy and demonstrated substantial seasonal and interannual variations. The mean annual soil-atmosphere exchange of N2O, NO, and CO2 at our site for the years 2004-2008 was 1.20 +/- 0.09 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1), 8.64 +/- 0.19 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1), and 7.15 +/- 0.08 t CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Seasonal patterns of soil N2O fluxes were characterized by event emissions, generally occurring during thawing after longer freezing periods. In contrast to N2O emissions, the seasonal patterns of NO and CO2 soil-atmosphere exchange followed soil temperature changes, although a substantial increase in CO2 emissions was also observed during the freeze and thaw periods. The fact that NO fluxes were higher than N2O emissions during most of the entire observation period indicated that nitrification might have been the primary pathway of N-trace gas production in our study. The extremely high N2O emissions and the substantial interannual variation of N2O flux rates caused by the freeze and thaw effect demonstrate the need for long-term measurements with high temporal resolution in order to come up with more reliable estimates of soil-atmosphere trace fluxes.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is a relatively short-lived trace gas that reacts with oxygen in the troposphere to produce the air pollutant ozone. It also reacts with water vapor to form nitric and nitrous acids, which acidify precipitation and increase N deposition. Models currently used to predict soil NO fluxes are based on the assumption that NO flux is proportional to the gross rate of nitrification or N mineralization; however, this assumption has not been tested because of the difficulty in measuring gross N-cycling rates in situ. We measured soil NO fluxes, gross and net N-cycling rates, and a variety of other soil characteristics in the forest floor and intact soil cores at nine undisturbed forest and rangeland ecosystems of New Mexico, Utah, and Oregon, USA, to determine which soil variables were most closely related to soil NO flux. Soil NO fluxes ranged from a low of 0.02 ng N.m(-1).s(-1), prior to wetting in a western hemlock-sitka spruce forest on the Ore-on coast, to a high of 6.74 ng N.m(-2).s(-1), one hour after soil wetting in a juniper woodland of central Oregon. In contrast to our expectations, neither gross nitrification nor gross mineralization was correlated with soil NO flux. Fluxes were positively correlated with net rates of mineralization and nitrification, soil NO3 concentrations, bulk density, and pH. and negatively correlated with gross rates of NO3 consumption in the forest floor, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil C:N, and soil water content. Principal-componeflt analysis showed that NO flux after water addition (2 cm of water) had a strong negative correlation with microbial demand for N (as indicated by net mineralization, net nitrification, SOC, and C:N). Our results suggest that, even in well-drained soils, NO efflux is limited more by NO consumption than by NO production. As a result, models utilizing the more easily measured net rates. rather than,ross rates, may be better predictors of soil NO fluxes across a range of ecosystems.

AB After implementation of legislative measures for the reduction of environmental hazards from nitrate leaching and ammonia volatilisation when using organic manures and fertilizers in Europe, much attention is now paid to the specific effects of these fertilizers on the dynamics of global warming-relevant trace gases in soil. Particularly nitrogen fertilizers and slurTy from animal husbandry are known to play a key role for the CH(4) and N(2)O fluxes from soils. Here we report on a short-term evaluation of trace gas fluxes in grassland as affected by single or combined application of mineral fertilizer and organic manure in early spring. Methane fluxes were characterised by a short methane emission event immediately after application of cattle slurry. Within the same day methane fluxes returned to negative, and on average over the 4-day period after slurTy application, only a small but insignificant trend to reduced methane oxidation was found. Nitrous oxide emissions showed a pronounced effect of combined slurry and mineral fertilizer application. In particular fresh cattle slurry combined with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) mineral fertilizer induced an increase in mean N20 flux during the first 4 days after application from 10 to 300 mu g N(2)O-N m(-2) h(-1). (15)N analysis of emitted N(2)O from (15)N-labelled fertilizer or manure indicated that easily decomposable slurry C compounds induced a pronounced promotion of N(2)O-N emission derived from mineral CAN fertilizer. Fluxes after application of either mineral fertilizer or slurry alone showed an increase of less than 5-fold. The NO(x) sink strength of the soil was in the range of -6 to -10 mu g NO(x)-N m(-2) h(-1) and after fertilization it showed a tendency to be reduced by no more than 2 mu g NO(x)-N m(-2) h(-1), which was a result of both, increased NO emission and slightly increased NO(2) deposition. Associated determination of the N(2)O:N(2) emission ratio revealed that after mineral N application (CAN) a large proportion (c. 50 %) was emitted as N(2)O, while after application of slurry with easily decomposable C and predominantly NH(4)(+)-N serving as N-source, the N(2)O:N(2) emission ratio was 1:14, i.e. was changed in favour of N2. Our work provides evidence that particularly the combination of slurry and nitrate-containing N fertilizers gives rise to considerable N20 emissions from mineral fertilizer N pool.

AB Nitrogen fertilizer application is accompanied by intense release of multiple reactive nitrogen (Nr) gases such as nitrous acid (HONO), ammonia (NH3), and nitric oxide (NO) from the soil, influencing atmospheric chemistry and air pollution. In current emission inventories, postfertilization soil emissions are poorly characterized due to inaccurate identification of fertilization timing and location. Moreover, pre-existing studies predominantly focus on individual Nr gases, and a comprehensive understanding of simultaneously emitted Nr gases from fertilization and their impacts on air quality is still limited. Here, we developed a novel method to identify the dryland fertilization activity based on satellite and reanalysis data sets. Then, we updated a dynamic soil Nr emissions model (WRF-SoilN-Chem) with lab-derived parametrization and applied it to analyze the time- and space-varying Nr emissions and their effects on air quality. It is estimated that the Nr emissions from a typical fertilization event in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region increased ozone (O3) and nitrate concentrations by 2.5 and 18.2%, respectively. HONO and NH3 emissions jointly enhanced nitrate production via gas-particle partitioning. An accurate representation of fertilization and meteorology-emission-chemistry coupled modeling would greatly improve the understanding of the soil Nr emissions and their impacts on regional air pollution.

AB Soils are considered as an important source for NO emissions, but the uncertainty in quantifying these emissions worldwide remains large due to the lack of field experiments and high variability in time and space of environmental parameters influencing NO emissions. In this study, the development of a relationship for NO flux emission from soil with pertinent environmental parameters is proposed. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to find the best non-linear regression between NO fluxes and seven environmental variables, introduced step by step: soil surface temperature, surface water filled pore space, soil temperature at depth (20-30 cm), fertilisation rate, sand percentage in the soil, pH and wind speed. The network performance is evaluated each time a new variable is introduced in the network, i. e. each variable is justified and evaluated in improving the network performance. A resulting equation linking NO flux from soil and the seven variables is proposed, and shows to perform well with measurements (R-2 = 0.71), whereas other regression models give a poor correlation coefficient between calculation and measurements (R-2 <= 0.12 for known algorithms used at regional or global scales). ANN algorithm is shown to be a good alternative between biogeochemical and large-scale models, for future application at regional scale.

AB Selection and management of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers, including nitrification inhibitors, are considered an effective strategy to mitigate N oxide emissions, but depends strongly on soil characteristics and climatic conditions. We evaluated the effect of the use of a nitrification inhibitor (2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA)) or splitting calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) on the N oxides and CH4 emissions, yield, N use efficiency (NUE) and bread-making quality in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop. During a typical rainfall cropping season, neither splitting CAN nor using DMPSA reduced significantly the area-scaled or yield-scaled emissions in comparison to a single application of CAN without inhibitors. This could be explained by the low emissions in CAN amended plots. Conversely, in the subsequent extremely dry cropping season, higher N oxide peaks occurred after soil rewetting and the effectiveness of DMPSA was significant in these conditions (e.g. 83% mitigation for NO). No improvement in the NUE, yield or bread-making quality was achieved with a split application or DMPSA added to the fertilizer. Under the conditions of the study, splitting CAN should not be recommended from a yield-scaled emissions viewpoint, while the use of DMPSA may be encouraged due to large variability in the amount and distribution of rainfall.

AB Lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from legume-based cropping systems have encouraged their use to deliver mitigation in agricultural systems. Considerable uncertainties remain about the interaction of legumes with long-term tillage systems on GHG emissions under rainfed agroecosystems. In this context, a field experiment was undertaken under a rainfed vetch crop to evaluate the effect of three long-term tillage systems (i.e. no tillage (NT), minimum tillage (MT) and conventional tillage (CT)) on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions for 1 year. Different N2O flux patterns were observed among tillage systems during the growth period of vetch, which depended on the soil conditions favouring nitrification and denitrification. The NT system maintained a higher sink for N2O than MT and CT from January to mid-April, which significantly reduced N2O emissions at this stage. In this period, denitrification capacity and nirK gene numbers were higher for MT than NT and CT. Additionally, an increase in soil NO (3) (-) content and more favourable denitrification conditions in MT and NT than in CT for the last crop period increased N2O emissions in conservation tillage systems. Total annual N2O losses were significantly higher in MT (124.2 g N2O-N ha(-1)) than NT (51.1 g N2O-N ha(-1)) and CT (54 g N2O-N ha(-1)) in a vetch crop. Low net uptake of CH4 was observed for all tillage systems. These results suggested that long-term NT may be a better option than MT to mitigate GHG emissions in rainfed legume-cereal rotation.

AB Nitrous oxide emissions from soil amended with untreated liquid manure (slurry), anaerobically digested slurry, or inorganic fertilizers (calcium ammonium nitrate or urea) were quantified in a field study revering two growth seasons of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), In the first year incorporation before seeding was compared with trail hose application 5 wk after seeding, In the second year all fertilizers were applied before seeding, while soil moisture and initial NO(3)(-) availability was varied. Accumulated N(2)O losses between the time of fertilization and ca. 1 July represented 0.14 to 0.35%: of total N in 1996 and 0.34 to 0.64% in 1997, In both years the highest N(2)O emissions were observed with untreated slurry, whereas digested slurry and inorganic fertilizers Here at a similar level,Increasing the soil moisture content or NO(3)(-); availabiliiy had no significant effect on accumulated N(2)O losses. Although metabolizable C may thus have stimulated N, emissions via denitrification from untreated slurry, the largest contribution to N(2)O fluxes probably came from nitrification with all fertilizer types, Using the IPCC guidelines it was estimated that anaerobic digestion of slurry per se could potentially reduce N,O emissions from Danish agriculture hy 1.2 to 2.5%.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are generally interrelated in soil nitrogen biogeochemical cycles. However, the effects of land-use change and fertilization on N2O and NO fluxes and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood, especially in fields converted from rice paddies (RPs) to upland cultivation. This study investigated the effects of land-use change from RPs to a citrus orchard (OR) as well as fertilization on N2O and NO fluxes, and the gene abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying microbial communities by using static chamber-gas chromatography and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Structural equation modeling was performed to determine whether soil properties and the abundances of nitrifiers and denitrifiers influenced in situ N2O and NO fluxes. Land-use change from RPs to an OR and fertilization significantly increased N2O and NO fluxes. Land-use change increased AOA abundance, did not affect AOB abundance, and decreased nirK, nirS, and nosZ abundances. The growth of AOA and AOB abundance in response to fertilization was generally stimulated by providing more NH4+, but sometimes was inhibited by lower pH. Fertilization did not significantly affect the abundance of denitrifiers. Soil properties and functional microbial groups were explanatory variables, while land-use change altered their role in predicting in situ N2O and NO fluxes. For N2O fluxes, dissolved organic carbon was the strongest predictor in the RPs, whereas the primary explanatory factor was nirK abundance in the OR. For NO fluxes, soil temperature was the most important explanatory variable. Our results demonstrate the need for comprehensive approaches incorporating nitrifying and denitrifying processes to improve our understanding of biogeochemical cycles.

AB Gaseous NO and NO2 (collectively termed NOx) are trace atmospheric constituents with important functions in various atmospheric and ecosystem processes. Because nitrification and denitrification in soil are included among major sources of the gases, simulation models for predicting soil-atmosphere NOx exchange should incorporate the strong dependence of these two microbial processes on soil temperature, soil water content, and substrate N availability. We briefly review current understanding of these controls, then describe how various authors have incorporated that knowledge into model parameterization schemes, and finally present some general thoughts regarding how well those schemes work and what might be missing. Existing coarse-scale models have evolved to the point that they are beginning to explicitly address the influences, interactions, and dynamics of all three microscale controllers in formulations suitable for studies at regional to global and seasonal to interannual scales. Perhaps the greatest limitation of the models, as well as their predictor variables, is that they often fail to account for the large pulse of gaseous N oxide emissions commonly observed following wetting of very dry soil. This failure is exacerbated by mounting evidence that similar pulses may occur following sudden removal of other environmental limitations on microbial growth and metabolism. Such pulses ostensibly make a large contribution to soil-atmosphere NOx exchange, especially in semi-arid, subhumid, and seasonally dry tropical regions of the globe where the exchange has been poorly characterized despite being subject to intense anthropogenic disturbance.

AB Ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx: nitrogen dioxide [NO2] + nitric oxide [NO]) play important roles in atmospheric chemistry. Throughout most of Africa, emissions of these gases are predominantly from soils and biomass burning. Here we use observations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument from 2005 through 2017 and atmospheric NH3 VCDs from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer from 2008 through 2017 to evaluate seasonal variation of NO2 and NH3 VCDs across Africa and in seven African ecoregions. In regions where mean annual precipitation (MAP) is under 500 mm yr(-1), we find that NO2 and NH3 VCDs are positively related to monthly precipitation, and where MAP is between 500 and 1,750 mm yr(-1) or higher, NO2 VCDs are negatively related to monthly precipitation. In dry ecoregions, temperature and precipitation were important predictors of NH3 and NO2 VCDs, likely related to variation in soil emissions. In mesic ecoregions, monthly NO2 VCDs were strongly related to burned area, suggesting that biomass burning drives seasonality. NH3 VCDs in mesic ecoregions were positively related to both monthly temperature and monthly carbon monoxide (CO) VCDs, suggesting that a mixture of soil and biomass burning emissions influenced NH3 seasonality. In northern mesic ecoregions, monthly temperature explained most of the variance in monthly NH3 VCDs, suggesting that soil sources, including animal excreta, determined NH3 seasonality. In southern mesic ecoregions, monthly CO VCDs explained more variation in NH3 VCDs than temperature, suggesting that biomass burning may have greater influence over NH3 seasonality.

AB Grazing-managed pasture is a major system of livestock production in many countries. Grazed pastures receive large inputs of nitrogen (N), derived from biological fixation of atmospheric N, through the addition of manures and fertilizers, and the deposition of animal excreta. However, only a small proportion of the N ( < 15%) consumed by grazing animals is converted to milk or live weight gain, the reminder is excreted. Loss of N occurs mainly through ammonia (NH3) volatilization, release of gaseous N such as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) through biological denitrification, and nitrate (NOD leaching, which has both economical and environmental implications. Nitrogen is an important plant nutrient and its loss affects both the quality and quantity of feed, thereby leading to poor animal production. Recently there have been increasing concerns about the environmental impacts of N loss through leaching (i.e., methaemoglobinaemia) and gaseous emission (i.e., greenhouse gas).
   In this chapter, the various sources of N input to grazed pasture are discussed in relation to the dynamics of N, the measurement and modelling gaseous emissions of N, and the implications of gaseous emission in relation to economic loss and environmental degradation. The dynamics of N transformations in soil-plant system with particular emphasis on the biochemistry of gaseous emission, and the measurement techniques and the use of process-based models to predict gaseous emissions are discussed. The practical implications of gaseous emission are discussed in relation to acid rain and climate change (i.e., the Kyoto Protocol). Grazing and farm management practices to mitigate gaseous emissions are highlighted. (C) 2004 by Elsevier Inc.

AB Fertilized agricultural soils can be a significant source of emissions of NO and N2O into the atmosphere. This study was conducted to determine the influence of N rate on the emissions of these gases in a no-till corn (Zea mays L.) crop grown in western Tennessee. The influence of N rate was assessed for a 210-d period on replicated plots receiving 0, 140, and 252 kg N ha(-1) (0N, 140N, and 252N) as ammonium nitrate (AN). Plots were located on a Routon silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, thermic Typic Ochraqualf) at the West Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station in Jackson, TN. Gas fluxes were measured by static chamber boxes located on plots. The measurement technique was automated and replicate chamber estimates were made eight times daily for the entire study period. Fertilizer application significantly affected both NO and N2O emission rates. The cumulative N2O-N lost from the fertilizer treatments was from 10 to 20-fold that of NO. On an areal basis, the 140N treatment emitted 4.23 kg N2O-N and 0.19 kg ha(-1) of NO-N whereas the 252N treatment emitted 6.56 kg N2O-N and 0.50 kg ha(-1) NO-N. Soil parameters of water-filled pore space (WFPS), NO3- and NH4+, were correlated with N2O emissions but only soil NO3- was correlated with NO flux. Our data, and more recent data in the literature, suggest that N2O emissions from fertilized soil may be considerably higher than previously thought. Emissions of N2O were 2.6 to 3.0% of the fertilizer amounts applied. These higher emissions may, in part, explain some of the reason for the shortfall in the global N2O budget.

AB Great attention has been paid to N2O emissions from paddy soils under summer rice-winter wheat double-crop rotation, while less focus was given to the NO emissions. Besides, neither mechanism is completely understood. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the relative importance of nitrification and denitrification to N2O and NO emissions from the two soils at different soil moisture contents
   N2O and NO emissions during one winter wheat season were simultaneously measured in situ in two rice-wheat based field plots at two different locations in Jiangsu Province, China. One soil was neutral in pH with silt loam texture (NSL), the other soil alkaline in pH with a clay texture (AC). A (15) N tracer incubation experiment was conducted in the laboratory to evaluate the relative importance of nitrification and denitrification for N2O and NO emissions at soil moisture contents of 40 % water holding capacity (WHC), 65 % WHC and 90 % WHC.
   Higher N2O emission rates in the AC soil than in the NSL soil were found both in the field and in the laboratory experiments; however, the differences in N2O emissions between AC soil and NSL soil were smaller in the field than in the laboratory. In the latter experiment, nitrification was observed to be the more important source of N2O emissions (> 70 %) than denitrification, regardless of the soils and moisture treatments, with the only exception of the AC soil at 90 % WHC, at which the contributions of nitrification and denitrification to N2O emissions were comparable. The ratios of NO/N2O also supported the evidence that the nitrification process was the dominant source of N2O and NO both in situ and in the laboratory. The proportion of nitrified N emitted as N2O (P (N2O) ) in NSL soil were around 0.02 % in all three moisture treatments, however, P (N2O) in the AC soil (0.04 % to 0.10 %) tended to decrease with increasing soil moisture content.
   Our results suggest that N2O emission rates obtained from laboratory incubation experiments are not suitable for the estimation of the true amount of N2O fluxes on a field scale. Besides, the variations of P (N2O) with soil property and soil moisture content should be taken into account in model simulations of N2O emission from soils.

AB A field experiment was carried out at a pilot plot that was cropped with oilseed rape, and then left partly fallow and partly cropped with a green manure (mustard) during the autumn after harvest of the oilseed rape. The rape residues were incorporated in the soil. Methods used to quantify the N fluxes from harvest until sowing of the next crop were (1) N-15 balance method, (2) total mineral N analysis and (3) NO emission measurements. Losses of spring applied fertilizer N were negligible in cropped plots and minimal in fallow plots during the following autumn-winter period. Most of the plant-N residues was retained by the organic N pool of the upper 30-cm soil layer. The green manure contributed slightly to soil available N at sowing of the next crop. However, the incorporation of plant material resulted in a nitrate flux that was at risk of leaching on the fallow plots, and on the green manure plots after incorporation of the green manure. This nitrate was largely derived from soil organic N, not from unused fertilizer applied in spring or from immobilized fertilizer.
   The NO emissions from the green manure plots were significantly higher than emissions from the fallow plots. The plants had a stimulating effect on the NO emission. A relationship between the NO emission and the soil nitrate concentration could not be established. No emissions were measured after green manure incorporation due to the low temperatures at the pilot plot. However, a greenhouse experiment showed an increased emission after incorporation. The NO emissions seemed to be related with the soil ammonium concentration.

AB Although the available data on soil NO emission are increasing, only few measurements have been made in temperate forests. Emissions from these forests are generally low, but recent studies have shown that NO emission from N-affected forests can be much higher. In this study the emission of NO from the door of a moderately N-affected. Norway spruce forest in Denmark was measured using dynamic chambers during two seasons (April 1995 and September 1995). At the same time, fluxes of CO2 and NO2, soil water content inside and outside the chambers, soil temperature at 10 cm depth, soil surface temperature and air temperature were, recorded. The emission of NO in April was low (< 0.3 ng N m(-2) s(-1)), whereas it was significantly higher in September (21 ng N (-2) s(-1) with a range 0-82 ng N m(-2) s(-1)). In April the soil surface temperature was low (< 6"C) and the soil moisture was high (26% vol/vol). In September the soil surface temperature was high (16 degrees C) and soil moisture was significantly lower (14% vol/vol) than in April. There was a high correlation between CO2 emission and NO emission. The fluxes of NO2 were very small and not related to NO emission. Generally, the variation within a single plot was small, whereas the variation between plots was large. About half of the total variation of NO emission in September could be explained by a combination of soil moisture, distance to tree trunks, and moss cover. No significant relationship could be found between NO emission and soil surface temperature or soil temperature. Other parameters such as the C/N dynamics in the soil must be taken into account to provide a better mechanistic understanding of the NO emission. An annual emission of 3.15 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1) was estimated by the amount of NH4+ in throughfall. Compared to most of the previous published measurements of NO emission from temperate forest soils, the values presented here are high and of the same magnitude as found in N-affected forests in Central Europe.

AB Biocrusts covering drylands account for major fractions of terrestrial biological nitrogen fixation and release large amounts of gaseous reactive nitrogen (Nr) as nitrous acid (HONO) and nitric oxide (NO). Recent investigations suggested that aerobic and anaerobic microbial nitrogen transformations occur simultaneously upon desiccation of biocrusts, but the spatio-temporal distribution of seemingly contradictory processes remained unclear. Here, we explore small-scale gradients in chemical concentrations related to structural characteristics and organism distribution. X-ray microtomography and fluorescence microscopy revealed mixed pore size structures, where photo-autotrophs and cyanobacterial polysaccharides clustered irregularly in the uppermost millimeter. Microsensor measurements showed strong gradients of pH, oxygen, and nitrite, nitrate, and ammonium ion concentrations at micrometer scales in both vertical and lateral directions. Initial oxygen saturation was mostly low (& SIM;30%) at full water holding capacity, suggesting widely anoxic conditions, and increased rapidly upon desiccation. Nitrite concentrations (& SIM;6 to 800 mu M) and pH values (similar to 6.5 to 9.5) were highest around 70% WHC. During further desiccation they decreased, while emissions of HONO and NO increased, reaching maximum values around 20% WHC. Our results illustrate simultaneous, spatially separated aerobic and anaerobic nitrogen transformations, which are critical for Nr emissions, but might be impacted by future global change and land management.

AB In this paper, we present two years of seasonal nitric oxide (NO), ammonia (NH3), and nitrous oxide (N2O) trace gas fluxes measured in a recovering riparian zone with cattle excluded and adjacent riparian zone grazed by cattle. In the recovering riparian zone, average NO, NH3, and N2O fluxes were 5.8, 2.0, and 76.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) (1.83, 0.63, and 24.19 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), respectively. Fluxes in the grazed riparian zone were larger, especially for NO and NH3, measuring 9.1, 4.3, and 77.6 ngN m(-2) s(-1) (2.87, 1.35, and 24.50 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) for NO, NH3, and N2O, respectively. On average, N2O accounted for greater than 85% of total trace gas flux in both the recovering and grazed riparian zones, though N2O fluxes were highly variable temporally. In the recovering riparian zone, variability in seasonal average fluxes was explained by variability in soil nitrogen (N) concentrations. Nitric oxide flux was positively correlated with soil ammonium (NH4+) concentration, while N2O flux was positively correlated with soil nitrate (NO3-) concentration. Ammonia flux was positively correlated with the ratio of NH4+ to NO3-. In the grazed riparian zone, average NH3 and N2O fluxes were not correlated with soil temperature, N concentrations, or moisture. This was likely due to high variability in soil microsite conditions related to cattle effects such as compaction and N input. Nitric oxide flux in the grazed riparian zone was positively correlated with soil temperature and NO3- concentration. Restoration appeared to significantly affect NO flux, which increased approximate to600% during the first year following restoration and decreased during the second year to levels encountered at the onset of restoration. By comparing the ratio of total trace gas flux to soil N concentration, we show that the restored riparian zone is likely more efficient than the grazed riparian zone at diverting upper-soil N from the receiving stream to the atmosphere. This is likely due to the recovery of microbiological communities following changes in soil physical characteristics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Data for trace gas fluxes (NOx, N2O, and CH4) from the Amazon and cerrado region are presented with focus on the processes of production and consumption of these trace gases in soils and how they may be changed because of land use changes in both regions. Fluxes are controlled by seasonality, soil moisture, soil texture, topography, and fine-root dynamics. Compared to Amazonian forests where the rapid cycling of nitrogen supports large emissions of N2O, nitrification rates and soil emissions of N oxide gases in the cerrado region are very low. Several studies report CH4 consumption during both wet and dry seasons in forest soils, but there is occasionally net production of CH4 during the wet season. A few studies suggest an unknown source of CH4 from upland forests. As with N oxide emissions, there are few data on CH4 emissions from cerrado soils, but CH4 consumption occurs during both wet and dry seasons. Clearing natural vegetation, burning, fertilization of agricultural lands, intensive cattle ranching, and increasing dominance by legume species in areas under secondary succession after land conversion have all been identified as causes of increasing N2O and NO emissions from tropical regions. Large uncertainties remain for regional estimates of trace gas fluxes. Improvement of models for the N oxides and CH4 fluxes for Amazonia and the cerrado still depends upon gathering more data from sites more widely distributed across two vast biomes and more importantly on basic theory about the controls of emissions from the ecosystem to the atmosphere.

AB Enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) have the potential to reduce N2O emissions and improve crop productivity, but the impact of soil and management conditions on their effectiveness is not clear. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of different EEF types in reducing N2O emissions in three cereal production systems: rice (Oryza sativa L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We also compared EEF efficacy across soil and management conditions for corn and wheat systems. Results showed that the effect of EEFs on N2O emissions and crop yields varied greatly with their modes of action, soil types, and management conditions. Nitrification inhibitors (NIs), double inhibitors (DIs: urease plus nitrification inhibitors), and controlled-release N fertilizers (CRFs) consistently reduced N2O emissions compared with conventional N fertilizers across soil and management conditions (grand mean decreases of 38, 30, and 19%, respectively). The Dls more effectively reduced N2O emissions in alkaline soils than did Nls, but the trend was reversed in acidic soils. Urease inhibitors also reduced N2O emissions compared with conventional N fertilizers in coarse-textured soils and irrigated systems. Overall crop yields increased by 7% with the addition of Nls alone. Compared with conventional N fertilizers, Dls also increased crop yields in alkaline soils, coarse-textured soils, and irrigated systems. However, CRFs had no effect on crop yields. Overall, this study suggests that Nls or Dls can reduce N2O emissions while improving crop yields. Growers should select EEFs based on their soil and management conditions to maximize their effectiveness.

AB In many countries, high nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions have been observed during soil freezing and thawing periods. Quantification of those emissions is crucial to evaluate annual N2O emissions. For this study, we measured N2O and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes along with soil N2O concentrations at a corn (Zea mays L.) field and five grasslands (Phalaris arundinacea L. and Phleum pratense L.) during a winter-spring period in southern Hokkaido, Japan. We also measured denitrification activities of the soils from those sites. During the observation period, the soils froze to a maximum depth of 370 mm under saturated conditions and the lowest soil temperature at a 50 mm depth was -4.5 degrees C. After 6 March 2005, daily air temperature rose above 0 degrees C, but the soil temperature remained approximately 0 degrees C for about two weeks. These two weeks were defined as the "transition period,'' while the periods before and after the transition period were defined as the "freezing'' and the "thawing'' periods, respectively. During the freezing and transition periods, N2O concentration increased in the frozen soils relative to the unfrozen soils, and the highest values were observed in the frozen soils during the transition period. During the thawing period, the N2O concentration in the soils decreased. N2O emissions were much higher during the thawing period than during the freezing and transition periods, and remarkably higher N2O emissions were observed at the corn site compared to those at the grassland sites. NO emissions were also observed during the thawing period but at much lower levels than N2O emissions at all the sites. N2O-N/NO-N ratio exceeded one at all the sites during the entire period, indicating N2O production through denitrification. At the corn site, denitrification activity was much lower and N2O/(N2O+N-2) was much higher than at the grasslands. The result indicated that high N2O emissions at the corn site were caused by complementary processes: (1) high accumulated N2O through denitrification in the frozen soil during the freezing and transition periods, and (2) low N2O reduction rate during the thawing period.

AB The eastern Amazon Basin may become drier as a result of less regional recirculation of water in a largely deforested landscape and because of increased frequency and intensity of El Nino events induced by global warming. Drier conditions may affect several plant and soil microbial processes, including soil emissions of CO2, CH4, NO, and N2O. We report here unanticipated results of a pilot study that was initiated to test the feasibility of a larger-scale throughfall exclusion experiment. In particular, soil drying caused a switch from net consumption of atmospheric CH4 by soils in the control plot to net CH4 emission from soils in the experimentally dried plot. This result is surprising because production of CH4 requires anaerobic microsites, which are uncommon in dry soil. A plausible explanation for increased CH4 emissions in the dried plot is that dry soil conditions favor termite activity and increased coarse root mortality provides them with a substrate. Another surprise was,that both NO and N2O fluxes were elevated several years after initiation of the drying experiment. Apparently, a pulse of N availability caused by experimental drying persisted for at least 3 years. As expected, CO2 emissions were lower in the dried plots, which is consistent with lower rates of root growth observed in root in-growth cores placed in the dried plots. More work is needed to test these explanations and to confirm these phenomena, but these results demonstrate that changes in climate could have unanticipated effects on biogeochemical processes in soils that we do not adequately understand.

AB NO production rates, NO uptake rate constants, NO compensation points, and different soil variables were determined for various soil types and different soil horizons, and checked for mutual correlations. NO production was detected in all, and NO comsuption in most soils tested. Only soils in a very early state of soil genesis showed no NO consumption activity. NO consumption was positively correlated with soil water and NH4+ contents. NO production rates were not correlated with any soil variable. Both NO production and NO consumption tended to decrease from the upper organic to the deeper mineral horizons in different climax soils. The seasonal variation of NO production and NO consumption in a calcic cambisol and a luvisol showed highest rates in summer. The rates of NO production and NO consumption were correlated with a few of the soil variables, but showed no uniform, theoretically comprehensible pattern. However, NO production in samples of the calcic cambisol was stimulated by fertilization with NH4+, but not with NO3- and was inhibited by nitrapyrin, indicating that NO was produced by nitrification. NO production made up about 3% of the nitrification rates. In the luvisol, in contrast, NO production was not affected by the addition of NH4+ or NO3-. Nitrification was also undetectable in this acidic soil, except for a few patches where NO production was also detected.

AB Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are a primary component of air pollution-a leading cause of premature death in humans and biodiversity declines worldwide. Although regulatory policies in California have successfully limited transportation sources of NOx pollution, several of the United States' worst-air quality districts remain in rural regions of the state. Site-based findings suggest that NOx emissions from California's agricultural soils could contribute to air quality issues; however, a statewide estimate is hitherto lacking. We show that agricultural soils are a dominant source of NOx pollution in California, with especially high soil NOx emissions from the state's Central Valley region. We base our conclusion on two independent approaches: (i) a bottom-up spatial model of soil NOx emissions and (ii) top-down airborne observations of atmospheric NOx concentrations over the San Joaquin Valley. These approaches point to a large, overlooked NOx source from cropland soil, which is estimated to increase the NOx budget by 20 to 51%. These estimates are consistent with previous studies of point-scale measurements of NOx emissions from the soil. Our results highlight opportunities to limit NOx emissions from agriculture by investing in management practices that will bring co-benefits to the economy, ecosystems, and human health in rural areas of California.

AB Soil is a major source of nitrogen trace gases (NTGs). Microbial denitrification has long been identified as a source of NTGs under reducing conditions, whereas the production of NTGs during nitrification is far from being completely understood. This review updates information about the role of abiotic processes in the formation of gaseous N products in soil and brings attention to the potential interplay of microbial and chemical soil processes that tend to be neglected in research on NTG emissions. Several reactions that involve the nitrification intermediates, nitrite (NO2-) and hydroxylamine (NH2OH), are known to produce the NTGs nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). These abiotic reactions are: the self-decomposition of NO2-, reactions of NO2- with reduced metal cations, nitrosation of soil organic matter (SOM) by NO2-, the reaction between NO2- and NH2OH, and the oxidation of NH2OH by Fe3+ or MnO2. These reactions can occur over a broad range of soil characteristics, but they are disregarded in most current research on NTG studies in favour of biological processes only. Relatively few studies have tried to quantify the contribution of abiotic processes to total NTG emissions, which results in uncertainty in emission models and mitigation strategies. It is difficult to discriminate between biological and abiotic sources because both processes can proceed at the same time in the same soil layer. The potential of stable isotope techniques to disentangle the different processes in soil and to constrain budgets of atmospheric NTGs better are highlighted. Recent advances in stable isotope technologies, such as infrared real-time laser spectroscopy, provide considerable potential for both natural abundance and tracer studies in this field.

AB Measuring the nitrogen isotope compositions (delta N-15) of nitric oxide (NO) from different sources helps to quantify the relative contributions of atmospheric NOx. Soil is one of the most important sources of atmospheric NOx, but only limited measurements on the delta N-15 of soil-emitted NO exist, hampering our ability to partition sources to air pollution. Here we conducted soil incubations to measure the delta N-15-NO under defined aerobic or anaerobic conditions, favoring either nitrification or denitrification. Soils were collected from seven sites spanning three ecosystems in northern China (two agricultural, two forest, and three grassland sites). We found that the delta N-15-NO and their associated N isotope fractionations were significantly different between anaerobic and aerobic conditions in seven soils. Under aerobic condition, the delta N-15-NO ranged from -62 parts per thousand to -50 parts per thousand (averaged -56 +/- 4 parts per thousand), being significantly more negative (by 23 parts per thousand) than those under anaerobic condition (-45 parts per thousand to -23 parts per thousand, averaged -33 +/- 7 parts per thousand). The apparent N isotope fractionation for NO production under aerobic condition ((15)epsilon(aerobic) = 61 +/- 3 parts per thousand) was significantly higher (by 26 parts per thousand) than under anaerobic condition ((15)epsilon(anaerobic) = 35 +/- 6 parts per thousand), with a small variability among ecosystem types. Our study demonstrates that the delta N-15-NO from different soils are very different from fuel combustions (mainly from 0 parts per thousand to +20 parts per thousand), supporting that measuring(15)N is a useful tool to partition the contributions of soil NO to atmospheric NOx. Our results also imply delta N-15-NO produced by nitrification and denitrification distinctly different, as these two processes are dominant processes producing NO under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively.

AB Rainfed agriculture is one of the most common farming practices in the world and is vulnerable to global climate change. However, only limited studies have been conducted on rainfed agriculture, mainly using low-frequency manual techniques, which caused large uncertainties in estimating annual N2O emissions. In this study, we used a fully automated system to continuously measure soil N2O emissions for two years (April 2017 to March 2019) in a typical rainfed maize field in Northeast China. The annual N2O emissions were 2.8 kg N ha(-1) in year 1 (April 2017 to March 2018) and 1.8 kg N ha(-1) in year 2 (April 2018 to March 2019), accounting for 1.9 and 1.2% of the nitrogen fertilizer applied, respectively. The inter-annual variability was mainly due to different weather conditions encountered in years 1 and 2. A severe drought in year 1 reduced plant N uptake, leaving high mineral N in the soil, and the following moderate rainfalls promoted a large amount of N2O emissions. The seasonal pattern of N2O fluxes was mainly controlled by soil temperature and soil nitrate concentration. Both soil moisture and the molar ratio of NO/N2O indicate that N2O and NO were mainly derived from nitrification, resulting in a significant positive correlation between N2O and NO flux in the intra-rows (where nitrogen fertilizer was applied). Moreover, we observed that the N2O emissions during the freeze-thaw periods were negligible in this region for rainfed agriculture. Our long-term and high-resolution measurements of soil N2O emissions suggest that sampling between LST 9:00 and 10:00 is the best empirical sampling time for the intermittent manual measurements.
