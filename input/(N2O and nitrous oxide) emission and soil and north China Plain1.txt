AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) emissions from an agricultural field in the North China Plain were compared for three treatments during a whole maize growing period from 26 June to 11 October, 2012. Compared with the control treatment (without fertilization, designated as CK), remarkable pulse emissions of N2O, NO and NH3 were observed from the normal fertilization treatment (designated as NP) just after fertilization, whereas only N2O and NH3 pulse emissions were evident from the nitrification inhibitor treatment (designated as ND). The reduction proportions of N2O and NO emissions from the ND treatment compared to those from the NP treatment during the whole maize growing period were 31% and 100%, respectively. A measurable increase of NH3 emission from the ND treatment was found with a cumulative NH3 emission of 3.8 +/- 1.2 kg N/ha, which was 1.4 times greater than that from the NP treatment (2.7 +/- 0.7 kg N/ha).

AB Crop straw returning has become a prevailing cultivation practice in the vast area of the North China Plain (NCP), while few investigations about its influence on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission have been conducted, In this study, N2O emissions from an agricultural field in the NCP with and without straw returning were comparably investigated by using static chambers in two consecutive maize-wheat growing seasons from June 2010 to June 2012. Compared with the NP treatment (compound nitrogen fertilizer only), the cumulative N2O emission from the SP treatment (compound nitrogen fertilizer plus straw) increased about 150% during the maize season in 2010, but decreased by about 35% during the maize season in 2011. The inconsistent influence of straw returning on N2O emission from the maize field was ascribed to the evidently different soil moisture between the two years, which was further confirmed by laboratory simulation experiments. About 40% reduction of N2O emission from the SP treatment during the two winter wheat seasons, which was mainly attributed to anoxic condition induced by rotting the maize straw.

AB Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from agricultural soils contribute to global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. Applications of fertilizer nitrogen (N) increase N2O emission, but also increase agricultural production. Here, we report on the responses of crop yield. N2O emission and yield-scaled N2O emission (N2O emission per unit N uptake by grain and aboveground biomass) to different N fertilizer rates in a winter wheat-summer corn double-cropping system in the North China Plain. Soil N2O emission measurements were carried out for two years in a long-term field experiment, under semi-arid conditions with four flood irrigations events per year. Our results indicated that N2O emissions were linear functions and yield-scaled N2O emissions were cubic functions of N fertilizer application rate. Yield-scaled N2O emissions were lowest at application rates of 136 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Using a quadratic-plateau model, it was found that maximal crop yields were achieved at an application rate of 317 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), which is 20% less than current practice. This level is suggested to be a compromise between achieving food security and mitigation N2O emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Little information is available on the effects of urease inhibitor, N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), and nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from fluvo-aquic soil in the North China Plain. A field experiment was conducted at the Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station, Henan Province, China, to study the influence of urea added with NBPT, DCD, and combination of both NBPT and DCD on N2O emissions during the maize growing season in 2009. Two peaks of N2O fluxes occurred during the maize growing season: the small one following irrigation and the big one after nitrogen (N) fertilizer application. There was a significant positive relationship between In [N2O flux] and soil moisture during the maize growing season excluding the 11-day datasets after N fertilizer application, indicating that N2O flux was affected by soil moisture. Mean N2O flux was the highest in the control with urea alone, while the application of urea together with NBPT, DCD, and NBPT + DCD significantly lowered the mean N2O flux. Total N2O emission in the NBPT + DCD, DCD, NBPT, and urea alone treatments during the experimental period was 0.41, 0.47, 0.48, and 0.77 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively. Application of urea with NBPT, DCD, and NBPT + DCD reduced N2O emission by 37.7%, 39.0%, and 46.8%, respectively, over urea alone. Based on our findings, the combination of DCD and NBPT together with urea may reduce N2O emission and improve the maize yield from fluvo-aquic soil in the North China Plain.

AB Agricultural soil has been recognized as a major source of atmospheric NO and N2O emissions which have important impacts on regional and global environments. Here we comparably investigated the effects of ammonium, nitrate fertilizers and nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) addition on NO and N2O emissions from the agricultural soil in the North China Plain (NCP). Compared with the ammonium fertilizer application, the reductions of NO emissions caused by nitrate fertilizer and DCD addition were 100% and 93%, and of N2O emissions were 54% and 74%, respectively. Remarkable reductions of NO and N2O emissions were also observed from five different agricultural soils in the NCP by replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer, indicating that nitrification is the predominant process for the emissions of NO and N2O from the soils in the vast area of NCP. NO emission peaks were found to be several days later than N2O peaks after the application of ammonium fertilizer and flooding irrigation, implying that most of NO initially produced via nitrification process might be fast reduced to N2O under the high soil moisture condition. Interestingly, the relative contribution of denitrification to N2O emission showed obviously time-dependent, e.g., evident N2O emission caused by the application of nitrate was only observed after the basal fertilization for the maize and the top dressing for the wheat. Replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer and mixing with the nitrification inhibitor are verified to be effective measures for mitigating NO and N2O emissions from arable soils in the NCP.

AB NO2- plays a crucial role in regulating N2O formation from the soil, while how it affects the production of soil N2O is still not well understood. In this study, N2O and NO emissions from an agricultural field of the North China Plain (NCP) were comparatively investigated under live different fertilizer treatments (NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+ + NO2- and NO3- + NO2-). Additionally, soil NH4+, NO2- and NO3- concentrations and the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen cycling were also analyzed in the incubation experiment. The results showed that the N2O average fluxes from the complex treatments of NO2- + NO3- were 1.4-2.4 times the sum of those from the separate treatments of NO2- and NO3- whereas from the complex treatments of NO2- + NH4+ were a factor of 1 - 1.4 larger than those from the separate treatments of NO(2)( )(-)and NH4+, indicating the coupling interaction of NO2- with NH4+ or NO3- makes a remarkable contribution to N2O emission from the soil. Significant reduction of the activity of N2O reductase was found in the soil with the addition of NO2-, which favored the accumulation of N2O formed through nitrification of NH4+ and denitrification of NO2-, resulting in relatively high N2O emissions from the complex treatments. As the intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification, NO2- produced is also expected to interact with NH(4)( )(+)or NO3- to promote N2O emission from the soil, especially during fertilization events when NO2- is easily accumulated due to the acceleration of the nitrification and denitrification processes.

AB The IPCC assume a linear relationship between nitrogen (N) application rate and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in inventory reporting, however, a growing number of studies show a nonlinear relationship under specific soil-climatic conditions. In the North China plain, a global hotspot of N2O emissions, covering a land as large as Germany, the correlation between N rate and N2O emissions remains unclear. We have therefore specifically investigated the N2O response to N applications by conducting field experiments with five N rates, and high-frequency measurements of N2O emissions across contrasting climatic years. Our results showed that cumulative and yield-scaled N2O emissions both increased exponentially as N applications were raised above the optimum rate in maize (Zea mays L.). In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) there was a corresponding quadratic increase in N2O emissions with the magnitude of the response in 2012-2013 distinctly larger than that in 2013-2014 owing to the effects of extreme snowfall. Existing empirical models (including the IPCC approach) of the N2O response to N rate have overestimated N2O emissions in the North China plain, even at high N rates. Our study therefore provides a new and robust analysis of the effects of fertilizer rate and climatic conditions on N2O emissions.

AB Effects of different irrigation methods on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in winter wheat field are poorly understood. In this study, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were investigated in winter wheat field irrigated with surface drip irrigation (SDI), sprinkler irrigation (SI) and flood irrigation (CK) from 1 April to 31 May of 2014 in the North China Plain. The results showed that SDI increased CH4 uptake by 22.9%, reduced N2O emission by 14.6%, improved irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) by 44.2%, and could keep yield steady. IWUE and yield of winter wheat in SI was greater than that in CK by 28.2% and 8.5%, respectively. These combined results indicated that SDI may not only guarantee yield stability, but also mitigate GHG (CH4 and N2O) emissions and improve IWUE. Therefore, more attention should be paid to apply SDI in winter wheat field in the North China Plain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Agricultural ditches emit disproportionate amounts of nitrous oxide (N2O), but their contributions to regional or global N2O emissions remain unclear due to limited data. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends using emission factors (EFs) to estimate indirect N2O emission, but the EF for ditches (EF5g) is categorized as groundwater, which potentially introduces a significant bias. This study conducted a regional-scale campaign in the North China Plain, one of the world's most intensive agricultural regions, and calculated the EF5g values from agricultural ditches by the concentration method (N2O-N/NO3 --N). The results found that the regional-scale mean EF5g value (0.0028) was less than half of the IPCC default value (0.006), illustrating that the current IPCC methodology significantly overestimates N2O emissions from agricultural ditches. Despite the relatively small EF5g values, agricultural ditches exhibited a high mean N2O concentration (3.36 mu g L-1) and a large regional emission (1.14 +/- 0.86 Gg N2O-N yr-1), which is equal to 3.8 +/- 2.9% of direct N2O emission from the croplands in the North China Plain. Since ditches are ubiquitous in agricultural regions and are likely to expand under climate change, refining EF5g is crucial to accurately assess their contribution to global N2O budgets.

AB The objective of this study was to quantify soil methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions when converting from minimum and no-tillage systems to subsoiling (tilled soil to a depth of 40 cm to 45 cm) in the North China Plain. The relationships between CH4 and N2O flux and soil temperature, moisture, NH4+-N, organic carbon (SOC) and pH were investigated over 18 months using a split-plot design. The soil absorption of CH4 appeared to increase after conversion from no-tillage (NT) to subsoiling (NTS), from harrow tillage (HT) to subsoiling (HTS) and from rotary tillage (RT) to subsoiling (RTS). N2O emissions also increased after conversion. Furthermore, after conversion to subsoiling, the combined global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 and N2O increased by approximately 0.05 kg CO2 ha(-1) for HTS, 0.02 kg CO2 ha(-1) for RTS and 0.23 kg CO2 ha(-1) for NTS. Soil temperature, moisture, SOC, NH4+-N and pH also changed after conversion to subsoiling. These changes were correlated with CH4 uptake and N2O emissions. However, there was no significant correlation between N2O emissions and soil temperature in this study. The grain yields of wheat improved after conversion to subsoiling. Under HTS, RTS and NTS, the average grain yield was elevated by approximately 42.5%, 27.8% and 60.3% respectively. Our findings indicate that RTS and HTS would be ideal rotation tillage systems to balance GWP decreases and grain yield improvements in the North China Plain region.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a maize field in the North China Plain (Wangdu County, Hebei Province, China) were investigated using static chambers during two consecutive maize growing seasons in the 2008 and 2009. The N2O pulse emissions occurred with duration of about 10 days after basal and additional fertilizer applications in the both years. The average N2O fluxes from the CK (control plot, without crop, fertilization and irrigation), NP (chemical N fertilizer), SN (wheat straw returning plus chemical N fertilizer), OM-1/2N (chicken manure plus half chemical N fertilizer) and OMN (chicken manure plus chemical N fertilizer) plots in 2008 were 8.51, 72.1, 76.6, 101, 107 ng N/(m(2).sec), respectively, and in 2009 were 33.7, 30.0 and 35.0 ng N/(m(2).sec) from CK, NP and SN plots, respectively. The emission factors of the applied fertilizer as N2O-N (EFs) were 3.8% (2008) and 1.1% (2009) for the NP plot, 3.2% (2008) and 1.2% (2009) for the SN plot, and 2.8% and 2.2% in 2008 for the OM-1/2N and OMN plots, respectively. Hydromorphic properties of the investigated soil (with gley) are in favor of denitrification. The large differences of the soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) between the two maize seasons were suspected to be responsible for the significant yearly variations. Compared with the treatments of NP and SN, chicken manure coupled with compound fertilizer application significantly reduced fertilizer loss rate as N2O-N.

AB Many studies have focused on various agricultural management measures to reduce agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. However, few studies have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems in the North China Plain. Thus, we conducted a field experiment to compare N2O emissions under monoculture and maize-legume intercropping systems. In 2010, five treatments, including monocultured maize (M), maize-peanut (MP), maize-alfalfa (MA), maize-soybean (MS), and maize-sweet clover (MSC) intercropping were designed to investigate this issue using the static chamber technique. In 2011, M, MP, and MS remained, and monocultured peanuts (P) and soybean (S) were added to the trial. The results showed that total production of N2O from different treatments ranged from (0.87 +/- 0.12) to (1.17 +/- 0.11) kg ha(-1) in 2010, while those ranged from (3.35 +/- 0.30) to (9.10 +/- 2.09) kg ha(-1) in 2011. MA and MSC had no significant effect on soil N2O production compared to that of M (P<0.05). Cumulative N2O emissions from MP in 2010 were significantly lower than those from M, but the result was the opposite in 2011 (P<0.05). MS significantly reduced soil N2O emissions by 25.55 and 48.84% in 2010 and 2011, respectively (P<0.05). Soil N2O emissions were significantly correlated with soil water content, soil temperature, nitrification potential, soil NH4+, and soil NO3- content (R-2=0.160-0.764, P<0.01). A stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that soil N2O release was mainly controlled by the interaction between soil moisture and soil NO3- content (R-2=0.828, P<0.001). These results indicate that MS had a coincident effect on soil N2O flux and significantly reduced soil N2O production compared to that of M over two growing seasons.

AB The winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain is a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to high nitrogen (N) fertilizer and irrigation water inputs. However, a detailed understanding of the contribution of N2O production sources is still limited because of the complexity of N2O generation in soils and a lack of relevant field studies. Moreover, the efficiency and mechanisms of N2O mitigation approaches in this area, i.e. the use of nitrification inhibitors, remains poorly understood. To elucidate the N2O production pathways from this rotation system and to evaluate the effect of a widely used nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on mitigating N2O emissions, we monitored N2O fluxes and analyzed isotopomer ratios of soil-emitted N2O during one rotation year. Results indicate that the application of DMPP significantly reduced N2O emissions by 67% in the winter wheat season and 47% in the summer maize season. Isotopomer analysis revealed that in the N-fertilized treatment, nitrification and/or fungal denitrification accounted for up to 36% of the N2O emission peaks observed after fertilization and irrigation events, whereas the nitrifier denitrification pathway was likely to be the major source, accounting for the remaining N2O emissions. The high effectiveness of the nitrification inhibitor on mitigating N2O emissions at high soil moisture may be attributed to the dual inhibitory effect on nitrifier denitrification, i.e. reducing the supply of nitrite, which is the substrate of nitrifier denitrification and inhibiting ammonia-oxidizing bacteria activities, which carry nitrifier denitrification.

AB Intercrop systems can exhibit unique soil properties compared to monocultures, which influences the microbially-mediated processes leading to greenhouse gas emissions. Fertilized intercrops and monocultures produce different amounts of N2O, CO2 and CH4 depending on their nutrient and water use efficiencies. The objective of this study was to compare the fluxes and seasonal emissions of N2O, CO2, and CH4 from a maize-soybean intercrop compared to maize and soybean monocultures, in relation to crop effects on soil properties. The experiment was conducted during 2012, 2013 and 2014 at the WuQiao Experimental Station in the North China Plain. All cropping systems received urea-N fertilizer (240 kg N ha(-1) applied in two split applications). The cropping systems were a net source of CO2 and a net sink of CH4, with significantly (P < 0.05 in 2012) and numerically (2013 and 2014) lower N2O flux and smaller seasonal N2O emissions from the maize-soybean intercrop than the maize monoculture. The proportion of urea-N lost as N2O was lower in the maize-soybean intercrop (1.6% during the 3-year study) and soybean monoculture (1.7%), compared to maize monoculture (2.3%). Soybean reduced the soil NO3 (-)-N concentration and created a cooler, drier environment that was less favorable for denitrification, although we cannot rule out the possibility of N2O reduction to N-2 and other N compounds by soybean and its associated N-2-fixing prokaryotes. We conclude that maize-soybean intercrop has potential to reduce N2O emissions in fertilized agroecosystems and should be considered in developing climate-smart cropping systems in the North China Plain.

AB Substituting synthetic fertilizers with manures in agriculture enhances soil properties and crop yield. However, the impact on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, especially from the soil profile, remains poorly understood. This study examined emissions from 2017 to 2019 on a well-established (>10-year) maize field site in the North China Plain. Three treatments were compared: 100 % synthetic nitrogen (NPK), 50 % synthetic fertilizer N + 50 % manure N substitution (50%MNS), and 100 % manure N substitution (100%MNS). N2O emissions were monitored for three years, and in 2019, N2O concentrations at 20 cm and 40 cm soil depths were analyzed in relation to surface N2O fluxes and environmental factors. The results showed manure substitution resulted in about 13.8 %-25.2 % (50%MNS) and 40.3 %-72.2 % (100%MNS) reduction in N2O emissions over the 3-year period compared with the NPK treatment. Throughout the maize growing season, the top-dressing accompanied by rainfall was responsible for the N2O emissions. The difference in N2O concentrations between all the treatments at 20 cm depth was insignificant, but at 40 cm depth the N2O concentrations were significantly higher for the 50%MNS treatment than the other treatments. The N2O fluxes and N2O concentration were not synchronized especially in NPK. The decoupled relationship between the N2O fluxes and the N2O concentration in the soil profile depth suggested the contribution of N2O produced in the soil profile to the surface N2O fluxes is limited. This study highlights that manure substitution is an efficient measure to reduce N2O emissions.

AB Straw-return with fungal treatment is a potential method for reducing soil greenhouse gas emissions through carbon (C) sequestration and N2O mitigation. However, there is little information on the effects of different fungal treatments of crop straw return on soil CO2 and N2O emissions. To explore to what extent decomposed corn straw and its components controls soil CO2 and N2O emissions, we set up three sequential incubation experiments using soil collected from the North China Plain, an intensive agricultural area. Interactions between the different C contents of corn straw (CS), CS pretreated with Irpex lacteus (ICS), CS pretreated with Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PCS) and different NO3--N concentrations on the effect of soil CO2 and N2O emissions were conducted, and the kinetics of CO2 and N2O as influenced by changes in soil biochemical factors were analyzed. The effects of different lignocellulose components (lignin, cellulose, and xylan) on soil CO2 and N2O emissions were further studied.
   The results showed that straw pretreatment did not affect CO2 emissions. Both CO2 and N2O emissions increased when the C and N contents increased. However, applying PCS to 70% water -filled pore space soil effectively decreased the soil N2O emissions, by 41.8%-76.3% compared with adding the same level of CS. Moreover, extracellular enzyme activities related to C and N cycling were triggered, and the nosZI and nosZII abundances were significantly stimulated by the PCS application. These effects are closely related to the initial soluble C content of this treatment. Furthermore, adding xylan can significantly reduce N2O emissions.
   Overall, our data suggest that the environmentally beneficial effects of returning straw can be greatly enhanced by applying the straw-degrading white-rot fungi of P. chrysosporium in the North China Plain soil. Future studies are needed in the field to upscale this technology. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In agroecosystems, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are influenced by both microbiome composition and soil properties, yet the relative importance of these factors in determining differential N2O emissions remains unclear. This study investigates the impacts of these factors on N2O emissions using two primary agricultural soils from northern China: fluvo-aquic soil (FS) from the North China Plain and black soil (BS) from Northeast China, which exhibit significant differences in physicochemical properties. In non-sterilized controls (NSC), we observed distinct denitrifying bacterial phenotypes between FS and BS, with BS exhibiting significantly higher N2O emissions. Cross-inoculation experiments were conducted by introducing extracted microbiomes into sterile recipient soils of both types to disentangle the relative contributions of soil properties and microbiomes on N2O emission potential. The results showed recipient-soil-dependent gas kinetics, with significantly higher N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratios in BS compared to FS, regardless of the inoculum type. Metagenomic analysis further revealed significant shifts in denitrification genes and microbial diversity of the inoculated bacteriomes influenced by the recipient soil. The higher ratios of nirS/nosZ in FS and nirK/nosZ in BS indicated that the recipient soil dictates the formation of different denitrifying guilds. Specifically, the BS environment fosters nirK-based denitrifiers like Rhodanobacter, contributing to higher N2O accumulation, while FS supports a diverse array of denitrifiers, including Pseudomonas and Stutzerimonas, associated with complete denitrification and lower N2O emissions. This study underscores the critical role of soil properties in shaping microbial community dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions. These findings highlight the importance of considering soil physicochemical properties in managing agricultural practices to mitigate N2O emissions.

AB Agricultural soils are the largest anthropogenic emission source of nitrous oxide (N2O). National agricultural policies have been implemented to increase crop yield and reduce nitrogen (N) losses to the environment. However, it is difficult to effectively quantify crop-specific and regional N2O mitigation priorities driven by policies, due to lack of long-term, high-resolution crop-specific activity data, and oversimplified models. Here, we quantify the spatiotemporal changes and key drivers of crop-specific cropland-N2O emissions from China between 1980 and 2017, and future N2O mitigation potentials, using a linear mixed-effect model and survey-based data set of agricultural management measures. Cropland-N2O emissions from China tripled from 102.5 to 315.0 Gg N yr(-1) between 1980 and 2017, and decelerated since 1998 mainly driven by country-wide deceleration and decrease in N rate and the changes in sowing structure. About 63% of N2O emissions could be reduced in 2050, primarily in the North China Plain and Northeast China Plain; 83% of which is from the production of maize (33%), vegetables (27%), and fruits (23%). The deceleration of N2O emissions highlights that policy interventions and agronomy practices (i.e., optimizing N rate and sowing structure) are potential pathways for further ambitious N2O mitigation in China and other developing countries.

AB Using an enclosed chamber technique, N2O emissions from intensively cultivated soils in the North China Plain were measured during periods fi om October 1995 to September 1996 and June 1997 to June 1998, to reflect distinct contributions of the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons. The results show that the measured annual mean emission of N2O from soils treated with chemical N Fertilizer and from soils treated with chemical N fertilizer combined with organic manure were 52.8 and 61.4 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. These emissions from fertilized soils were significantly higher right after the chemical fertilizer was applied. A relatively low annual mean emission of 2.2 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1) was measured in soils that had not been Fertilized for 12 years. Maximal annual emissions of N2O from the studied agroecosystem were 3.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1). The results indicate that the application of organic manure also had a significant effect on N2O emissions, which combined with the use of chemical N fertilizer increased about 20% over the whole year. A weak correlation was found between N2O emissions and soil available NH4+ N content. Average annual N2O emission from fertilized soils was estimated to be 57.1 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1), which is in good agreement with the average emission of 52.7 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1) reported in other fertilized soil Bur studies at different locations in China.

AB In the North China Plain (NCP), urea is applied to predominantly high-pH soils and high gaseous losses of N are observed in the forms of ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The production of N2O and N-2 is further stimulated by the addition of fresh organic materials. The urease inhibitor (UI) N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) restricts the loss of N by reducing the rate of urea hydrolysis and limiting the substrates for NH3 and N2O emission. We investigated the turnover of N-as well as the emissions of NH3, N2O and CO2-as affected by the addition of wheat straw and urea +NBPT in an incubation experiment using soil from a farmer's field, typical for the NCP. Added wheat straw prolonged the persistence of NH4+ after the application of both urea and urea +NBPT, while reducing the formation of nitrate. Wheat straw may therefore either act as a stimulant of hydrolysis or as an inhibitor of nitrification. Urea increased soil respiration and the emission of N2O, possibly acting as a primer for microbial activity as described in earlier studies. In combination with the application of organic C sources, this effect of urea may be a main driver of gaseous N loss.

AB Optimizing crop rotations is one of the proposed sustainable management strategies for increasing carbon sequestration. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model for estimating soil parameters (temperature, moisture and exchangeable NO3- and NH4+), crop yield and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions for long-term multi-cropping systems in Hebei, China. The model was validated using five years of data of soil parameters, crop yields and N2O emissions. The DNDC model effectively simulated daily soil temperature, cumulative soil nitrogen and crop yields of all crops. It predicted the trends of observed daily N2O emissions and their cumulative values well but overestimated the magnitude of some peaks. However, the model underestimated daily water filled pore space, especially in dry seasons, and had difficulties in correctly estimating daily exchangeable NO3- and NH4+. Both observed and simulated cumulative N2O results showed that optimized and alternative cropping systems used less nitrogen fertiliser, increased grain yield and decreased N2O emissions compared to the conventional cropping system. Our study shows that although the DNDC model (v. 9.5) is not perfect in estimating daily N2O emissions for these long-term multi-cropping systems, it could still be an effective tool for predicting cumulative emissions.

AB Maize (Zea mays L.), a staple crop in the North China Plain, contributing substantially to agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in this region. Many studies have focused on various agricultural management measures to reduce N2O emissions. However, few have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems. In the current study, we investigate whether maize-soybean intercropping treatments could reduce N2O emission rates. Two differently configured maize-soybean intercropping treatments, 2:2 intercropping (two rows of maize and two rows of soybean, 2M2S) and 2:1 intercropping (two rows of maize and one row of soybean, 2M1S), and monocultured maize (M) and soybean (S) treatments were performed using a static chamber method. The results showed no distinct yield advantage for the intercropping systems. The total N2O production from the various treatments was 0.15 +/- 0.04-113.85 +/- 12.75 mu g m(-2) min(-1). The cumulative N2O emission from the M treatment was 16.9 +/- 2.3 kg ha(-1) over the entire growing season (three and a half months), which was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the 2M2S and 2M1S treatments by 36.6% and 32.2%, respectively. Two applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (as urea) at 240 kg N ha(-1) each induced considerable soil N2O fluxes. Short-term N2O emissions (within one week after each of the two N applications) accounted for 74.4%-83.3% of the total emissions. Soil moisture, temperature, and inorganic N were significantly correlated with soil N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.246-0.365, n = 192, P < 0.001). Soil nitrate (NO3-) and moisture decreased in the intercropping treatments during the growing season. These results indicate that maize-soybean intercropping can reduce soil N-2O emissions relative to monocultured maize.

AB Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in China has been the largest worldwide. Yet the impacts of atmospheric N deposition on soil N2O emissions were often ignored by previous studies. Thus, we investigated how N deposition affected N2O emissions over China using the process-based model (DNDC, DeNitrification-DeComposition). Total soil N inputs were 194 kg N ha(-1) in agricultural systems over China in 2010, including chemical N fertilizer (78%), atmospheric N deposition (12%), and crop residues N (10%). Annual N2O emissions induced by N deposition were estimated at 97 Gg N, occupying 43% of total soil N2O emissions (228 Gg N) in agricultural systems over China. In particular, the largest N2O emissions caused by atmospheric N deposition were found in South China, followed by North China Plain and Southwest China. The efficiency of N deposition generating N2O emissions (3.0%) over China was 4 times than that of N fertilizer (0.7%). N2O emissions induced by N deposition increased from 81 Gg in 2000 to 93 Gg in 2014 (by 1% yr(-1)), which was consistent with the long-term trend of N deposition. This suggests N deposition accelerated soil N2O emissions largely contributing to global warming. Our results also indicated that 62% and 10% of soil N2O emissions were reduced by applying a nitrification inhibitor and N fertilizer with 20% decrease. We highlight the significance of considering N deposition in determining total soil N2O emissions over China. The results provide an important scientific basis for the prediction of greenhouse effect caused by N deposition over China.

AB Nitrogen amendment followed by flooding irrigation is a general management practice fora wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain, which may favor nitrification and denitrification. Consequently, high emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are hypothesized to occur. To test this hypothesis, we performed year-round field measurements of N2O and NO fluxes from irrigated wheat-maize fields on a calcareous soil applied with all crop residues using a static, opaque chamber measuring system. To interpret the field data, laboratory experiments using intact soil cores with added carbon (glucose) and nitrogen (nitrate, ammonium) substrates were performed. Our field measurements showed that pulse emissions after fertilization and irrigation/rainfall contributed to 73% and 88% of the annual N2O and NO emissions, respectively. Soil moisture and mineral nitrogen contents significantly affected the emissions of both gases. Annual emissions from fields fertilized at the conventional rate (600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) totaled 4.0 +/- 0.2 and 3.0 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively, while those from unfertilized fields were much lower (0.5 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.4 +/- 0.05 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Direct emission factors (EF(d)s) of N2O and NO for the fertilizer nitrogen were estimated to be 0.59 +/- 0.04% and 0.44 +/- 0.04%, respectively. By summarizing the results of our study and others, we recommended specific EF(d)s (N2O: 0.54 +/- 0.09%; NO: 0.45 +/- 0.04%) for estimating emissions from irrigated croplands on calcareous soils with organic carbon ranging from 5 to 16 g kg(-1). Nitrification dominated the processes driving the emissions of both gases following fertilization. It was evident that insufficient available carbon limited microbial denitrification and thus N2O emission. This implicates that efforts to enhance carbon sink in calcareous soils likely increase their N2O emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a high spatial variation in N2O emission from agricultural fields and N2O emissions from fields cultivated with stalk-crops was generally measured in the interrow area. The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in seasonal N2O emissions between interrow soil and interrow + row soil, and to understand the effect of different fertilizers on N2O emissions in a maize-cultivated sandy loam soil in the North China Plain. The experiment included five treatments: organic manure (OM), half-organic manure N plus half fertilizer N (HOM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NK (NK) and control (CK). Cumulative N2O emission from interrow + row soil during the maize growth season was 0.84-122 kg N ha(-1) with an average of 0.98 kg N ha(-1) in the N-fertilized treatments, significantly higher than the 0.30-0.49 kg N ha(-1) from interrow soil. However, no significant difference was observed in the CK treatment. The measurement in interrow soil underestimated N2O emissions by 44-67%. This difference mainly occurred at the two peak emission periods following fertilizer application probably due to discrepancy in soil denitrification potential. Manure application more efficiently increased difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil than inorganic N fertilizer application. The higher NO concentration did not induce larger N2O emission from interrow soil in the NK treatment than in the NPK treatment, but did from interrow + row soil, resulting in greater difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil. It is suggested that measuring N2O emission solely from interrow soil could underestimate seasonal N2O emissions, and partly mask the effect of N fertilizer application rates on N2O emission in a maize-cultivated soil in the North China Plain.

AB The exchange fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) from a maize field with three different treatments were simultaneously measured using static and dynamic chambers in the North China Plain (NCP) from June 28 to October 11, 2009. The three treatments included control plot (CK, without crop, fertilization and irrigation), fertilizer N plot (NP) and wheat straw returning plus fertilizer N plot (SN). N-fertilizer application greatly stimulated the emissions of N2O, NOx and NH3, with durations of about 10 days for N2O and NO, and about 7 days for NH3. Fertilizer loss rates were 1.08% (NP plot) and 1.20% (SN plot) as N2O-N, were 1.93% (NP plot) and 0.76% (SN plot) as NO-N, and were 5.24% (NP plot) and 3.03% (SN plot) as NH3-N. In comparison with the NP plot, the significant low fertilizer loss rates as NO-N and NH3-N from the SN plot indicated that the wheat straw returning to the field could reduce NOx and NH3 emissions. The molar ratio of NO/N2O was greater than unity for most data during the pulse emission periods induced by fertilization, and thus, nitrification was the dominant process for N2O and NO emissions during these periods. Considering the significant amount (>80%) of N2O and NOx emissions occurred during the pulse emission periods, the emissions of NOx and N2O from the investigated field were mainly ascribed to nitrification process.

AB Intensive double cropping in the North China Plain has been challenged by serious environmental problems. Crop rotation is one of the important strategies for sustainable agriculture, which can reduce production risk and environmental impact. Yet, few studies have assessed enhanced crop rotation diversity on GHG emissions in the North China Plain. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and yields were measured from four cropping systems: (1) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) double cropping (WM); (2) peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and WM rotation (PWM); (3) ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), peanut and WM rotation (RCPWM); and (4) continuous cotton (C), to determine if enhanced crop rotation diversity can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve yields. The RCPWM, PWM and WM cropping system produced 11.9%, 15.7% and 32.4% higher net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), respectively, than the C cropping system each year by the soil-based method assessing the field productive process. From 2017 to 2018, in the same crop planting seasons, RCPWM had lower cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions, and produced similar peanut, wheat, and maize yields when compared to PWM. In 2018, PWM had higher cumulative N2O than WM during the wheat period, and they had similar seasonal cumulative N2O emissions during the maize period. Meanwhile, PWM produced lower cumulative CO2 emissions and higher wheat and maize yields. In 2019, RCPWM did not have significantly different seasonal cumulative N2O emissions and yield, but slightly higher soil CO2 emissions than C during the cotton season. The GHG emission intensity (GHGI) of the same crops was lower in RCPWM than in PWM during the peanut, wheat, and maize period or slightly higher than in the C treatment during cotton period. The results demonstrate that RCPWM could reduce soil N2O emissions when the same crops in PWM were compared due to less soil CO2 emissions that the previous cotton brought about. The RCPWM system did not show a lower soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate than the PWM and C systems. Therefore, increasing cotton into the peanut and wheat-maize rotation system (RCPWM) for more diversified system can help reduce soil GHG emissions without sacrificing yields.

AB No-tillage cropping can increase soil carbon (C) stocks and aggregation, and subsequently impact the internal nitrogen (N) cycle and gas loss. The N-15 pool dilution method was used to study gross N transformations, and relative proportions of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions derived from denitrification versus nitrification-related processes under long-term tillage systems (no-tillage, rotary tillage and conventional tillage) in the North China Plain. In-field incubation experiments were repeated in successive growing seasons during April-November in 2007. Gross mineralization rates for rotary and mouldboard plough tillage (3.6 +/- A 0.3-10.6 +/- A 1.5 mg N kg(-1) days(-1)) were significantly higher than for no-tillage (1.7 +/- A 0.8-6.8 +/- A 1.1 mg N kg(-1) days(-1)). Gross mineralization was positively correlated with soil moisture and temperature, as well as with microbial biomass N and C. However, there was no consistent tillage effect on gross nitrification, and gross nitrification was positively correlated with soil moisture, but not with gross mineralization and microbial biomass. N2O emissions were higher in no-tillage (NT) than for conventional tillage (CT) during May-August. The N-15 labelling indicated that 26-92 % of the N2O was directly derived from the soil ammonium (NH4 (+)) pool. Emission rates of N2O from both nitrification and denitrification were positively correlated with NH4 (+) supply as expressed by gross mineralization, but not correlated with supply of nitrate as expressed by gross nitrification. The fraction of nitrified N emitted as N2O was positively correlated with changes in soil moisture and varied within 0.01-2.51 aEuro degrees. Our results showed that the tillage management impact on gross N transformation was not consistent with N2O emission, and more detailed information on the controls over N2O formation needs to be sought.

AB Here, we report on a two-years field experiment aimed at the quantification of the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) from the dominant wheat maize double cropping system in North China Plain. The experiment had 6 different fertilization strategies, including a control treatment, recommended fertilization, with and without straw and manure applications, and nitrification inhibitor and slow release urea. Application of N fertilizer slightly decreased CH4 uptake by soil. Direct N2O emissions derived from recommended urea application was 0.39% of the annual urea-N input. Both straw and manure had relatively low N2O emissions factors. Slow release urea had a relatively high emission factor. Addition of nitrification inhibitor reduced N2O emission by 55%. We conclude that use of nitrification inhibitors is a promising strategy for N2O mitigation for the intensive wheat maize double cropping systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrifier denitrification (ND) is recognized as an important pathway for N2O production in agricultural soils, yet its contributions under different moisture contents are poorly quantified. Using an enriched dual isotope (N-15 - O-18) approach, we estimated N2O production from ND across eight moisture levels (40-120% water-filled pore space, WFPS) in a typical agricultural soil from the North China Plain. Total N2O flux began to increase when WFPS exceeded 70%, peaking at 100% WFPS, indicating substantial N2O emission potential in wet soils. In contrast, the N2O production from ND increased gradually from 40-70% WFPS, rose sharply from 70-90% WFPS, stabilized between 90-100% WFPS, and declined rapidly from 100-120% WFPS. ND contributed approximately 20%, 80%, and 30% of N2O emissions under low (40-50% WFPS), intermediate (60-70% WFPS), and high (80-120% WFPS) moisture conditions, respectively. Future contributions from ND may increase as irrigation and extreme rainfall events become more frequent under changing climates.

AB Straw return in combination with synthetic N fertilizer is considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield. Such practice, however, can considerably modify soil microbial activity and relative C and N availability, both of which are known to regulate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Minimizing these emissions per unit of crop yield is a prerequisite to minimize the environmental footprint of agricultural production and thus, a policy objective. In our study, we quantified N2O and NO emissions and determined fertilizer-N use efficiencies (NUE) and crop yields of two double-cropping (summer maize/Welsh onion-winter wheat) systems with and without straw incorporation in the North China Plain. Relative to the fertilized treatment without straw amendments, straw incorporation showed a significant inhibitory effect on annual N2O emissions from the maize-wheat system (-31%), but no significant effect was observed for the Welsh onion-wheat system. However, straw return significantly reduced annual NO emissions by >30% for both systems. Meanwhile, straw return in both systems significantly increased the NUE and crop yields by 34-47% and 7-16%, respectively, as compared to the treatment without straw additions. Across the double-cropping systems, annual direct emission factors of N2O, NO and N2O + NO were 0.37-0.57%, 0.08-0.78% and 0.57-1.36%, respectively. Furthermore, a negative relationship between direct emission factors of N2O + NO and crop NUE was observed, highlighting the importance of optimizing NUE for reducing environmental risks of a cropping system. When expressing emissions on a yield basis, straw return significantly reduced annual yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions by 15-42% for both systems. Overall, our results show that the combined application of crop straw and synthetic N fertilizer is a promising N management strategy for maximizing crop yields while mitigating N-trace gas emissions.

AB It is increasingly recognized that the addition of biochar to soil has potential to mitigate climate change and increase soil fertility by enhancing carbon (C) storage. However, the effect of biochar on yield and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from upland fields remains unclear. In this study, a one-year field experiment was conducted in an area of calcareous fluvo-aquic soil to assess and quantify the effect of maize straw biochar in reducing N2O loss during 2014-2015 in the North China Plain. Eight treatments were designed as follows: no nitrogen (N) fertilizer (control, CK); biochar application at rates of 3 (B3), 6 (B6) and 12 (B12) t ha(-1); chemical fertilizer (NPK) application at 200 kg N ha(-1) (F); and fertilizer plus biochar application at rates of 3 (FB3), 6 (FB6) and 12 (FB12) t ha(-1). Crop yield, N2O fluxes, soil mineral N concentrations, and soil auxiliary parameters were measured following the application of treatments during each season. During the maize growing season, N2O emission was 0.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1) under CK treatment, and increased to 0.88, 0.93 and 1.10 kg N2O-N ha(-1) under B3, B6 and B12, respectively. In contrast, N2O emissions were significantly reduced by 31.4-39.9% (P < 0.05) under FB treatments compared with F, and the N2O emission factor of the applied N was reduced from 1.36% under F to 0.71 -0.85% under FB. There was also a significant interaction effect of fertilizer and biochar on N2O emissions (P < 0.01). During the wheat growing season, biochar had no effect on N2O emissions regardless of the fertilizer regime. Biochar application did not affect maize yield; however, a significant increase in wheat yield of 16.6-25.9% (P < 0.05) was observed without N fertilization. Nevertheless, a reduction in wheat yield was measured at a biochar rate of 12 t ha(-1) with fertilization. Overall, under maize cropping, N2O emissions per unit yield of grain, biomass, grain N and biomass N (yield-scaled N2O emissions) were significantly reduced by 32.4-39.9% under FB compared with F treatment, regardless of the biochar application rate. Biochar did not affect yield-scaled N2O emissions in wheat. Decreased soil bulk density with biochar is suggested to reduce the denitrification potential and N2O emissions; while increased retention capacity of fertilizer N in biochar-added soil decreased wheat growth and yield. These findings suggest that N fertilization plus biochar application at 3 t ha(-1) is a practical strategy for reducing yield scaled N2O emissions from maize fields in the North China Plain.

AB Biogas slurry (BS) produced from anaerobic digestion of livestock manure can be benefit for crop yields and soil fertility in cropping systems as compared to sole synthetic fertilization, but its impact on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is inconsistent in the literatures. The North China Plain (NCP) serves as a vital agricultural region in China, contributing approximately 40 % of the nation's total wheat and maize production. However, owing to the lack of relevant field studies, the understanding of how BS affects crop yield and N2O emissions in NCP remains unclear. Here, we assessed the effects of BS substitution (0 % substitution, CF; 50 % substitution, 50%BS; 100 % substitution, 100%BS) on the amount and sources of N2O emissions by monitoring N2O fluxes combined with the isotopomer ratios of soil-derived N2O in the NCP. The results showed that, compared with the control, CF, 50 % BS, and 100 % BS significantly increased wheat grain yield by 66.1 %-67.9 % and silage maize yield by 46.3 %-53.3 %, respectively. Compared with CF, 50%BS reduced N2O emissions by 40.1 % in the wheat season and by 35.5 % maize season, while 100%BS reduced N2O emissions by 31.9 % in the wheat season and by 49.2 % in the maize season. Further site preference analysis revealed that nitrification and fungal denitrification together contributed to 40.3-44.9 % of the peak N2O emissions in CF, 50%BS, and 100%BS, with no significant differences in SP values among them. Compared with CF, 100%BS significantly reduced the copy numbers of AOBamoA, nirK, and nirS by 65 %, 41 %, and 35 %, respectively, which may be key factors in reducing N2O emissions. Our results showed that the partial substitution of chemical fertilizers with BS is an efficacious practice for maintaining crop yields while simultaneously reducing N2O emissions in the NCP.

AB The introduction of cover crops into monoculture systems to improve soil health has been widely adopted worldwide. However, little is known about the environmental risks and application prospects of different cover crops in spring maize (Zea mays L.) monocultures proposed in the North China Plain. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different winter cover crops on subsequent maize yield, soil fertility, and environmental risks of nitrogen (N) loss, and a questionnaire survey was conducted to examine factors influencing farmers' willingness to adopt cover crops in the North China Plain. Based on the same fertilization regime during the maize growing period, four winter cover crop treatments were set up, including bare fallow, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), February orchid (Orychophragmus violaceus), and winter oilseed rape (Brassica campestris L.). The results indicated that winter cover crops significantly increased subsequent maize yield and soil organic carbon, total N, and microbial biomass carbon and N compared with the bare fallow treatment. The incorporation of cover crops led to a negligible increase in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and had a very limited effect on ammonia (NH3) emissions. The incorporation of February orchid and winter oilseed rape decreased nitrate leaching compared with the hairy vetch treatment in the maize growing season. The N losses via N2O and NH3 emissions and N leaching accounted for 71%-84% of the N surplus. However, yield increase and environmental benefits were not the main positive factors for farmers to accept cover crops. Financial incentive was rated by 83.9% of farmers as an "extremely important" factor, followed by other costs, when considering winter cover cropping. These results indicate that the environmental benefits depend on the type of cover crop. Maintaining high levels of soil fertility and maize yield, providing sufficient subsidies, and encouraging large-area cultivation of cover crops are critical measures to promote winter cover cropping in the North China Plain.

AB Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring crop productivity simultaneously is a major challenge that demands the balance of the amounts of nitrogen (N) and straw (S) applied to agricultural soil. This study seeks to determine whether higher grain yields and lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions could be realized concomitantly by optimizing synthetic N rates and straw returning. The effect of fertilizer N rates and straw application on the inter-annual yield-scaled N2O emission variations was measured over a three-year period (2011-2014) in a maize-wheat cropping system on the North China Plain (NCP). Yield scaled N2O emissions were expressed as g N2O-N per Mg grain. Six treatments with three synthetic N levels (zero N [N-0], optimized N [N-opt] and conventional N [N-con]) and two straw management practices (straw removal [i.e., N-0, N-opt and N-con] and straw return [i.e., N-0 +S,N-opt +S and N-con + S]) were used. Optimized N (N-opt, N-opt + S) refers to the use of approximately 50% of the fertilizer N that is used in conventional farming practices (N-con, N-con +S), with no significant decrease in grain yields (P>0.05). Optimized N reduced cumulative N2O emissions by 18-37%, which in turn significantly decreased yield scaled N2O emissions by 38-42% (P < 0.05). The effects of fertilizer N rates and grain yields on cumulative N2O emissions are described by linear and exponential models, respectively. Straw return had a positive effect on mean yield-scaled N2O emissions both in the maize season and annually. Yield-scaled N2O emissions are constructive considering the trade-off between grain yield and N2O emission mitigation from intensive crop production. Optimized fertilizer N rate combined with straw return reduced yield scaled N2O emissions significantly in maize-wheat rotations. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Fertilized agricultural soil is a significant source of gaseous nitrogen compounds (GNCs), including N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3. The North China Plain (NCP) is the "hot region" for the release of these GNCs due to intensive fertilization practices. However, existing research has primarily focused on N2O emissions from fertilized farmland in the NCP, lacking comprehensive observational studies on other GNCs. Therefore, a continuous cumulative sampling technique (open-top dynamic chamber system) was utilized in this study to simultaneously measure the exchange fluxes of N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3 over summer maize-winter wheat rotation fields in the NCP. Results showed that GNC emissions from the soil displayed distinct diurnal variations, with higher emissions during the day attributed to elevated soil temperature. However, N2O emissions remained consistent between day and night, potentially influenced not only by soil temperature but also by soil humidity. Annual cumulative emissions and emission factors (EFs) for four GNCs were determined, indicating that N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions during the maize season were 1.38-2.37 times higher than those during the wheat season, with 98 % of HONO emissions occurring in the maize season. Additionally, the study first presented the annual HONO EFs of 0.36 +/- 0.03 % in fertilized farmland. Furthermore, a comparison revealed that the fluxes of N2O, NO, NH3, and HONO using the conventional single-point sampling method were 26.4 %, 13.9 %, and 8.10 % lower, and 7.86 % higher compared to the continuous cumulative sampling method recommended in this study. In general, this study provided precise measurements of GNC emissions from farmland, offering essential foundational data for modeling parameters and contributing to the formulation of regional air pollution prevention and control policies.

AB Ammonia (NH3) volatilization, denitrification loss, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission were investigated from an irrigated wheat-maize rotation field on the North China Plain, and the magnitude of gaseous N loss from denitrification and NH3 volatilization was assessed. The micrometeorological gradient diffusion method in conjunction with a Bowen Ratio system was utilized to measure actual NH3 fluxes over a large area, while the acetylene inhibition technique (intact soil cores) was employed for measurement of denitrification losses and N2O emissions. Ammonia volatilization loss was 26.62% of the applied fertilizer nitrogen (N) under maize, while 0.90% and 15.55% were lost from the wheat field at sowing and topdressing, respectively. The differences in NH3 volatilization between different measurement events may be due to differences between the fertilization methods, and to differences in climatic conditions such as soil temperature. Denitrification losses in the fertilized plots were 0.67%-2.87% and 0.31%-0.49% of the applied fertilizer N under maize and wheat after subtracting those of the controls, respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions in the fertilized plots were approximately 0.08%-0.41% and 0.26%-0.34% of the applied fertilizer N over the maize and wheat seasons after subtracting those of the controls, correspondingly. The fertilizer N losses due to NH3 volatilization were markedly higher than those through denitrification and nitrous oxide emissions. These results indicated that NH3 volatilization was an important N transformation in the, crop-soil system and was likely to be the major cause of low efficiencies with N fertilizer in the study area. Denitrification was not a very important pathway of N fertilizer loss, but did result in important evolution of the greenhouse gas N2O and the effect of N2O emitted from agricultural fields on environment should not be overlooked.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils play an important role in the global greenhouse gas budget. However, the response of N2O emissions from nitrogen fertilized agricultural soils to climate warming is not yet well understood. A field experiment with simulated warming (T) using infrared heaters and its control (C) combined with a nitrogen (N1) fertilization treatment (315 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and no nitrogen treatment (NO) was conducted over five years at an agricultural research station in the North China Plain in a winter wheat-soybean double cropping system. N2O fluxes were measured using static chambers about once every week during July 2009-June 2014. In the N1 treatment, warming decreased the soil moisture and N2O emissions in spring, autumn and winter and the annual cumulative emissions. Across all years, N2O fluxes were positively correlated with soil temperature and soil moisture. The effect of lower soil moisture on N2O fluxes exceeded that of higher temperature, leading to less N2O being released by the drier soils under warming. Nitrogen fertilizer increased N2O emissions without warming, but did not routinely increase N2O emissions under warming treatment. In the NO treatment, warming neither decreased soil water content nor N2O emissions. Temperature and nitrogen input had significant direct and antagonistic effects on cumulative N2O flux in the N1 treatment. The decrease in N2O emissions from N1 T was due to the significant decrease of soil water content, soil total nitrogen and organic matter, which consequently accelerated N cycle dynamics and advanced wheat growth.

AB Addressing concerns about mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while maintaining high grain yield requires improved management practices that achieve sustainable intensification of cereal production systems. In the North China Plain, a field experiment was conducted to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes during the maize (Zea mays L.) season under various agricultural management regimes including conventional treatment (CONT) with high N fertilizer application at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) and overuse of groundwater by flood irrigation, optimal fertilization 1 treatment (OPT1T), optimal fertilization 2 treatment (OPT2T), and controlled-release urea treatment (CRUT) with reduced N fertilizer application and irrigation, and a control (CK) with no N fertilizer. In contrast to CONT, balanced N fertilization treatments (OPT1T, OPT2T, and CRUT) and CK demonstrated a significant drop in cumulative N2O emission (1.70 v.s. 0.43-1.07 kg N ha(-1)), indicating that balanced N fertilization substantially reduced N2O emission. The values of the N2O emission factor were 0.42%, 0.29%, 0.32%, and 0.27% for CONT, OPT1T, OPT2T, and CRUT, respectively. Global warming potentials, which were predominantly determined by N2O emission, were estimated to be 188 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) for CK and 419-765 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) for the N fertilization treatments. Global warming potential intensity calculated by considering maize yield was significantly lower for OPT1T, OPT2T, CRUT, and CK than for CONT. Therefore, OPT1T, OPT2T, and CRUT were recommended as promising management practices for sustaining maize yield and reducing GHG emissions in the North China Plain.

TI Rainfall increasing offsets the negative effects of nighttime warming on
   GHGs and wheat yield in North China Plain
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of nighttime warming and rainfall increasing on crop productivity and soil greenhouse gas emissions are few studied. This study was conducted with a field experiment to investigate the effects of nighttime warming, rainfall increasing and their interaction on wheat grain yield, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during a winter wheat growing season in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that nighttime warming and rainfall increasing significantly altered soil temperature and moisture, and thus the CH4 and N2O emissions from the soil. Nighttime warming significantly promoted soil CH4 uptake by 21.2% and increased soil N2O emissions by 22.4%. Rainfall increasing stimulated soil N2O emissions by 15.7% but decreased soil CH4 uptake by 18.6%. Nighttime warming significantly decreased wheat yield by 5.5%, while rainfall increasing enhanced wheat yield by 4.0%. The results indicate that the positive effect of nighttime warming on CH4 uptake and negative effect on wheat yield can be offset by rainfall increasing in the NCP. Generally, rainfall increasing significantly raised the global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity induced by CH4 and N2O emissions. Overall, this study improves our understanding of agroecosystem C and N cycling in response to nighttime warming and rainfall increasing under future climate change.

AB Agricultural soil with fertilization is a main anthropogenic source for atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O fluxes from a maize-wheat rotation field in the North China Plain (NCP) were investigated for 4 successive years using the static chamber method. The annual N2O fluxes from the control (without fertilization) and fertilization plots were 1.5 +/- 0.2 and 9.4 +/- 1.7 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2008-2009, 2.0 +/- 0.01 and 4.0 +/- 0.03 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2009-2010, 1.3 +/- 0.02 and 5.0 +/- 0.3 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2010-2011, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 and 12.5 +/- 0.1 kgNha(-1) yr(-1) in 2011-2012, respectively. Annual direct emission factors (EFd's) in the corresponding years were 2.4 +/- 0.5 %, 0.60 +/- 0.01 %, 1.1 +/- 0.09% and 2.9 +/- 0.2 %, respectively. Significant linear correlation between fertilized-induced N2O emissions (Y, kgNha(-1)) during the periods of 10 days after fertilization and rainfall intensities from 4 days before to 10 days after fertilization (X, mm) in the 4 years was found as Y = 0.048X - 1.1 (N = 4, R-2 = 0.99, P < 0.05). Therefore, the remarkable interannual variations of N2O emissions and the EFd's were mainly ascribed to the rainfall.

AB Over-fertilization could lead to nitrogen (N) losses and environmental risks, and the appropriate nitrogen fertilizer could reduce the nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and increase the N utilization of crops in the North China Plain. We investigated the effects of rationally reduced N fertilizer input and nitrapyrin (CP) application on N2O dynamic emission, soil N balance, yield, N utilization and net income during the whole wheat season. Five fertilization treatments included zero N (CK), farmers' traditional N rate (FN), recommended N rate (RN), the 20% reduction of RN (80%RN) and the 20% reduction of RN added with CP (80%RN+CP). The N2O emission fluxes from seedling stage to greening stage contributed to 51.1%-74.2% during the whole wheat growth stages. Moreover, the first peak of N2O emission was observed within half a month after N basal fertilizer, irrigation, and sowing, which was two times higher than the other peaks occurred after N top-dressing and irrigation. The cumulative N2O emission and N2O emission factor were significantly declined by 27.3%-43.4% and 8.9%-51.1% with 80%RN and 80%RN+CP as compared to FN, respectively. Grain yield, agronomic N use efficiency, apparent N use efficiency and N production efficiency with 80%RN+CP were increased by 1.74%-10.83%, 0.9-8.91 kg kg(-1), 1.9%-27.5% and 1.22-22.79 kg kg(-1) than other N treatments, respectively. Moreover, 80%RN+CP also decreased N loss by 7.88-55.62 kg ha(-1) as compared to FN and RN, which resulted in less soil NO3- retention. Consequently, the application of nitrapyrin with 20% reduction of N rate should be recommended to increase winter wheat economic benefits and mitigate environmental pollution in North China Plain.

AB With increasing attention being placed on mitigating global warming and achieving agricultural sustainable intensification, conservation agriculture practices have gradually been implemented in the North China Plain (NCP). However, there are still knowledge gaps on the effects of conservation practices on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this area. In this study, a four-year field experiment was conducted from 2014 to 2018 to assess the effects of tillage and crop residue management practices on the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Subsequently, crop yields, area-scaled and yield-scaled total non-carbon dioxide (CO2) GHG emissions were assessed. Our research found that no till (NT) decreased N2O emissions by 22.6% compared with conventional tillage (CT) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seasons, but there was no difference between tillage practices in summer maize (Zea mays L.) seasons. Crop residue retention practice (+R) increased N2O emissions by 28.1% and 26.7% compared with residue removal practice (-R) in winter wheat and summer maize seasons, respectively. The NT soils took up more CH4 compared with the CT soils in summer maize seasons. Area-scaled total non-CO2 GHG emissions showed trends similar to those of N2O emission. Since crop residue retention improved the maize yield compared with the residue removal treatments, yield scaled total non-CO2 GHGs emission did not differ between residue management practices in summer maize seasons. Our four-year field measurements indicated that no-till practice could be more useful as an option to mitigate non-CO2 GHG emissions in the wheat - maize cropping system.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) has significant impact on global warming and leads to the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. Agricultural soil is regarded as a major source of N2O emissions. In recent years, greenhouse grown vegetables have rapidly developed in China. Although excessive fertilizer application in greenhouse vegetable production can result in increased N2O emissions, research data on such emissions from greenhouse vegetables, such as cucumber, remains limited. In this study, four nitrogen (N) fertilizer treatments including 1,200 (N-1200, traditional N amount), 900 (N-900), and 600 kg N ha(-1) (N-600) and the control (N-0) were carried out on cucumber in a greenhouse in the North China Plain. Results showed that N2O emissions mainly occurred in the first five days after topdressing, and accounted for 75.8%-95.2% of total N2O emissions produced in the whole interval (10 days). Significant exponential correlations were observed between N2O flux and nitrification or denitrification rates (P<0.01). The results also indicated that nitrification dominated and played a more important role in N2O emissions than denitrification under the irrigation conditions of the study (water-filled pore space was 40.0 to 66.6%). Cumulative N2O emissions were 0.48-5.01 kg N ha(-1) in the cucumber growing season, accounting for 0.28-0.38% of nitrogen input. Compared to N-1200, treatment N-600 significantly reduced the rate of N2O emissions by 53.4%, and also maintained cucumber yield. Based on this study, 50% of the traditional N fertilizer rate (N-600) was considered sustainable for greenhouse cucumber production in the North China Plain.

AB Greenhouse cucumber is one of the most popular crops in the North China Plain, and this highly productive crop is an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to the high fertilizer nitrogen and irrigation water inputs. However, a few researchers have reported on N2O emissions from greenhouse cucumber fields. In this study, six treatments including two irrigation levels (traditional, 747 mm (W1); 70% of the traditional irrigation water, 519 mm (W2)) and three N rates treatments (traditional, 1,200 kg N ha(-1) (N2); 75% of the traditional nitrogen, 900 kg N ha(-1) (N1); and no nitrogen input (N0)), were carried out on cucumber in greenhouses in the northern China plains. Results showed that the appropriate reduction of irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer could significantly reduce the N2O emissions. Compared with W1N2, the N2O emission peak of W2N1 was decreased by 45%-115% after nitrogen fertilizer application. The N2O fluxes were increased exponentially with the soil nitrate nitrogen content and WFPS increasing, but the effects of soil moisture on N2O flux was probably masked by the effects of fertilizer. Cumulative N2O emissions were ranged from 0.48 to 7.92 kg ha(-1) during the cucumber growing season, and 0.28%-0.60% (average 0.42%) of the nitrogen application rate was emitted as N2O-N. The improved management measures which have reduced the irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate by 30% and 25% respectively could make the N2O emissions decreased by 62.0% (P < 0.01) without the cost of cucumber yield. From this study, 70% of the traditional irrigation water and 75% of the traditional N fertilizer rate (W2N1) were considered as the sustainable combination for greenhouse cucumber in the North China plain.

AB To evaluate long-term effects of biochar addition and straw return (SR) on N2O fluxes in wheat-maize rotation system, a 2-year field experiment following a 7-year biochar addition and SR was investigated in an intensively managed agricultural soil in the North China Plain (NCP). Four treatments were included: 1) no biochar addition (CK); 2) biochar treatment with 4.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (C1); 3) biochar treatment with 9.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (C2); and 4) all the wheat/maize straw return (SR). The results showed the annual cumulative N2O emissions from C1 treatment were increased by 15.9-16.5%, while C2 treatment suppressed the annual cumulative N2O emissions by 22.8-26.3%. In comparison, straw return suppressed N2O emissions by 13.4-43.6% in the wheat season but increased N2O emissions remarkably by 45.3-53.9% in the maize season. Biochar addition enhanced the copies of AOA, AOB, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes, while straw return decreased the copies of AOB, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes at the high N2O emission period in the maize season. The production of N2O in the maize season was mainly driven by the AOB and nosZ genes, and by AOB gene in the wheat season. These results suggest that application of 9.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1) biochar is a more optimum agricultural strategy for reducing N2O emission in the wheat-maize system.

AB Besides regulating soil water movements and nitrogen cycling, water management practices, such as irrigation schedule and irrigation methods, also affects possibly soil emission rates of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas. The scale of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods affecting N2O emission from winter wheat (Triticurn aestivum L.) fields remains unclear. Hence, a field experiment with three irrigation schedule levels and three irrigation methods was conducted to estimate the N2O emission qualitatively from winter wheat fields by using static chamber method during April to May in 2017 and 2018 in the North China Plain (NCP). Three irrigation methods, i.e., sprinkler irrigation, surface drip irrigation, and flood irrigation were scheduled to irrigate the winter wheat immediately as the mean moisture of soil layer 0-100 cm depleted to 50%, 60% and 70% of the field capacity (FC). The research results show that both the irrigation schedule and irrigation methods influenced significantly (P < 0.05) N2O emissions, global warming potential of N2O emission (GWP(N2O)), grain yield, and water use efficiency (WUE). Surface drip irrigation at 60% FC, compared with sprinkler and flood irrigation at same schedule level, lowered substantially (P < 0.05) GWP N2O of 15-16% and 27-30%, improved grain yield of 5-8% and 6-7% and raised WUE of about 1-6% and 8-6% in 2017 and 2018 winter wheat season respectively. Relevant data also showed that the combination of surface drip irrigation and schedule level of 60% FC is reasonable to be recommended for winter wheat irrigation practice regarding better yield sustainability, higher WUE, and mitigating N2O emission in the NCP.

AB The emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from agricultural fields are a significant contribution to global warming. Understanding the mechanisms of N 2 O emissions from agricultural fields is essential for the development of N 2 O emission mitigation strategies. Currently, there are extensive studies on N 2 O emissions on the surface of agricultural soils, while studies on N 2 O fluxes at the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zones (ISU) are limited. Uncertainties exist regarding N 2 O emissions from the soil -shallow groundwater systems in agricultural fields. In this study, a three-year lysimeter experiment (2019 - 2020, 2022) was conducted to simulate the soilshallow groundwater systems under four controlled shallow groundwater depth (SGD) (i.e., SGD = 40, 70, 110, and 150 cm) conditions in North China Plain (NCP). Weekly continuous monitoring of N 2 O emissions from soil surface, N 2 O concentration in the shallow groundwater and the upper 10 cm of pores at the ISU, and nitrogen cycling -related parameters in the soil and groundwater was conducted. The results showed that soil surface N 2 O emissions increased with decreased shallow groundwater depth, and the highest emissions of 96.44 kg ha -1 and 104.32 kg ha -1 were observed at G2 (SGD = 40 cm) in 2020 and 2022. During the observation period of one maize growing season, shallow groundwater acted as a sink for the unsaturated zone when the groundwater depth was 40 cm, 70 cm, and 110 cm. However, when SGD was 150 cm, shallow groundwater became a source for the unsaturated zone. After fertilization, the groundwater in all treatment plots behaved as a sink for the unsaturated zone, and the diffusion intensity decreased with increasing SGD. The results would provide a theoretical basis for cropland water management to reduce N 2 O emissions.

AB Arable soil continues to be the dominant anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions owing to application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers and manures across the world. Using laboratory and in situ studies to elucidate the key factors controlling soil N2O emissions remains challenging due to the potential importance of multiple complex processes. We examined soil surface N2O fluxes in an arable soil, combined with in situ high-frequency measurements of soil matrix oxygen (O-2) and N2O concentrations, in situ N-15 labeling, and N2O N-15 site preference (SP). The in situ O-2 concentration and further microcosm visualized spatiotemporal distribution of O-2 both suggested that O-2 dynamics were the proximal determining factor to matrix N2O concentration and fluxes due to quick O-2 depletion after N fertilization. Further SP analysis and in situ N-15 labeling experiment revealed that the main source for N2O emissions was bacterial denitrification during the hot-wet summer with lower soil O-2 concentration, while nitrification or fungal denitrification contributed about 50.0% to total emissions during the cold-dry winter with higher soil O-2 concentration. The robust positive correlation between O-2 concentration and SP values underpinned that the O-2 dynamics were the key factor to differentiate the composite processes of N2O production in in situ structured soil. Our findings deciphered the complexity of N2O production processes in real field conditions, and suggest that O-2 dynamics rather than stimulation of functional gene abundances play a key role in controlling soil N2O production processes in undisturbed structure soils. Our results help to develop targeted N2O mitigation measures and to improve process models for constraining global N2O budget.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agro-ecosystem have been widely concerned as a hot issue. Tillage methods significantly affect GHG emissions in the farmland. This study was conducted on double cropping system of winter wheat and summer corn in North China with four treatments (conventional tillage CT, conventional tillage with straw retention CTS, no-tillage with straw retention NTS, rotary tillage with straw retention RTS). In order to study tillage effects on field GHG emissions, CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions fluxes were collected. Results showed that soils of each the treatment were net sources of CO2, but RTS and NTS consumed atmospheric CH4, while N2O emission exhibited high annual flux in all the treatments except RTS; soil moisture contents in NTS were maximum (19.3%) and significantly higher compared to the other treatments (at P<0.05 level); CO2 emission fluxes (g CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) were generally in the order of CTS (6460.3) > CT (5568.4) > RTS (5421.2) > NTS (4200.1); integrated evaluation of field greenhouse effect indicated that it was mainly caused by CO2, with CH4 and N2O as subsidiary components; total greenhouse effect under different tillage treatments was followed NTS < RTS < CT < CTS in North China Plain.

AB Winter irrigation is important for wheat in meeting crop water requirements in spring, but it alters soil moisture dynamics and affects soil N2O production and emission. To assess the effects of winter irrigation on soil N2O emissions in a winter wheat field, an in situ experiment was conducted from 1 October 2019 to 1 March 2020 with one control treatment (CK) and five levels of winter irrigation quantities (irrigated to 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% of the soil water holding capacity, namely WHC60-WHC100, respectively). The results showed that winter irrigation had an impact on soil N 2 0 emission. The emission peaks were not investigated immediately after winter irrigation, but at two days after, which were increased by 4.3-17.0 mu g.m(-2).h(-1) under WHC60-100 treatments compared to the CK. The cumulative N2O emissions after winter irrigation from WHC60-100 were 1.1-3.9 times higher than that of CK, indicating that the cumulative N2O emission has an increase trend with the increase of soil water content regulated by irrigations. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the correlation between soil N2O flux and soil temperature were moderate with correlation coefficients of about 0.65. While the correlation between soil N2O flux and soil water content was poor during the investigate winter season with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.08 and 0.25. Future studies should focus on the general N2O emission responses to winter irrigation and environmental factors with the support of experiment data from several winter seasons.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions occur as a consequence of the turnover of soil nitrogen (N), but gross N transformations and N2O production are often not studied in combination, so the relationships are poorly understood. Here, we quantified gross N transformations and the N2O production pathway of alkaline fluvo-aquic soils under different fertilization regimes collected from a long-term field experiment in the North China Plain and compared them with six acidic UK soils (one was alkaline for reference) with high soil organic carbon (SOC). We found that nitrification was the dominant N2O production pathway in the alkaline Chinese soil with a contribution of nitrification to N2O emissions (N2Onit) of 81%. By contrast, denitrification was the main N2O production pathway for the acidic UK soils with the contribution of denitrification to N2O emissions (N2Oden) of 66%. Long-term manure applications significantly increased N2Oden, compared to the synthetic N and no N treatments (25% vs. 18%). The N2Onit was positively correlated with gross autotrophic nitrification rates and pH but negatively correlated with gross N mineralization, SOC, soil total N content, and C:N ratios. Our findings highlight the importance of soil pH in controlling the N2O production in cropland soils, and suggest that the increased contribution of denitrification to N2O emissions should be considered, when increasing SOC through long-term manure and straw management for carbon sequestration and soil fertility improvement.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas that is released from agricultural ecosystems where nitrogen fertilizers are poorly used and contributes to global climate warming. Large nitrogen fertilizer inputs in summer maize fields on the North China Plain (NCP) lead to large N2O emissions. N2O emissions can be mitigated using 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), but the efficiency and microbial mechanisms of this mitigation at different nitrogen rates remain poorly understood. To evaluate the efficiency of N2O emission mitigation by DMPP at different nitrogen rates and to explore its mechanisms at the microbial level, we monitored the dynamic changes in mineral and N2O fluxes and analysed the abundance and community structure of ammonia oxidizers. We found that DMPP significantly inhibited the oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3-) and thus maintained NH(4)(+)concentrations but decreased the peak value of NO(3)(-)concentrations. Total N2O emissions were increased by 6.5-fold, 13.2-fold and 26.7-fold in fields with 112.5 kg N ha(-1), 225 kg N ha(-1)and 337.5 kg N ha(-1), respectively, compared with fields with no nitrogen applied. Nitrogen increased the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and decreased that of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), whereas DMPP exhibited the opposite effects. Therefore, AOB could be the dominant N2O emission contributors in nitrogen-treated soils. Sequencing results suggested that all AOB belong to theNitrosospiraandNitrosomonas nitrosagroups, and all AOA fell within theNitrososphaeragroup. In both AOB and AOA communities, changes in the second-largest cluster after the application of nitrogen fertilizer and DMPP were more pronounced than those in the largest cluster. The potential functional clusters of AOB and AOA wereNitrosospiracluster 3b andNitrososphaeracluster 4.1, respectively. This study showed that nitrogen and DMPP both affected the abundance and structure of ammonia-oxidizer communities, which may contribute to the variations in N2O emissions from croplands. Highlights
   Role of soil microorganisms in the efficiency of DMPP to reduce N2O emissions under different N inputs was explored. N input increased N2O emissions and DMPP reduced N2O emissions N and DMPP affect N2O emission via a changed key cluster of ammonia oxidizers. DMPP was more efficient at higher nitrogen input levels.

AB High-input agriculture in China has successfully increased crop productivity in the past decades, but at a significant environmental cost. It is essential to improve management strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental costs, while maintaining grain yields. However, there is a lack of studies to evaluate mitigation strategies under long-term climate variability. This paper combines field experimental data and soil-plant systems modeling to investigate the potential for improving water and nitrogen management of a wheat-maize double cropping system in North China Plain. The APSIM model was calibrated against the data and then applied to simulate crop yield and N2O emissions from soil in response to irrigation and nitrogen inputs. Our results show that the N fertilizer rate and irrigation amount under the local farmer practice could be reduced by 28% and 14% without sacrificing crop yield. This in turn led to a reduction in GHG emissions by 31%, mainly attributed to the decrease in emissions from the production and transportation of N fertilizer and direct N2O emissions from soil. Additionally, the results indicate that the direct N2O emissions from soil was positively correlated with N inputs, implying an increasing emission factor (N2O produced per unit of N input) with N application rates. It is concluded that potential exists to optimize N fertilizer rate and irrigation amount to reduce GHG emissions while still maintaining crop yield in the agro-ecosystems in North China Plain.

AB High nitrogen (N) inputs in Chinese vegetable and cereal productions played key roles in increasing crop yields. However, emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO) increased too. For lowering the environmental costs of crop production, it is essential to optimize N strategies to maintain high crop productivity, while reducing the associated N losses. We performed a 2 year-round field study regarding the effect of different combinations of poultry manure and chemical N fertilizers on crop yields, N use efficiency (NUE) and N2O and NO fluxes from a Welsh onion-winter wheat system in the North China Plain. Annual N2O and NO emissions averaged 1.14-3.82 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 5.54-13.06 g N kg(-1) N uptake) and 0.57-1.87 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 2.78-6.38 g N kg(-1) N uptake) over all treatments, respectively. Both N2O and NO emissions increased linearly with increasing total N inputs, and the mean annual direct emission factors (EFd) were 0.39% for N2O and 0.19% for NO. Interestingly, the EFd for chemical N fertilizers (N2O: 0.42-0.48%; NO: 0.07-0.11%) was significantly lower than for manure N (N2O: 1.35%; NO: 0.76%). Besides, a negative power relationship between yield-scaled N2O, NO or N2O + NO emissions and NUE was observed, suggesting that improving NUE in crop production is crucial for increasing crop yields while decreasing nitrogenous gas release. Compared to the current farmers' fertilization rate, alternative practices with reduced chemical N fertilizers increased NUE and decreased annual N2O + NO emissions substantially, while crop yields remained unaffected. As a result, annual yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions were reduced by > 20%. Our study shows that a reduction of current application rates of chemical N fertilizers by 30-50% does not affect crop productivity, while at the same time N2O and NO emissions would be reduced significantly.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agroecosystems are a major contributor to global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. However, knowledge concerning the hotspots and hot moments of soil N2O emissions with manure application and irrigation, as well as the underlying mechanisms remain incomplete. Here, a 3-year field experiment was conducted with the combination of fertilization (no fertilizer, F0; 100% chemical fertilizer N, Fc; 50% chemical N + 50% manure N, Fc + m; and 100% manure N, Fm) and irrigation (with irrigation, W1; and without irrigation, W0; at wheat jointing stage) for winter wheat - summer maize cropping system in the North China Plain. Results showed that irrigation did not affect annual N2O emissions of the wheat-maize system. Manure application (Fc + m and Fm) reduced annual N2O emissions by 25-51% compared with Fc, which mainly occurred during 2 weeks after fertilization combined with irrigation (or heavy rainfall). In particular, Fc + m reduced the cumulative N2O emissions during 2 weeks after winter wheat sowing and summer maize top dressing by 0.28 and 0.11 kg ha-1, respectively, compared with Fc. Meanwhile, Fm maintained the grain N yield and Fc + m increased grain N yield by 8% compared with Fc under W1. Overall, Fm maintained the annual grain N yield and lower N2O emissions compared to Fc under W0, and Fc + m increased the annual grain N yield and maintained N2O emissions compared with Fc under W1, respectively. Our results provide scientific support for using manure to minimize N2O emissions while maintaining crop N yield under optimal irrigation to support the green transition in agricultural production.

AB Irrigation management is one of most critical factors influencing soil N2O and CO2 emissions in dryland agriculture. To explore the effects of irrigation systems and levels on the mitigation of N2O and CO2 emissions from maize fields and to determine the balance among greenhouse gases (GHG) emission, water-saving and grain yield, a two-year field exper-iment was conducted in the North China Plain (NCP) during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019. Two irrigation systems (i.e., flood irrigation, FI, and drip irrigation, DI) were adopted with four irrigation levels in each system, including 65 mm/event (sufficient irrigation, CK), 50 mm/event (decreased by 23 %), 35 mm/event (by 46 %) and 20 mm/event (by 69 %), respectively. The results showed that both irrigation systems and levels had significant effects on soil N2O and CO2 emissions (P < 0.05). Nitrous oxide (N2O) and CO2 emissions peaked following irrigation or irri-gation + fertilization events during sowing to early filling stage (R1), with the peak values increasing with irrigation levels. Meanwhile, peak values from FI were higher than those from DI at 50 mm and 65 mm irrigation levels. The average cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions of DI treatments were 14.9 % and 6.23 % lower than those of FI treatments (P < 0.05), respectively. Soil moisture was identified as one of the most crucial factors influencing N2O and CO2 fluxes. Deficit irrigation efficiently deceased cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions, but moderate to severe deficit irrigation brought significant reduction in grain yield. Drip irrigation with a slight deficit irrigation level (decreased by 23 %) obtained the best economic and environmental benefits, which achieved the dual goal of lower GHG emissions but higher WUE without sacrificing grain yield.

AB N2O and NO emissions, the water usage and grain yields of a maize field in the North China Plain (NCP) under traditional flood irrigation, drip irrigation and drip fertigation were compared. With respect to the flood irrigation treatment, N2O emissions were reduced by 13.8% in the drip irrigation treatment and 7.7% in the drip fertigation treatment. NO emissions were reduced to 16.7% in the drip irrigation treatment but increased by 21.7% in the drip fertigation treatment. The molar ratios of NO/N2O within 2 days after each fertilization event were evidently greater from the drip fertigation treatment than from the flood irrigation treatment, indicating that nitrification was more intensive in the drip fertigation treatment than in the treatment of flood irrigation. Compared with the flood irrigation treatment, evident increase of the maize yields in the drip irrigation treatment (28%) and the drip fertigation treatment (3.7%) were found. Although the drip fertigation treatment could evidently increase NO emission, the 40% water reduction in drip fertigation is of great importance for the sustainable development of agriculture in the NCP where water resources are extremely limited. To mitigate NO emissions from agricultural fields in the NCP with drip fertigation, the addition of a nitrification inhibitor combined with N or nitrate fertilizer was recommended.

AB The production and consumption of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in soil profile are poorly understood. This work sought to quantify the GHG production and consumption at seven depths (0-30, 30-60, 60-90, 90-150, 150-200, 200-250 and 250-300 cm) in a long-term field experiment with a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system, and four N application rates (0; 200; 400 and 600 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) in the North China Plain. The gas samples were taken twice a week and analyzed by gas chromatography. GHG production and consumption in soil layers were inferred using Fick's law. Results showed nitrogen application significantly increased N2O fluxes in soil down to 90 cm but did not affect CH4 and CO2 fluxes. Soil moisture played an important role in soil profile GHG fluxes; both CH4 consumption and CO2 fluxes in and from soil tended to decrease with increasing soil water filled pore space (WFPS). The top 0-60 cm of soil was a sink of atmospheric CH4, and a source of both CO2 and N2O, more than 90% of the annual cumulative GHG fluxes originated at depths shallower than 90 cm; the subsoil (>90 cm) was not a major source or sink of GHG, rather it acted as a 'reservoir'. This study provides quantitative evidence for the production and consumption of CH4, CO2 and N2O in the soil profile.

AB Ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are two important air pollutants that have major impacts on climate change and biodiversity losses. Agriculture represents their largest source and effective mitigation measures of individual gases have been well studied. However, the interactions and trade-offs between NH3 and N2O emissions remain uncertain. Here, we report the results of a two-year field experiment in a wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain (NCP), a global hotspot of reactive N emissions. Our analysis is supported by a literature synthesis of global croplands, to understand the interactions between NH3 and N2O emissions and to develop the most effective approaches to jointly mitigate NH3 and N2O emissions. Field results indicated that deep placement of urea with nitrification inhibitors (NIs) reduced both emissions of NH3 by 67% to 90% and N2O by 73% to 100%, respectively, in comparison with surface broadcast urea which is the common farmers' practice. But, deep placement of urea, surface broadcast urea with NIs, and application of urea with urease inhibitors probably led to trade-offs between the two gases, with a mitigation potential of -201% to 101% for NH3 and -112% to 89% for N2O. The literature synthesis showed that deep placement of urea with NIs had an emission factor of 1.53%-4.02% for NH3 and 0.22%-0.36% for N2O, which were much lower than other fertilization regimes and the default values recommended by IPCC guidelines. This would translate to a reduction of 3.86-5.47 Tg N yr(-1) of NH3 and 0.41-0.50 Tg N yr(-1) of N2O emissions, respectively, when adopting deep placement of urea with NIs (relative to current practice) in global croplands. We conclude that the combination of NIs and deep placement of urea can successfully tackle the trade-offs between NH3 and N2O emissions, therefore avoiding N pollution swapping in global croplands.

AB Salt-affected arable land is distributed widely in China, especially in the North China Plain. Crop residue management under appropriate tillage is critical to improving salt-affected soil organic carbon and reducing the carbon footprint. This study conducted four-year field experiments including two treatments (residue incorporated into soil with plough tillage (CT+); residue mulching with no-till (NT+)) in two sites (non-saline soil and salt-affected soil); the carbon footprint of wheat production was analyzed by life cycle assessment. The results showed that the carbon footprint of wheat production in the salt-affected soil was significantly larger than that in the non-saline soil, because the salt-affected soil exhibited higher N2O emission than the non-saline soil. CT+ has lower carbon footprint than the NT+, mainly due to the lower N2O emission and higher carbon sequestration in the CT+ compared to NT+. As for the salt-affected soil, the largest contributor of the carbon footprint per unit area was soil N2O emission, with a relative contribution of 40%; the largest contributor of the carbon footprint per unit yield was carbon sequestration, with a relative importance of 47-50%. Our results indicated that wheat production in salt-affected land has a high carbon footprint, while it can be decreased by incorporating crop residue into the soil under the plough tillage.

AB Requirements for mitigation of the continued increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are much needed for the North China Plain (NCP). We conducted a meta-analysis of 76 published studies of 24 sites in the NCP to examine the effects of natural conditions and farming practices on GHG emissions in that region. We found that N2O was the main component of the area-scaled total GHG balance, and the CH4 contribution was <5%. Precipitation, temperature, soil pH, and texture had no significant impacts on annual GHG emissions, because of limited variation of these factors in the NCP. The N2O emissions increased exponentially with mineral fertilizer N application rate, with y=0.2389e(0.0058x) for wheat season and y=0.365e(0.0071x) for maize season. Emission factors were estimated at 0.37% for wheat and 0.90% for maize at conventional fertilizer N application rates. The agronomic optimal N rates (241 and 185kgNha(-1) for wheat and maize, respectively) exhibited great potential for reducing N2O emissions, by 0.39 (29%) and 1.71 (56%)kgN(2)O-Nha(-1)season(-1) for the wheat and maize seasons, respectively. Mixed application of organic manure with reduced mineral fertilizer N could reduce annual N2O emissions by 16% relative to mineral N application alone while maintaining a high crop yield. Compared with conventional tillage, no-tillage significantly reduced N2O emissions by 30% in the wheat season, whereas it increased those emissions by 10% in the maize season. This may have resulted from the lower soil temperature in winter and increased soil moisture in summer under no-tillage practice. Straw incorporation significantly increased annual N2O emissions, by 26% relative to straw removal. Our analysis indicates that these farming practices could be further tested to mitigate GHG emission and maintain high crop yields in the NCP.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the most important greenhouse gases emitted from fertilized agricultural soils. Vegetable fields, mostly managed under intensive mode with higher rate nitrogen application, frequent irrigation, and multiple planting-harvest cycles, does contribute to national GHG inventory greatly due to the increasing planting area in China. N2O emissions from four different fields a maize field (maize), a newly established open-ground vegetable field converted from a maize field four years earlier (OV4), an established open-ground vegetable field converted from a maize field more than 20 years ago (OV20), and an established sunlight heated greenhouse vegetable field converted from a maize field more than 20 years ago (GV20) with four different fertilization treatments for the OV4 field were measured using the closed chamber method between March 15th, 2012 and March 14th, 2013 in suburban area of Beijing, North China Plain. Results showed that the annual N2O emissions from vegetable fields were 3.1-4.6 times higher than the typical maize field. All the N2O emission peaks were occurred after fertilization and the fertilization associated emissions accounted for 81.1% (ranging from 77.0% to 87.2%) of the annual N2O emission with 22.2% time duration in the whole year for vegetable fields. Both the occurrence data and duration of N2O emission peaks were associated with N input type (chemical or manure) and the application rate. The N2O emission peaks appeared earlier (on the 3rd day after application) and lasted shorter when only chemical N was applied; while they appeared later (on the 7th to 10th day after application) and lasted longer when the combination of manure and chemical N were applied. The magnitudes of N2O emission peaks increased when the N application rate was higher. Dicyandiamide (DCD) decreased N2O emissions by 30.1% and 21.1% in the spring cucumber and autumn cabbage seasons respectively (averaged of 24.7% over the whole year). Calculations showed that it is critical to estimate the emission factor (EF) by N type in order to decrease the uncertainty of regional N2O emissions when using EF as calculation method. EFs were 0.20% and 0.42% for manure N in the cucumber and cabbage seasons respectively; and were 0.55-1.30% and 0.8-1.59% for chemical N in the cucumber and cabbage seasons respectively.

AB Improving nitrogen (N) efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are dual challenges of the agricultural sector in the North China Plain (NCP). Most relevant studies conducted in the NCP lasted only 1-2 years without sufficiently addressing the temporal variations of weather conditions and farming practices over different seasons. Thus, a 4-year (2008-2012) field experiment was conducted for a wheat-maize cropping system in a typical intensive agricultural region of the NCP. The three N application rates were (a) control without N application (CK); (b) farmers' conventional N fertilization (CON), i.e., 600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); and (c) optimized N fertilization (OPT), i.e., 420 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), N uptake and crop production were measured. Compared with CON, the annual cumulative N2O emissions from OPT decreased by 40.9%, 7.2%, and 223% during the 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 rotation years, respectively. Basal N fertilization in the wheat season was the critical period for N2O mitigation, although the maize season contributed 51%-89% of the annual N2O emission. CH4 uptake (CO2-equivalent) via soil accounted for 60%-96% of N2O in CK treatment and 4%-48% in fertilization treatments, indicating that CH4 should be considered in the overall GHG emissions from crop production. Compared with CON, OPT significantly improved N efficiency by 46%-52% for wheat and maize and maintained a similar or higher crop yield. Improvements in N efficiency should focus on the maize season. Water saving practices exhibited high potential to reduce indirect GHG emissions for the entire life cycle of crop production. Compared with CON, OPT significantly reduced the GHG intensity, particularly in the wheat season. Future long-term field experiments are required to account for considerable variations in GHG emissions and crop production under field conditions in the NCP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and carbon (C) sequestration are important processes for determining net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maize fields. Farming management practices (FMPs) substantially affect crop productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), and N2O emissions. However, relative knowledge is not sufficient, and further research is required for sustainable agriculture development. A multiyear experiment was performed on a spring maize field in the North China Plain (NCP) to quantify changes in SOC stocks, N2O emissions, and maize yields. Seven treatments were involved in the experiment, including no N fertilization (CK), farmers' conventional N fertilization (FP), sole application of manure N (M), a combination of M and FP (MFP), FP combined with returned maize straw (SFP), fertilization with reduced synthetic N amount (RN), and fertilization with both reduced synthetic and manure N (RMN). The field measurements demonstrated that urea applications and returned maize straw increased N2O emission. The seasonal total N2O emissions under FP were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those under CK by 176% to 222% and lower than those under SFP by 20% to 61% throughout the three maize growing seasons. The application of organic manure or maize straw enhanced SOC storage for the studied cropping system. The SOC stocks were relatively high in the plots that received applications of organic manure or maize straw, with the SOC stock of the M plot being significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the CK, FP, SFP, RN, and RMN plots in 2016 after eight years of manure amendments. The average net GHG emission from 2012 to 2014 was 203 kg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) year(-1) (i.e., a net GHG source) under FP. The other treatments converted the maize fields from net GHG sources to GHG sinks. By considering both the maize yields and net GHG emissions, RMN would be an optimal management option, although MFP, SFP, and RN also mitigated the GHG emissions and maintained the yields. Large variations were observed in the contributions of the SOC changes and N2O emissions to net GHG emissions among the treatments. The large variations demonstrate the need to consider both SOC changes and N2O emissions when evaluating the impacts of alternative FMPs on net GHG emissions.

AB Microsensors are able to accurately quantify nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in microenvironments at high spatiotemporal resolution: yet, limited studies have been conducted on agricultural soils due to the inability to obtain electrical signal under conditions of low soil moisture. This study improved the calibration of a microelectrode for measuring N2O emissions from agricultural soil. The microelectrode was applied to evaluate the effect of long-term fertilization with mineral fertilizer (NPK), complemented with pig manure (MNPK), straw (SNPK), or without fertilizer (CK), all with and without urea addition, on N2O emissions from the soil, with explicit separation of the rhizosphere and the bulk soil compartments. The use of soil solution instead of pure water for calibration of the microelectrode doubled the signal and significantly improved the sensor sensitivity. The optimal electrolytic concentration of the soil solution, expressed as water: soil ratio, was found at the maximum vertex of the quadratic equation fitted on the slope values of the calibration equations for different soil solutions. The application of the calibrated microelectrode revealed significantly higher N2O emission from the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil, accounting for 60% of the total emission. For the bulk soil, MNPK significantly increased N2O emissions compared to SNPK and NPK, whereas the differences between these treatments for the rhizosphere soil were insignificant. The statistical modeling revealed significant relation of the N2O emission with soil inorganic nitrogen contents and an additive effect of treatment (MNPK and SNPK), urea addition and rhizosphere soil. This study provides novel insights into the use of microelectrodes for measuring N2O emissions from the soil microenvironment and also points on the rhizosphere compartment and the management practices of agroecosystems able to reduce the N2O emission from agriculture.

AB Severe ozone (O-3) pollution has been a major air quality issue and affects environmental sustainability in China. Conventional mitigation strategies focusing on reducing volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides (NOx) remain complex and challenging. Here, through field flux measurements and laboratory simulations, we observe substantial nitrous acid (HONO) emissions (F-HONO) enhanced by nitrogen fertilizer application at an agricultural site. The observed F-HONO significantly improves model performance in predicting atmospheric HONO and leads to regional O-3 increases by 37%. We also demonstrate the significant potential of nitrification inhibitors in reducing emissions of reactive nitrogen, including HONO and NOx, by as much as 90%, as well as greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide by up to 60%. Our findings introduce a feasible concept for mitigating O-3 pollution: reducing soil HONO emissions. Hence, this study has important implications for policy decisions related to the control of O-3 pollution and climate change.

AB Fertilized soil is an essential source of atmospheric gaseous nitrogen compounds (GNC, including N2O, 2 O, NO, HONO, and NH3) 3 ) that play important roles in global warming and regional air pollution. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the exchange fluxes of these gases between soil and the atmosphere, let alone exploration of mitigation measures. Herein, the fluxes of N2O, 2 O, NO, HONO, and NH3 3 under different fertilization treatments (surface fertilization (SF), deep fertilization (DF), DF with added nitrification inhibitor (DN), and control (CK, non-fertilization)) were comparatively investigated by open-top dynamic chambers in a maize field in the North China Plain (NCP) in 2022. The results showed that fertilization significantly promoted soil GNC emissions under SF and DF treatments, while there was no significant increase in GNC emissions except for NH3 3 under the DN treatment after fertilization. In comparison to the SF treatment, the cumulative emissions under the DF treatment exhibited a significant reduction, amounting to 80.8% for N2O, 2 O, 89.4% for NO, 88.3% for HONO, 84.8% for NH3, 3 , and 83.9% for the total emissions of these four gases. These results emphasize the effect of fertilizer deep placement in mitigating soil GNC emissions, and further reductions were observed when using nitrification inhibitors like dicyandiamide (DCD). Compared with the cumulative emissions under the SF treatment, the DN treatment showed reductions exceeding 95% for N2O, 2 O, NO, and HONO, and 77.1% for NH3 3 due to the inhibition of ammonia oxidation by DCD, resulting in an overall reduction of 88.8% for the four gases. Therefore, we advocate deep placement of fertilizer with or without nitrification inhibitors during crop cultivation to achieve a comprehensive reduction in GNC emissions and improve regional air quality.

AB N2O and NO emissions from a winter wheat-summer maize rotation field in the North China Plain were comparably investigated under three different treatments: 1) flood irrigation (A-Flood treatment) plus fertilization of NH4Cl, 2) drip fertigation (A-Drip treatment) plus fertilization of NH4Cl and 3) drip fertigation (AN-Drip treatment) plus fertilization of a mixture of Ca(NO3)(2) and NH4Cl. The annual N2O cumulative emissions from the A-Drip treatment and the A-Flood treatment were almost identical, whereas it from the AN-Drip treatment was significantly lower (33%) than that from the A-Flood treatment. Compared with the A-Flood treatment, the annual NO cumulative emission from the A-Drip treatment was significantly increased by 140% but it from the AN-Drip treatment was only slightly increased by 14%. Compared with drip fertigation with NH4Cl, drip fertigation with the mixture of Ca(NO3)(2) and NH4Cl significantly reduced the cumulative emissions of N2O (31%) and NO (52%) from the nitrification dominated fields by decreasing the supplement of NH4+ substrate. Among the three fertilization treatments, the yields of the maize from the A-Drip and AN-Drip treatments were significantly increased, while the yields of the wheat were almost the same. Considering the benefit of increasing yields and reducing N fertilizer and water input, the application of nitrate-based fertilizer instead of partial ammonium-based fertilizer through drip fertigation could be a promising method for keeping agronomic productivity and environmental sustainability.

AB Recent 15nitrogen (N) tracing studies have shown that unlabeled N2O emissions (UNEs) following 15N fertilizer application tend to be higher than those from zero-N controls, which indicates a potential risk for elevated N2O emissions from native soil. However, researchers do not clearly understand whether these increased UNEs are derived from a priming effect or how interactions between N in fertilizer and native soil affect various sources of N2O emissions. Here, we combined 15N tracing and 15N pool dilution in an incubation study to track gross N transformations, specific sources of N2O emissions, and N2O-production pathways following N fertilization. Four treatments, including two fertilizer N levels (0 and 120 mg N kg(-1)) in conjunction with two native soil N levels (0.56 and 1.25 g kg(-1)), were established in the study. Soil gross N mineralization (GM) increased by 33.0%- 98.5% (4.59-14.97 mg N kg(-1)) after N fertilizer addition, which indicated a positive priming effect on soil N turnover and resulted in additional native soil N-derived N2O emissions. In addition to priming GM, the pool substitution effect after 15N addition, which was not triggered by stimulated soil N turnover, also generated substrates for the UNEs. Therefore, overlooking the pool substitution effect might overestimate native soil N-derived emissions by 104%-180%. Differentiation of the specific N2O emission sources showed that both the fertilizer N-and primed native soil N-derived N2O emissions were dominated by nitrifier-mediated processes, which were governed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. At a specified N fertilizer addition rate, soils with higher native N levels had greater levels of fertilizer N-and native soil N-derived N2O emissions due to the higher GM and gross nitrification rates. The study reveals that fertilizer N application triggers potential N2O emissions from native soil N by stimulating the GM and nitrifier-mediated N2O-production processes.

AB N2O and NO emissions from a winter wheat-summer maize rotation field with five different treatments in the North China Plain (NCP) were comparably investigated from 8 October 2014 to 11 October 2015. Compared with the treatments with only flood or drip irrigation, evident emission peaks of N2O and NO from the fertilization treatments with flood irrigation (A-Flood) and with drip fertigation (A-Drip) were observed after each fertilization event, whereas their emissions from the fertilization treatments with nitrification inhibitors under drip fertigation (A + DCD-Drip and A + Nitrapyrin-Drip) were greatly suppressed. The reduction effect of the nitrification inhibitors on N2O and NO emissions was found to be more conspicuous during the maize season than during the wheat season, implying that the soil temperature could play an important role in the reduction effect. Compared with the A-Flood treatment, the annual cumulative emission from the A-Drip treatment reduced by 22% for N2O and increased by 18% for NO, whereas the reductions of N2O and NO from the treatments with nitrification inhibitors could achieve as high as 66% and 95%, respectively. The yields of the maize were significantly greater from the A-Drip and A + Nitrapyrin-Drip treatments than from the A-Flood treatment, and the yields of the wheat were almost same among the treatments of A-Flood, A-Drip and A + DCD-Drip. Considering the yields, the water saving and the reduction of N2O and NO emissions, the application of nitrification inhibitor combined with drip fertigation is recommended in the NCP.

AB Biochar (BC) application to low fertility soils is a promising approach to increase crop yield, improve soil quality, and mitigate climate change simultaneously. Only few studies evaluated the combined effects of BC and nitrogen (N) fertilization rates on crop productivity and N losses under field conditions. The objectives were to investigate combined effects of BC (2 rates) and N (5 rates) fertilization on crop productivity and N losses in a long-term field experiment started in 2008 in a winter wheat/summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain. Linear-plateau models best described the responses of wheat and maize yields to N rates. N2O fluxes, NH3 volatilization, and soil mineral N contents increased exponentially with N fertilization rates. Despite the effect of BC on wheat or maize yields was negligible, BC retains of mineral N at 240 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). BC application increased NH3 volatilization by 31% in wheat season and 26% in maize season because of pH increase. BC reduced N2O emissions by 8-23% in the wheat season and by 24% at lower N rates (<= 60 kg ha(-1)) in the maize season, due to BC induced complete denitrification to N-2. BC stimulated N2O emissions by 18-26% compared to soils without BC in maize season at N rates higher than 60 kg ha(-1). The combination of increased mineral N retention and C availability with BC addition increased nitrification and/or denitrification rates, leading to increased N2O emissions. For the wheat/maize rotation system, BC application decreased N2O emissions at lower N rates (<= 120 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) but had no effects at higher N rates. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of the continuous application of organic and mineral N fertilizer on N2O and NO emissions under maize and wheat rotation on the North China Plain. This study included eight treatments: no fertilizer (control); mineral N fertilizer (Nmin) at a rate of 200 kg N ha(-1) per season; 50% mineral fertilizer N plus 50% cattle manure N (50% CM), 50% chicken manure N (50% FC) or 50% pig manure N (50% FP); 75% mineral fertilizer N plus 25% cattle manure N (25% CM), 25% chicken manure N (25% FC) or 25% pig manure N (25% FP). The annual N2O and NO emissions were 2.71 and 0.39 kg N ha(-1), respectively, under the Nmin treatment, with an emission factor of 0.50% for N2O and 0.07% for NO. Compared with the Nmin treatment, N2O emissions did not differ when 50% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (50% CM, 50% FC and 50% FP), while annual NO emissions were significantly reduced by 49.0% and 27.8% under 50% FC and 50% FP, respectively. In contrast, annual N2O emissions decreased by 21-38% compared to the Nmin treatment when 25% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP). Most of the reduction occurred during the maize season. The 25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP treatments had no effect on NO emissions compared to the Nmin treatment. There was no obvious difference in annual N2O and NO emissions among the organic manures at the same application rate, probably due to their similar C/N ratio. Replacing a portion of the mineral fertilizer N with organic fertilizer N did not significantly affect crop grain yield, except for the 50% FC treatment in the wheat season. Overall, the results suggest that the combined application of 25% organic manure N plus 75% mineral fertilizer N had the most potential to mitigate N2O emissions while not affecting crop yield in the maize and wheat rotation system in this area of China.

AB Agriculture is an important N2O emissions source. Water cycle and nitrogen cycles have important effects on N2O in farmland ecosystems. The changes in the groundwater table can lead to changes in farmland the water and nitrogen cycle processes. However, how this such changes will affect N2O emissions from farmland remains unclear. In this study, a two-year volume lysimeter experiment (2019-2020), including four controlled groundwater tables (i.e., 40, 70, 110, and 150 cm), was performed to monitor the variations in the NO3- and N2O concentrations in shallow groundwater as well as the direct N2O emissions due to surface soil and groundwater evaporation. Our results showed that N2O emissions during fertilization accounted for 80%-90% of the total N2O emissions throughout the maize growing period. Direct N2O emissions increase with the increase in the groundwater table. The total N2O emissions in 2020 were 96.44, 9.75, 6.46, and 6.22 kg ha(-1) y(-1) at a groundwater table of 40, 70, 110, and 150 cm, respectively. The high water-filled pore space (WFPS) value resulting from the elevated groundwater table increased the groundwater-atmosphere connectivity, leading to significantly increased N2O emissions after fertilization. Increased precipitation (454.90 mm in 2020 vs. 180.30 mm in 2019) accelerated the hydrological processes in agroecology, reducing the retention time of N2O (6 weeks in 2020 vs. 7.5 weeks in 2019) and NO3- (6.75 weeks in 2020 vs. 7.25 weeks in 2019) in shallow groundwater. Studying the influence of shallow groundwater tables on direct N2O emissions will provide insights into the interaction between the water and nitrogen cycles in agroecosystems. The results of this study suggest that direct N2O emissions can be effectively reduced by controlling the groundwater table in agricultural fields in the North China Plain. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of no-tillage on carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural systems, there is still no consensus on the balance between the potential of C sequestration and nitrous oxide (N2O) or nitric oxide (NO) emissions. A no-tillage field experiment in the North China Plain was established in 2006 and the influence of no-tillage on N2O and NO emissions was monitored under an annual wheat-maize cropping system. The study included four treatments: no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) soils amended with N fertilizer at a rate of 225 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and 195 kg N ha(-1) for maize (NTN and CTN) and without N fertilizer (NT0 and CT0). Three years of no-tillage significantly (p < 0.05) increased soil organic C (SOC) content by 12.2% in the 0-5 cm soil layer, possibly due to the surface aggregation of organic C derived from crop roots and exudates, but did not alter SOC pool in the 0-30 an profile. Annual N2O emissions in the NT0 and CT0 treatments were 0.53 and 0.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively, and were significantly (p < 0.05) increased to 0.96 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in CTN and to 1.23 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in NTN. Remarkable differences in N20 emissions between CTN and NTN were observed during the maize growing season. In contrast, NO emissions were not affected by the tillage regimes regardless of N fertilization. The mean ratios of NO/N2O fluxes in N-unfertilized plots were 0.26-0.29 and 1.79-2.11 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, indicating that both NO and N2O were primarily derived from denitrification during the maize growing season and from nitrification under wheat cultivation. Under N-fertilized plots, the ratios increased to 1.44-2.02 and 5.00-6.03 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, with significantly (p < 0.05) lower values in NTN plots than in CTN plots. The N2O emission factors for N applied in the wheat-maize rotation system were 0.16% and 0.09% for NTN and CTN, respectively, which was far lower than the IPCC Tier 1 default value (1.0%), primarily due to the absence of irrigation after fertilization in maize season and low temperature in wheat season. The results suggest that the 3-year no-tillage regime with residue removal did not substantially increase C storage in the 0-30 cm profile, but stimulated N2O emissions primarily by increasing denitrification.

AB Crop straw return can not only affect soil fertility & crop productivity, but also influence nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the optimal straw return methods that ensure high yield and NUE (grain yield/total N uptake, %) with less N2O emissions remain inadequately understood. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment in the North China Plain to investigate the integrated effects of maize straw return on wheat yield, NUE and N2O emissions with five treatments: straw removal (CK), straw mulch (SM), straw mixed evenly into the 0-10 cm soil layer (SR10), straw mixed evenly into the 0-20 cm soil layer (SR20), and straw mixed evenly with the 0-10 cm soil and then the mixture incorporated into the 10-20 cm soil layer (TB). Results showed that maize straw return significantly increased wheat yield compared to straw mulch, with the method of TB achieving the highest yield (10.63 Mg ha(-1)) and NUE (32.97). TB also improved soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N (TN) at the 10-20 cm soil layer, with TN increased by 24.89 % on average compared with SM, promoting soil N uptake by wheat plant and reducing N2O emissions. Conversely, straw mulch or mixed into 0-10 cm soil layer triggered cumulative N2O emissions by 22.33 % and 20.39 % compared to TB, respectively, particularly during the early growing stages, due to enhanced nitrification microbial activity and reduced substrate supply for denitrification. TB reduced yield-scaled N2O emissions by 27.6-29.4 % compared with straw mulch. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that effects of straw return on soil chemical properties (r = 0.37, P < 0.001) and denitrification microbial activity (r = 0.62, P < 0.001) were key drivers of N2O emissions. These findings highlight that stratified incorporation of straw-soil mixtures is a promising strategy to balance wheat yield, NUE, and N2O mitigation in intensive wheat-maize cropping systems in the North China Plain.

AB Agricultural soils are main sources and sinks of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The source-sink function depends on soil characteristics, climate and management. Emission measurements usually quantify the net result of production, consumption and transport of these gases in the soil; they do not provide information about the depth distributions of the concentrations of these gases in the soil. Here we report on concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O in air of 300 cm deep soil profiles, at resolutions of 30-50 cm, over a full year. Gas samples were taken weekly in a long-term field experiment with an irrigated winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system, and four fertilizer N application rates (0, 200, 400 and 600 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). The results showed distinct differences in CH4, CO2 and N2O concentrations profiles with soil depth. The concentrations of CO2 in soil air increased with soil depth and showed a seasonal pattern with relatively high concentrations in the warm and moist maize growing season and relatively low concentrations in the winter-wheat growing season. In contrast, CH4 concentrations decreased with depth, and did not show a distinct seasonal cycle. Urea application did not have a large effect on CH4 or CO2 concentrations, neither in the topsoil nor the subsoil. Concentrations of N2O responded to N fertilizer application and irrigation. Application of fertilizer strongly increased grain and straw yields of both winter wheat and summer maize, relatively to the control, but differences in yield between the treatments N200, N400 and N600 were not statistically significant. However, it significantly increased mean N2O concentrations peaks at basically all soil depths. Interestingly, concentrations of N2O increased almost instantaneously in the whole soil profile, which indicates that the soil had a relatively high diffusivity, despite compacted subsoil layers.
   In conclusion, the frequent measurements, at high depth resolutions, of concentrations of CH4, CO2 and N2O in soil air under a winter wheat-summer maize double crop rotation provide detailed insight into the production, consumption and transport of these gases in the soil. Concentrations of CH4, CO2 and N2O responded differently to management activities and weather conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The emission of NO was parameterized using empirical relationships with landuse type, fertilization rate and soil temperature. Eight landuse types (including four arable lands) were considered. Fertilization rates were distinguished for different regions and crops. A typical summer period of July in 1999 was chosen for detailed calculations. The total NO emission in the July is 141.1 Gg N, with 73.7% from arable lands and 22.0% from grasslands. The highest emission intensity can be more than 40 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in the heavily fertilized North China Plain, and the average of the whole lands is 6.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1). The annual emission was roughly estimated to be 657 Gg N, about 11.7% of the global total (5600 Gg N, reported by IPCC in 2000), and about 12.5% of the anthropogenic origin in China. Our results were compared with some earlier findings, and uncertainties were discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Given the common problem of fertilizer overuse, agronomists are calling for a reduction of the high nitrogen dose by 1/3. We carried out a field experiment over two full winter wheat-summer maize rotations in the North China Plain (NCP) to determine whether this degree of nitrogen reduction will significantly reduce the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Three treatments were investigated in the field trial: a control with no nitrogen application, the conventional practice with nitrogen over-application and the optimal practice with a reduced dose of nitrogen by 1/3. Our observations across all treatments over the experimental period reveal significant correlations of the fluxes of either gas with soil temperature and moisture as well as the concentrations of soil ammonium, nitrate and dissolvable organic carbon. There were strong correlations within the functions of the dual Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving apparent activation energy values of 40-97 and 59-92 kJ mol(-1) for N2O and NO fluxes, respectively. Our results provide annual direct emission factors of 0.48-0.96% for N2O and 0.15-0.47% for NO and demonstrate a significant correlation between N2O emission induced by fertilization and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The correlation indicates a significant potential of N2O mitigation via enhancing NUEs. A reduction in the nitrogen dose did not obviously mitigate either the annual NO emission in both rotations or the annual N2O emission in the second one. However, nitrogen reduction significantly decreased the annual total N2O emission by 38% during the first rotation. These inconsistencies in the responses of N2O emission to the reduced nitrogen dose can be attributed to improper fertilization practices, such as broadcasting urea prior to heavy rainfalls or irrigation events during the maize season, which implies a need for further fertilization practice options/techniques in addition to the reduction of nitrogen doses.

AB The huge excrement quantity from the increasing large-scale livestock stressed the ecological, environmental deterioration. As a major benefit for handling livestock manure, the slurry of biogas (BS) is developed during the production of biogas that might increase plant productivity. However, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from BS are considered a significant danger to the environment due to global warming potential. Furthermore, applying different proportions of BS combined with chemical fertilizer (CF) on N2O productions in the North China Plain (NCP) remains unclear. Herein, two sequential field trials were performed by maize-wheat rotations to substitute the CF by BS and reduce N2O emissions while keeping the crop yield stable. Four treatments were conducted, including T1, T3, T6, and CK. A total of 226.5 kg N ha(-1) used in the maize-wheat rotation system. Additionally, different ratios of BS (100%, 80%, and 50%) combined with CF were used in wheat season in the tillering stage. Results showed integrated applications of BS with CF have potential for reducing N2O emission. Our findings showed that the maximum grain yield of CF was 6250 kg ha(-1), which might be achieved by applying 38% BS and 62% of CF. This ratio yielded 1.03 kg ha(-1) N2O emissions, which was 15% lesser than the N2O emission of CK, 1.21 kg ha(-1). Considering whole growing period of wheat biogas treatments significantly reduced the cumulative N2O emissions from 17% to 26% compared to CF. To achieve maximum yield and minimum N2O emissions, an optimum 38% BS ratio has been suggested. The integrated use of BS and CF provided the greatest grain yield because of necessary nutrients provided by both slurry and CF. Consequently, N2O emissions reduced based on frequency and type of fertilizer. In conclusion, 38% ratio of BS combined with 62% CF would be a suitable approach to mitigate N2O emission and simultaneously increase crop yield in NCP. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Application of the inhibitor-amended nitrogen fertilizers is a recommended method for reducing agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. However, the potential impacts of these inhibitors on soil environments still needs to be evaluated using long-term experiments. Through a 6-year field observation, the effects of combined application of a nitrification inhibitor (dicyandiamide, DCD) and a urease inhibitor (hydroquinone, HQ) on N2O emission, as well as soil ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in a maize (Zea mays L.) field in Northeast China were investigated. The results showed that annual soil N2O emissions were 0.466, 1.021 and 0.874 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for N0 fertilizer treatment (CK), Urea treatment (U) and Urea + DCD + HQ treatment (UDH), respectively. A significant linear correlation was found between the N2O accumulation in the first month after fertilizer application and the short-term precipitation (i.e., a period from 10 days before to 20 days after fertilizer application). The N2O emissions in the freeze-thaw period accounted for up to 42.5% of the year-round N2O emissions. The remarkable fluctuations of annual N2O emissions were observed (their coefficients of variation were 68.3%, 77.7% and 71.2% for CK, U and UDH treatments, respectively); these fluctuations were mainly attributed to the precipitation. The averaged N2O emission factors (EF) (0.308% and 0.227% for U and UDH treatments, respectively) were far less than the default mean EF of 1% proposed by (IPCC, 2006). An averaged N2O mitigation of 26.4% was fulfilled by UDH application. The results of quantitative PCR for soil nitrification and denitrification gene copy numbers measurement showed that UDH treatment significantly decreased the ammonia oxidation bacteria (AOB) amoA gene copy numbers by 74% on the 10th day after UDH application. No significant effects of combined application of DCD and HQ on microbial denitrification functional gene abundance were observed.

AB In the North China Plain, a field experiment was conducted to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes from a typical winter wheat-summer maize rotation system under five integrated agricultural management practices: conventional regime [excessive nitrogen (N) fertilization, flood irrigation, and rotary tillage before wheat sowing; CON], recommended regime 1 (balanced N fertilization, decreased irrigation, and deep plowing before wheat sowing; REC-1), recommended regime 2 (balanced N fertilization, decreased irrigation, and no tillage; REC-2), recommended regime 3 (controlled release N fertilizer, decreased irrigation, and no tillage; REC-3), and no N fertilizer (CK). Field measurements indicated that pulse emissions after N fertilization and irrigation contributed 19-49 % of annual N2O emissions. In contrast to CON (2.21 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1)), the other treatments resulted in significant declines in cumulative N2O emissions, which ranged from 0.96 to 1.76 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1), indicating that the recommended practices (e.g., balanced N fertilization, controlled release N fertilizer, and decreased irrigation) offered substantial benefits for both sustaining grain yield and reducing N2O emissions. Emission factors of N fertilizer were 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, and 0.37 % under CON, REC-1, REC-3, and REC-2, respectively. Emissions of N2O during the freeze-thaw cycle period and the winter freezing period accounted for 9.7 and 5.1 % of the annual N2O budget, respectively. Thus, we recommend that the monitoring frequency should be increased during the freeze-thaw cycle period to obtain a proper estimate of total emissions. Annual CH4 fluxes from the soil were low (-1.54 to -1.12 kg CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1)), and N fertilizer application had no obvious effects on CH4 uptake. Values of global warming potential were predominantly determined by N2O emissions, which were 411 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) in the CK and 694-982 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) in the N fertilization regimes. When comprehensively considering grain yield, global warming potential intensity values in REC-1, REC-2, and REC-3 were significantly lower than in CON. Meanwhile, grain yield increased slightly under REC-1 and REC-3 compared to CON. Generally, REC-1 and REC-3 are recommended as promising management regimes to attain the dual objectives of sustaining grain yield and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the North China Plain.

AB The influence of inorganic fertilizer and compost on background nitrous oxide (N2O) and fertilizer-induced N2O emissions were examined over a maize-wheat rotation year from June 2008 to May 2009 in a fluvo-aquic soil in Henan Province of China where a field experiment had been established in 1989 to evaluate the long-term effects of manure and fertilizer on soil organic status. The study involved five treatments: compost (OM), fertilizer NPK (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium, NPK), half compost N plus half fertilizer N (HUM), fertilizer NK (NK), and control without any fertilizer (CK). The natural logarithms of the background N2O fluxes were significantly (P<0.05) correlated with soil temperature, but not with soil moisture, during the maize or wheat growing season. The 18-year application of compost alone and inorganic fertilizer not only significantly (P<0.05) increased soil organic carbon (SOC) by 152% and 10-43% (respectively), but also increased background N2O emissions by 106% and 48-76% (respectively) compared with the control. Total N in soils was a better indicator for predicting annual background N2O emission than SOC. The estimated emission factor (EF) of mineralized N, calculated by dividing annual N2O emission by mineralized N was 0.13-0.19%, significantly (P<0.05) lower than the EF of added N (0.30-0.39%). The annual N2O emission in the NPK, HUM and OM soils amended with 300 kg ha(-1) organic or inorganic N was 1427, 1325 and 1178 g N ha(-1), respectively. There was a significant (P<0.05) difference between the NPK and OM. The results of this study indicate that soil indigenous N was less efficiently converted into N2O compared with exogenous N. Increasing SOC by compost application, then partially increasing N supply to crops instead of adding inorganic N fertilizer, may be an effective measure to mitigate N2O emissions from arable soils in the North China plain.

AB The application of crop residues combined with Nitrogen (N) fertilizer has been broadly adopted in China. Crop residue amendments can provide readily available C and N, as well as other nutrients to agricultural soils, but also intensify the N fixation, further affecting N2O emissions. N2O pulses are obviously driven by rainfall, irrigation and fertilization. Fertilization before rainfall or followed by flooding irrigation is a general management practice for a wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain. Yet, little is known on the impacts of crop residues combined with N fertilizer application on N2O emission under high soil moisture content. A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of two crop residue amendments (maize and wheat), individually or in combination with N fertilizer, on N2O emissions and denitrifier abundance in two main agricultural soils (one is an alluvial soil, pH 8.55, belongs to Ochri-Aquic Cambosols, OAC, the other is a lime concretion black soil, pH 6.61, belongs to Hapli-Aquic Vertosols, HAV) under 80% WFPS (the water filled pore space) in the North China Plain. Each type soil contains seven treatments: a control with no N fertilizer application (CK, N0), 200 kg N ha(-1) (N200), 250 kg N ha(-1) (N250), maize residue plus N200 (MN200), maize residue plus N250 (MN250), wheat residue plus N200 (WN200) and wheat residue plus N250 (WN250). Results showed that, in the HAV soil, MN250 and WN250 increased the cumulative N2O emissions by 60% and 30% compared with N250 treatment, respectively, but MN200 and WN200 decreased the cumulative N2O emissions by 20% and 50% compared with N200. In the OAC soil, compared with N200 or N250, WN200 and WN250 increased the cumulative N2O emission by 40%-50%, but MN200 and MN250 decreased the cumulative N2O emission by 10%-20%. Compared with CK, addition of crop residue or N fertilizer resulted in significant increases in N2O emissions in both soils. The cumulative N2O emissions from the treatments of 250 kg N ha(-1) were 1.1-3.3 times higher than those of treatments with 200 kg N ha(-1) in both soils with adding equal amounts of the same type of crop residue. Abundance of the 16S rRNA gene did not significantly change in all treatments in two soils, but the nosZ and nirS genes were more abundant in soils amended with crop residues compared with CK or N-only treatments. N2O emission, however, were not related to the abundance of denitrifier containing nirS or nosZ. The research provided some information regarding the effect of crop residues with N fertilizer on N2O emissions and denitrifier abundances in two soils. Our results imply the property of crop residue and rate of N fertilizer are important influencing factors of N2O emission when crop residues combined with N fertilizer are applied to different agricultural soils.

AB Straw retention has been widely implemented to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and green-house gas (GHG) mitigation for global agriculture. However, the combined effects of long-term straw retention on crop production, SOC sequestration and GHG emissions response to climate change remain unknown. Two nearby wheat-maize rotation field experiments in the North China Plain, combined with local weather, soil and agronomic measurements, were used to evaluate the applicability of the SPACSYS model. The model was then applied to assess the response of crop yield, SOC storage and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to three nitrogen fertilizer application levels (100, 200, 400 kg N ha(-1)) and three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) under straw retention for the wheat-maize rotation systems during 2021-2100. In general, the model was reasonably accurate with R-2 and model efficiency (EF) ranging from 0.25 to 0.96 and 0.32-0.94, respectively. Climate change decreased wheat yield by 4-39%, while maize showed a slight increase (3%) under RCP2.6 and a decrease of 1-15% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The SOC storage in the 0-20 cm soil increased at a rate of 73-195 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) but decreased within the upper 1 m soil at 280-390 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Climate change reduced the positive effect of SOC sequestration except in RCP2.6 and stimulated substantial N2O emissions ranging from 1-7.5 to 2.9-23.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), consequently, the global warming potential increased from -79-2555 to 548-9357 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) under various N fertilizer application levels. This study reveals that the negative feedback under climate change with modelling approach, and extensive efforts are needed to make adaptations to ensure food production and reduce GHG emissions in the future.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and net global warming potential (GWP) are variable following crop residue retention in agroecosystems. We measured the SOC content (from 1990 to 2018) and N2O fluxes (from October 2014 to September 2018) in a long-term fertilizer experiment with winter wheat-summer maize rotation (since 1990) in the Guanzhong Plain. The primary aim was to quantify the effects of maize stalk incorporation on N2O emissions, SOC sequestration (SOCSR), and net GWP during the measurement period. We examined two fertilizer management practices, i.e., synthetic fertilizers in both crop seasons (NF) and synthetic fertilizers in both crop seasons with maize stalk incorporation in the winter wheat season (NFS), and an unfertilized control (CK). Annual N2O emissions ranged from 0.11 to 0.27 kg N ha(- 1 ) yr(-1) in CK. Fertilization significantly increased N2O emissions (p < 0.001), with values ranging from 1.65 to 5.65 and 3.08 to 7.85 kg N ha(- 1 ) yr(- 1 ) in NF and NFS, respectively. The emissions from NFS were 27-253% higher than those from NF, with significant differences (p < 0.05) during three out of four experimental years. The SOC contents linearly increased with the experimental year (p < 0.001), giving SOCSRs of 0.13, 0.45 and 0.60 t C ha(- 1 ) yr(- 1 ) in CK, NF and NFS, respectively. The net GWP averaged - 0.38, - 0.36, and 0.01 t CO2 equivalent ha(- 1 )yr(- 1 )in the three treatments, denoting that NFS was a minor greenhouse gas source during the measurement period. This study provided evidence that maize stalk incorporation increased both N2O emissions and SOC sequestration, while the N2O emissions offset the benefit of SOC sequestration. We conclude that maize stalk incorporation does not appear to be an effective approach to decrease net greenhouse gas emissions from the winter wheat-summer maize rotation in the Guanzhong Plain. This issue can probably be resolved by avoiding fertilizer application to wet soil in the winter wheat season and/or returning winter wheat straw in the summer maize season.

AB The impacts of different crop rotation systems with their corresponding management practices on grain yield, greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer nitrogen (N) and irrigation water use efficiencies are not well documented. This holds especially for the North China Plain which provides the staple food for hundreds of millions of people and where groundwater resources are polluted with nitrate and depleted through irrigation. Here, we report on fertilizer N and irrigation water use, grain yields, and nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions of conventional and optimized winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping systems, and of three alternative cropping systems, namely a winter wheat-summer maize (or soybean)-spring maize system, with three harvests in two years; and a single spring maize system with one crop per year. The results of this two-year study show that the optimized double-cropping system led to a significant increase in grain yields and a significant decrease in fertilizer N use and net greenhouse gas intensity, but the net greenhouse gas N2O emissions plus CH4 uptake and the use of irrigation water did not decrease relative to the conventional system. Compared to the conventional system the net greenhouse gas emissions, net greenhouse gas intensity and use of fertilizer N and irrigation water decreased in the three alternative cropping systems, but at the cost of grain yields except in the winter wheat-summer maize-spring maize system. Net uptake of CH4 by the soil was little affected by cropping system. Average N2O emission factors were only 0.17% for winter wheat and 0.53% for maize. In conclusion, the winter wheat-summer maize-spring maize system has considerable potential to decrease water and N use and decrease N2O emissions while maintaining high grain yields and sustainable use of groundwater.

AB Nitrous oxide is a significant greenhouse gas (GHG) contributor in crop production, yet detailed documentation, including crop yields and specific emission factors (EFd d of N2O), 2 O), are lacking for the North China Plain. A six-year (2016-2022) diversified crop rotation experiment in this region examined GHG emissions from eight crops (sweet potato, peanut, soybean, spring maize, sweet sorghum, ryegrass, summer maize, and winter wheat) and fallow seasons. The results revealed that summer maize had the highest cumulative soil N2O 2 O emissions (5.07 kg N ha- 1 ), with an average flux value of 225.3 mu g N2O-N 2 O-N m- 2 h- 1 during the growing season. Summer maize emitted 16-75 % more N2O 2 O than spring crops and winter wheat and 85-86 % more than ryegrass (cover crop) and the winter fallow season. All eight crops acted as weak net CH4 4 sinks. Annual average CO2-equivalents 2-equivalents of N2O 2 O and CH4 4 emissions reflected N2O 2 O emissions from all crops and fallow seasons. In addition, GHG footprint metrics (GFa, a , per unit area; GFy, y , per kg equivalent yield; GFb, b , per kg biomass; GFe, e , per unit economic benefit) based on life cycle assessment thinking showed that intensive cereal crops (winter wheat and summer maize) had the highest GHG footprints, while sweet potato had the lowest due to its greater biomass and lower N input. Other crops had 19-90 % lower GHG footprints than wheat and maize. Furthermore, we also quantified specific- crop EFd d of N2O, 2 O, with ryegrass having the lowest EFd d (0.48 f 0.02 %), followed by winter wheat (0.81 f 0.43 %), and other crops ranging from 1.00 f 0.13 % to 2.36 f 0.85 %. This study provides important emissions data for different crops and winter fallow periods, enhancing our understanding of GHG footprints and emission factors, which are essential for the advancement of sustainable agriculture practices.

AB A field experiment was designed to study the effects of nitrogen (N) source and urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) or nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and N use efficiency (NUE) in a sandy loam soil. Six treatments including no N fertilizer (control), N fertilizer urea alone (U), urea plus NBPT (NBPT), urea plus DCD (DCD), urea plus NBPT and DCD (NBPT plus DCD) and nitrate-based fertilizer nitrophosphate (NP) were designed and implemented separately during the wheat growth period. Seasonal cumulative N2O emissions with urea alone amounted to 0.49 +/- 0.12 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced to 0.28 +/- 0.03, 0.31 +/- 0.01 and 0.26 +/- 0.01 kg N2O-N ha(-1) by application of DCD, NBPT and NBPT plus DCD, respectively. Cumulative N2O emissions from NP were 0.28 +/- 0.01 kg N2O-N ha(-1). A single N2O flux peak was identified following basal fertilization, and DCD and/or NBPT inhibition effects mainly occurred during the peak emission period. The NP application significantly (P < 0.05) increased wheat yield by 12.3% and NUE from 28.8%(urea alone) to 35.9 %, while urease and/or nitrification inhibitors showed a slight increase effect. Our results clearly indicated that the application of urea as basal fertilizer, but not as supplemental fertilizer, together with DCD and NBPT is an effective practice to reduce N2O emissions. The application of NP instead of urea would be an optimum agricultural strategy for reducing N2O emissions and increasing crop yield and NUE for wheat cultivation in soils of the North China Plain.

AB Organic amendments are efficient measures that can be employed to increase both nitrogen use efficiency and soil organic carbon (SOC) content. However, the long-term effects of such measures on soil N2O emission and the associated underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we sampled soils that were part of two long-term trials after eight years of different amounts and types of organic amendment addition, and investigated the response of soil N2O emissions to different types of mineral N addition under oxic condition. Further, we selected two soil samples with a large difference in SOC content and investigated the responses of soil CO2, N2O, NO, and N-2 emissions as well as O-2 consumption to NH4+, NO3-, and nitrification inhibitor addition under limited O-2 diffusion condition and anoxic condition. Results showed that long-term organic amendments significantly increased SOC content, while the stimulated effect on N2O and N-2 emissions owing to increased SOC contents was more pronounced with NH4+ addition under limited O-2 diffusion condition than under oxic or anoxic conditions. Further, in all treatments under limited O-2 diffusion condition, soil O-2 concentration and N2O production showed significant inverse relationships, suggesting that O-2 directly regulates N2O production. We speculated that the decrease in O-2 availability with higher SOC contents owing to enhanced soil respiration, instead of the increased supply of electron donors, is primarily responsible for the stimulated N2O emissions. This implied that practices which reduce limited O-2 diffusion conditions might help to minimize the stimulated N2O emissions from increased SOC content. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer has long been used to help meet the increasing food demands in China, the top N fertilizer consumer in the world. Growing concerns have been raised on the impacts of N fertilizer uses on food security and climate change, which is lack of quantification. Here we use a carbon-nitrogen (C-N) coupled ecosystem model, to quantify the food benefit and climate consequence of agronomic N addition in China over the six decades from 1949 to 2008. Results show that N fertilizer-induced crop yield and soil C sequestration had reached their peaks, while nitrous oxide (N2O) emission continued rising as N was added. Since the early 2000s, stimulation of excessive N fertilizer uses to global climate warming through N2O emission was estimated to outweigh their climate benefit in increasing CO2 uptake. The net warming effect of N fertilizer uses, mainly centered in the North China Plain and the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River Basin, with N2O emission completely counteracting or even exceeding, by more than a factor of 2, the CO2 sink. If we reduced the current N fertilizer level by 60% in 'over-fertilized' areas, N2O emission would substantially decrease without significantly influencing crop yield and soil C sequestration.

TI Denitrification-Nitrate Driven N2O Uptake by Fluvisols With Low-N
   Fertiliser Is an Overlooked Sink of N2O

AB The frequent observation of negative N2O fluxes reveals a significant but overlooked soil sink, yet its potential and mechanisms under zero nitrogen (N) fertilisation remain unclear, since high-N fertiliser application induced N2O emission pulses generally obscured the role of N2O uptake. To explore the uptake potentials and driving mechanisms under zero-N fertilisation, a 3-year in situ field study (from June 2013 to May 2016) on maize-wheat rotation systems in the North China Plain was conducted, using high-resolution sampling of N2O fluxes and meteorological metadata (fluxes were every 2-3 days) and biological analysis (measured in 2015-2016). The results showed that contrasting patterns of N2O emissions between the wheat season (-492.6 g N ha-1) and maize season (443.5 g N ha-1) were recorded, and the N2O sink of the wheat season was 1.10 times that of the N2O source from the maize season during the whole experiment. Further analysis of predictor variables identified that temperature, nitrate content and nosZ abundances were the key explanatory variables for N2O uptake by wheat field soils, while denitrification, nitrate content and relatively higher abundances of AOA, AOB, NOB, nirS and/or nirK characterised maize soils. Therefore, a probable mechanism for N2O uptake by wheat field soils was that, during the wheat season, typical low temperatures extremely restricted microbial denitrification activities and decreased nitrate substrate accessibility. Moreover, higher temperature and anoxic conditions within subsurface soils provided more helpful conditions for microbial conversion of N2O to N2 with greater nosZ gene abundances. Overall, this study characterised a significantly underestimated N2O sink in the wheat season with zero-N fertilisation. These findings contribute to modifying the conventional understanding that cropland soil is always a major source of N2O emissions to the atmosphere, and also provide new insight for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation under the dual carbon strategy.

AB Background and Aim Continuous monocropping with high nitrogen (N) fertilizer input substantially increases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in maize-based agroecosystems in the North China Plain (NCP). Introducing soybeans as an intercrop with maize and partially substituting urea with manure might effectively decrease GHG emissions. The aim of this study was to quantify the synergistic effect of maize-soybean intercropping and manure on soil GHG emissions. Methods A two-year field experiment with three cropping systems (maize monocrop, soybean monocrop, and maize-soybean intercrop) and four N treatments (control, urea, manure, and manure + urea) was carried out at Luancheng Agro-Ecosystem Experimental Station in the NCP. All N treatments, except the control, received 150 kg N ha(-1)season(-1), either full dose as a basal application or two equal split applications. Results Results showed that all treatments contributed as a net source of N2O and CO2 fluxes but acted as a net sink of CH4 fluxes. In both cropping seasons, intercrops had significantly lower N2O emissions compared to monocropping systems, with 38% and 14% less emissions than maize monocrops in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, maize monocrops had significantly higher soil CO2 emissions than other systems, while maize-soybean intercropping had 12% and 13% less CO2 emissions than maize monocrops in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Among fertilized treatments, manure-treated soils emit notably lower N2O fluxes compared to sole urea treatments. In this study, N2O and CO2 fluxes had a strong positive correlation with soil mineral N concentrations, soil temperature, and moisture content. Possibly due to more efficient N utilization, intercrop soils exhibited significantly lower NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, leading to reduced nitrification and denitrification in the system, resulting in lower N2O emissions from maize-soybean intercrops. Conclusion Our findings indicate that intercropping maize and soybean reduces soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, as well as significantly decreasing soil N2O and CO2 emissions when compared to traditional maize monoculture. Therefore, due to its potential for reducing soil GHG emissions, maize-soybean intercropping can be regarded as an effective alternative cropping system to the prevailing maize-dominant monoculture to develop a sustainable agroecosystem in the NCP region.

AB The linkage between N2O emissions and the abundance of nitrifier and denitrifier genes is unclear in the intensively managed calcareous fluvo-aquic soils of the North China Plain. We investigated the abundance of bacterial amoA for nitrification and narG, nirS, nirK, and nosZ for denitrification by in situ soil sampling to determine how the abundance of these genes changes instantly during N fertilization events and is related to high N2O emission peaks. We also investigated how long-term incorporated straw and/or manure affect(s) the abundance of these genes based on a seven-year field experiment. The overall results demonstrate that the long-term application of urea-based fertilizer and/or manure significantly enhanced the number of bacterial amoA gene copies leading to high N2O emission peaks after N fertilizer applications. These peaks contributed greatly to the annual N2O emissions in the crop rotation. A significant correlation between annual N2O emissions and narG, nirS, and nirK gene numbers indicates that the abundance of these genes is related to N2O emission under conditions for denitrification, thus partly contributing to the annual N2O emissions. These findings will help to draw up appropriate measures for mitigation of N2O emissions in this `hotspot' region.

AB Compost and biogas slurry are increasingly used as organic fertilisers, but existing studies on their application on soil N2O emissions have been contradictory, studies on soil N2 emissions are lacking, and the mechanism of microbial control of gaseous N loss is unclear. This study investigated the effects of partially replacing mineral fertilisers with compost (30%) and biogas slurry (50%) on CO2, N2O, and N2 emissions, alongside soil nitrogen-cycling microbial communities in no nitrogen application (LN) and 600 kg N ha-1 year-1 fertilisation (HN) soils from China's North China Plain. Through controlled incubation experiments, gas flux measurements, and metagenomic analysis, we found that in the first 5 days of fertilised treatments, N2O emissions accounted for 85.26% and 94.18%, while N2 emissions accounted for 71.25% and 68.78% of total emissions under LN and HN, respectively. Organic substitutions reduced soil mineral nitrogen (-N) content by limiting exogenous nitrogen input and suppressing native organic matter mineralisation, thereby decreasing pulse emissions of N2O, N2, and CO2. While both substitutions promoted complete denitrification, biogas slurry at 50% substitution significantly enhanced nitrifying microbe abundance (Nitrosospira, Nitrospira) and nitrification-related functional genes (AmoC and Hao), increasing nitrification-driven N2O emissions compared to compost. For sustainable management, high-fertility soils benefit from partial substitution of mineral fertiliser with compost, whereas low-fertility soils require substitution ratios of biogas slurry for mineral fertiliser to boost microbial activity. These findings provide critical insights for optimising organic substitution strategies to balance productivity and environmental sustainability in intensive agricultural systems.

AB Agricultural production plays an important role in affecting atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Field measurements were conducted in Quzhou County, Hebei Province in the North China Plains to quantify carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a winter wheat-maize rotation field, a common cropping system across the Chinese agricultural regions. The observed flux data in conj. unction with the local climate, soil and management information were utilized to test a process-based model, Denitrification-Decomposition or DNDC, for its applicability for the cropping system. The validated DNDC was then used for predicting impacts of three management alternatives (i.e., no-till, increased crop residue incorporation and reduced fertilizer application rate) on CO2 and N2O emissions from the target field. Results from the simulations indicated that (1) CO2 emissions were significantly affected by temperature, initial SOC, tillage method, and quantity and quality of the organic matter added in the soils; (2) increases in temperature, initial SOC, total fertilizer N input, and manure amendment substantially increased N2O emissions; and (3) temperature, initial SOC, tillage, and quantity and quality of the organic matter added in the soil all had significant effects on global warming. Finally, five 50-year scenarios were simulated with DNDC to predict their long-term impacts on crop yield, soil C dynamics, nitrate leaching losses, and N2O emissions. The modelled results suggested that implementation of manure amendment or crop residue incorporation instead of increased fertilizer application rates would more efficiently mitigate GHG emissions from the tested agro-ecosystem. The multi-impacts provided a Sound basis for comprehensive assessments on the management alternatives. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The exchange fluxes of NOx, NH3 and N2O between two typical agricultural fields and the atmosphere were investigated in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and North China Plain (NCP). The average fluxes of NO and NH3 from the wheat field in the YRD were 79 and -5.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1), and from the paddy field were 3.7 and 34.8 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The fertilize-induced emission factors (EFs) as NO-N and NH3-N from the wheat field were 2.3% and 1%, and from the paddy field were 0.09% and 3.5%, respectively. Remarkable yearly variation of N2O emissions from the investigated NCP maize field was observed, with average fluxes of 72.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in 2008 and 30 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in 2009 and with EFs of 3.78% in 2008 and 1.08% in 2009. The average NO and NH3 fluxes from the maize field in 2009 were 36.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and 94.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Based on the molar ratios of NO/N2O, the emissions of NOx and N2O from the maize field were mainly ascribed to nitrification processes. Returning wheat straw back into the maize field could significantly reduce NOx and NH3 emissions.

AB This research investigated the N2O fluxes and community compositions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system on the North China Plain. The experiment included three treatments: 1) a control treatment (CK); 2) biochar at 10.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (C); and 3) organic fertilizer at 7.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (M). The application of biochar reduced the cumulative N2O emissions by 47.7% and 62.2% in the maize and wheat seasons, respectively, compared with those of the CK treatment. Organic fertilizer increased the cumulative N2O emissions by 311.1% in the maize season and had no significant effects on them in the wheat season. Organic fertilizer reduced the cumulative N2O emissions by 39.8% in the nonfertilizer period of the maize season. The cumulative N2O emissions in the maize season accounted for 75.2-90.0% of the annual emissions among all the treatments. Biochar and organic fertilizer affected soil N2O emissions mainly by changing soil denitrifiers. In the maize season, the lower abundances of Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum (AOA-amoA), Nitrosomonas (AOB-amoA), Mesorhizobium (nirK), Magnetospirillum (nirS) and Halomonas (nirS) may result in lower N2O emissions in the biochar treatment, and organic fertilizer had a similar influencing mechanism on N2O emissions during the nonbasic fertilizer and nontopdressing periods of the maize season. In the wheat season, the dominant genus Alicycliphilus (nosZ) was the major contributor to decreasing N2O emissions in the biochar treatment, while there was no biomarker related to N2O emissions in the M treatment. The soil pH, NO3--N content and water-filled pore space (WFPS) were the key factors shifting the community compositions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in this study. The application of biochar could be a better practice to improve saline-alkali soil with lower N2O emissions. These findings will improve our understanding of the nitrifiers and denitrifiers response to biochar and organic fertilizer.

AB Soils act as sources and sinks for greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Since both storage and emission capacities may be large, precise quantifications are needed to obtain reliable global budgets that are necessary for land-use management (agriculture, forestry), global change and for climate research. This paper discusses exclusively the soil emission related processes and their influencing parameters. It reviews soil emission studies involving the most important land-cover types and climate zones and introduces important measuring systems for soil emissions. It addresses current shortcomings and the obvious bias towards northern hemispheric data.
   When using a conservative average of 300 mg CO(2)e m(-2) h(-1) (based on our literature review), this leads to global annual net soil emissions of >= 350 Pg CO(2)e (CO(2)e = CO2 equivalents = total effect of all GHG normalized to CO2). This corresponds to roughly 21% of the global soil C and N pools. For comparison, 33.4 Pg CO2 are being emitted annually by fossil fuel combustion and the cement industry. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB To investigate the effects of maize/legume intercropping on soil N2O emissions, six treatments were tested in the North China Plain: maize, M120 (N application rate 120 kg ha-1); maize, M240 (N application rate 240 kg ha-1); soybean (Glycine max), SS (120 kg ha-1); maize/soybean intercropping, MS (120 kg ha-1); peanut (Arachis hypogaea), PP (120 kg ha-1); and maize/peanut intercropping, MP (120 kg ha-1). The amounts of inorganic nitrogen for the 0-20 cm soil in MS were 24.0%, 5.3%, and 29.3% lower than in SS, M120, and M240, respectively (P < 0.05). The total N2O emissions ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.09 to 0.98 +/- 0.14 kg ha-1. MP and MS were statistically different at the 95% confidence level, whereas MP produced the least N2O emissions at 0.41 kg ha-1. The seasonal cumulative N2O emissions and global warming potential in MS and MP were also significantly lower than those in the other three monoculture treatments (P < 0.001). The results demonstrated that maize/legume intercropping can increase the N uptake of crops and reduce the amount of soil inorganic nitrogen and N2O emissions, thereby, ensuring the sustainability of the agricultural environment.

AB Determining the features of soil CO2 and N2O emissions and the driving factors of deficit irrigation is of great significance for optimizing cropland management modes. In this study, the experimental plots were selected in a typical area of the North China Plain during the whole growth period of winter wheat. Six irrigation levels were designed to investigate the effect of deficit irrigation on CO2 and N2O emissions and wheat yield. CK represents reference irrigation (full-water irrigation), and T1-T5 represent irrigation water decreasing by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%, respectively. The experiment showed that soil CO2 and N2O emissions decreased under the deficit irrigation treatments (T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5). Pearson correlation analysis showed that there were significant correlations between the CO2 emissions and soil temperature or water-filled pore space (WFPS) under the different irrigation treatments, and these correlations had a significant linear relationship. However, there was no discernible correlation between the N2O emissions and soil temperature or WFPS under the other irrigation treatments except the CK treatment. Compared with that of the CK treatment, the equivalent CO2 of the T1-T5 treatments decreased by 8.6%, 5.7%, 14.3%, 14.1% and 19.3%, respectively. Compared with the CK treatment, the T3-T5 treatments significantly decreased the N2O emissions (P < 0.05), and the reduction in CO2 by deficit irrigation did not reach a significant level (P > 0.05). Moreover, some deficit irrigation treatments had negative influences on the yield of winter wheat. Through the TOPSIS method and RSR method, the effects of the irrigation levels on equivalent CO2 and wheat yield were evaluated comprehensively. The T3 treatment was shown to be the best irrigation level for the conservation of wheat yield and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the corresponding irrigation water amount under the T3 treatment could be regarded as the most appropriate scheme. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reactive nitrogen gas (Nr) originating from the soil is highly susceptible to the influence of agricultural water and fertilizer management practices, making it a critical gas that can substantially contribute to atmospheric pollution. Understanding the emission patterns of Nr in the surface soil under reclaimed water (RW) irrigation is essential for guiding RW irrigation practices and informing policies aimed at reducing Nr emissions. In this study conducted in Beijing, North China, field sites were selected with different irrigation management strategies and corresponding fertilizer application methods. The two types of irrigation water quality comprised RW irrigation and groundwater (UW) irrigation, whereas the two fertilizer types utilized were calcium ammonium nitrate with a high nitrate nitrogen content and ammonium sulfate with ammonium nitrogen. Nr emissions and concentrations in the soil profile (0-30 cm depth) were monitored throughout key agricultural events, including cultivation, irrigation, fertilization, and harvest, spanning the period from 2020 to 2021. It is observed that RW irrigation effectively reduces cumulative ammonia (NH3) emissions compared to groundwater (UW) treatment. However, it results in increased concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) (12.33%-73.82%) and nitric oxide (NO) (13.74%-36.59%) in the soil within the depth range of 0-30 cm. Of particular importance is the notable increase in the abundance of soil denitrifying and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA-amoA) genes due to RW irrigation, indicating the potential for elevated N2O and NO emissions. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the soil Nr emissions and concentrations are more strongly affected by nitrogen type rather than water quality. Conversely, the inclusion of nitrate has proven to be effective in mitigating N2O and NO emissions in RW-irrigated farmland.

AB Although nitrogen fertilizer is crucially important for China's crop production, the overuses in the intensive cereal cropping systems of the North China Plain has caused extensive concern for its environmental consequences on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes. To characterize the integration of environmental and agronomic aspects of fertilizer management, we conducted two annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summer maize (Zea mays L.) rotation cycles under five fertilization treatments, including the farmers' conventional practice (CP) amended with synthetic nitrogen, three alternative managements of reduced nitrogen inputs with synthetic fertilizers alone (UA), synthetic fertilizers combined with poultry manure (UA + PM) or controlled-release urea combined with poultry manure (CU + PM), and the control without nitrogen fertilization (CK). The N2O and NO fluxes and direct emission factors varied seasonally and annually. These variations could be interpreted mechanically by a revised "hole-in-the-pipe" model and dual Michaelis-Menten and Arrhenius kinetics. The CM, CP, UA, UA + PM, and CU + PM treatments released N2O at 0.65, 4.64, 3.66, 2.88, and 2.40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, and NO at least 0.42, 2.35, 2.24, 1.30, and 1.18 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The annual direct emission factors of N2O and NO were 0.41-0.67% and 0.18-0.32%, respectively. The three alternative managements decreased both N2O and NO emissions, expressed either on an area basis or relative to grain yield, without sacrificing crop yields compared to CP. However, their mitigation effects on each gas emission were different. The UA treatment reduced only N2O emission, while UA + PM and CU + PM showed significant mitigation effects on both gases as compared to CP or UA. Overall, our results provide insight into environmental aspect of fertilizer management in major cereal crops and suggest that reducing nitrogen input coupled with organic manure incorporation could be beneficial for simultaneously mitigating nitrogen-containing trace gas fluxes and sustaining cereal grain yields.

AB [1] Soil denitrification fluxes and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the soil surface simulated by a Water and Nitrogen Management Model (WNMM), with three different gas modules, are compared to measurement data sets from two irrigated wheat-maize systems at two locations in the North China Plain (NCP) ( 2 years of measurement at the Luancheng site and 1 year of measurement at the Fengqiu site). The three gas modules are the WNMM gas module, the DAYCENT gas module, and the DNDC gas module. The term gas module used in this paper refers to the model component which simulates N2O emission from the processes of soil nitrification and denitrification. Soil water, temperature, organic matter decomposition, other nitrogen (N) transformations, such as mineralization and immobilization, and crop growth are simulated by the WNMM platform. For the 2-year data set from Luancheng, the three gas modules generate similar soil mineral N dynamics in the 0 - 20 cm topsoil. The daily time step, simply structured WNMM gas module consistently performs the best among the three gas modules for predicting soil denitrification fluxes (R-2 = 0.28, n = 39, p = 0.0006) and N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.45, n = 36, p < 0.0001). Up to 73, 43, and 22% of total N2O emissions are nitrification-induced as simulated by the DNDC, DAYCENT, and WNMM gas modules respectively, in this well-drained loam soil during the 2-year simulation. When applied to the 1-year data set at the Fengqiu site, the WNMM gas module consistently performs better in estimating N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.54, n = 35, p < 0.0001) compared to the other two modules. Simulations using the DNDC and DAYCENT gas modules explain over 40% of the temporal variation of N2O emission from the soil. Further testing on different soils and different agroecosystems is needed to confirm the superior performance of the WNMM gas module observed in this simulation study.

AB Diverse crop rotations are increasingly recognized as key to address the global food crisis and improve environmental sustainability, including reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the specific effects on N2O emissions of different crops in these rotations and the underlying incidence on microbial processes remain underexplored. In a six-year field study, we compared N2O emissions from traditional wheat-maize rotation with diverse rotations, including legumes (peanut, soybean), ryegrass, sorghum, and sweet potato. We also examined the microbial functions associated with nitrogen cycling based on functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa (FAPROTAX) analysis. Our study showed that diversified crop rotations with reduced synthetic fertilization and irrigation can reduce N2O emissions by 23 %-49 % compared to conventional rotations. These reductions were supported by increases in soil organic carbon, soil carbon/nitrogen ratio and decreases in the relative abundance of denitrifying microorganisms, particularly observed in rotations with soybean and sweet potato. However, the spring maize and peanut-based rotation had higher emission factors than traditional wheat-maize rotation due to lower initial crop nitrogen uptake and lower nitrogen use efficiency, respectively. Changes in the microbial community structures of nitrification and denitrification processes, including increased activity of ammoniaoxidizing bacteria MND1 and archaea Candidatus Nitrososphaera in legume and sweet potato rotations, and a shift in denitrifying microbes of diverse rotations (a decrease in Rhodoplanes and an increase in Paracoccus), significantly contributed to the overall reductions in emissions in all other investigated rotation systems. Understanding the microbial mechanisms that control N2O emissions from agricultural soils will enable the development of more effective and crop-specific strategies to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

AB N2O emissions from a maize-wheat rotation field were monitored in the Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station (Fenaqiu County, Henan Province, China) from June 2004 to June 2005. The experiment included four treatments: a bare (crop-absent) soil treated with 150 kg N ha(-1) (WN150) and soils fertilized with 0 (N0), 150 (N 150), and 250 (N250) kg N ha(-1) and cropped with maize or wheat. The bulk of the N2O emissions occurred in pulses following the application of fertilizer N at soil temperatures of 15 degrees C or more. The application of fertilizer N significantly increased the N2O emission, from 636 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the N0 treatment to 4480 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the N250 treatment. However, this increase primarily occurred during the maize growing season. The emission factor of applied fertilizer N as N2O was 1.05-1.34% and 0.24-0.26% during the 105-day maize and 241-day wheat growing seasons, respectively, and was on average 0.61-0.77%. Increasing the rate of fertilizer application increased the emission factor during the maize growing season. The presence of maize appears to increase N2O emission by 45% versus bare soil during the maize growing season. And, N2O emission during the maize season were significantly related to CO, production (R=0.43-0.81, n=30, P < 0.05). N2O emission was greatly affected by soil moisture during the maize growing season and by soil temperature during the wheat growing season. The maximum rates of nitrification occurred when soil moisture was in the range of 45-60% WFPS, with the optimum value being approximately 50%. However, soil moisture influenced N2O emission only when the soil temperature was at the optimum level. It is suggested that reducing the application rate of basal fertilizer N during the maize growing season could decrease N2O emission. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biochar application has been reported to effectively mitigate N2O emissions and increase crop yield; however, its long-term residual effects remain largely unknown. A four-year field experiment was designed in the North China Plain (NCP) to evaluate the residual effect of biochar on N2O and NO emissions and crop yield under maize-wheat rotation. The study included five treatments: no N fertilization (Control), N fertilizer application (CN), and N fertilizer plus maize-straw biochar application at 3 (NB3), 6 (NB6) and 12 t ha(-1) (NB12). Biochar amendment had no effect on maize yield during the four-year rotation, but increased maize grain N uptake by 12.9 - 14.1 % and fertilizer N use efficiency by 13.8 % in the fourth year. Meanwhile, NB12 treatment decreased wheat yield by 11.7 - 15.5 % in each year, except the second, while decreased average wheat yield. Biochar application significantly reduced N2O emissions by 31.5 - 42.4 % during the first maize season, and by 6.9 - 21.3 % in the third and fourth years primarily due to reduction in NH4+ availability for nitrification. Furthermore, this mitigation effect was positively related to soil moisture content and decreased with time after biochar application. Cumulative N2O emissions during the four wheat seasons were 0.25 - 0.85 kg N2O-N ha(-1), and only decreased by 8.9 - 9.9 % under biochar amendment in the third and fourth years probably because low soil temperature suppressed N2O production. Biochar addition in the third and fourth years significantly reduced NO emissions by 9.0 - 20.1 % during the maize growing seasons and 10.5 - 19.1 % during the wheat growing seasons, especially under NB6 treatment. The average yield-scaled N2O and NO emissions were lowest in the NB6 treatment during the maize and wheat season. Overall, these findings suggest that 6 t ha(-1) is the optimal biochar application rate for reducing N2O/NO emissions and yield-scaled N2O/NO emission under four-year maize-wheat rotation in the NCP.

AB Lowland rice production is currently facing serious water shortages in numerous Asian countries. In the North China Plain water limitations are severe. Water-saving rice production techniques are therefore increasingly searched for. Here we present the first study of trace gas emissions from a water-saving rice production system where soils are mulched and are kept close to field capacity in order to compare their contribution to global warming with traditional paddy rice. In a two-year field experiment close to Beijing, CH4 and N2O fluxes were monitored in two forms of the Ground Cover Rice Production System (GCRPS) and in traditional paddy fields using closed chambers. With paddy rice the observed CH4 emissions were very low, about 0.3 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1) in 2001 and about 1 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1) in 2002. In GCRPS, the CH4 emissions were negligible. N2O fluxes in GCRPS were similar, 0.5 to 0.6 g N2O m(-2) a(-1) in 2001 and 2002, and emission peaks mainly followed fertilizer applications. In paddy rice, N2O fluxes were unexpectedly low throughout the year 2001 (0.03 g N2O m(-2) a(-1)), and in 2002 larger emissions occurred during the drainage period. So with 0.4 g N2O m(-2) a(-1) the cumulative flux was similar to emissions in GCRPS. Total CO2 equivalent fluxes calculated according to IPCC methodology were tenfold higher in GCRPS compared to paddy in 2001. In 2002, fluxes from both systems were similar with 175 and 141 g CO2 equivalents m(-2) a(-1) from GCRPS and paddy.

AB The one-time application of common urea blended with controlled-release urea (CRU) is considered effective for improving nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of summer maize in intensive agricultural systems. However, the trade-off between the economic and environmental performances of different blended fertilizer treatments for different maize varieties remains unclear. Therefore, a consecutive two-year field experiment was conducted in the North China Plain to study the effects of different ratios of CRU and common urea on the yield, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, yield-scaled total N2O emissions, greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), and net ecosystem economic benefit (NEEB) in 2021 and 2022. Four N fertilizer treatments with equal rate at 180 kg N ha(-1) were applied as N180U (all Urea), N180C1(1/3CRU), N180C2(2/3CRU), and N180C (all CRU), and two maize varieties (JNK728-yellow ripe variety and ZD958-green ripe variety) were used. The N180C1 and N180C2 treatments produced the highest grain yield in varieties JNK728 and ZD958 (9.4-11.5 t ha(-1) and 9.0-11.0 t ha(-1)), respectively. Compared to the N180U treatment (conventional method), the N180C1 treatment reduced the GHGI (24.8 %-25.9 %) and increased the NEEB (33.1 %-33.4 %) in the JNK728 variety, whereas the N180C2 treatment reduced the GHGI (16.9 %-28.8 %) and increased the NEEB (27.2 %-48.1 %) in the ZD958 variety. The study concludes that a one-time application of blended nitrogen fertilizer in suitable varieties can minimize the GHGI and maximize the NEEB, which is an effective strategy for balancing yield and nitrogen efficiency in the summer maize system in the North China Plain.

AB Biochar application is thought to improve crop yield and reduce N leaching and gas emissions; however, little is known about how field-aged biochar affects fertilizer N retention and N2O emissions. Here, a field microplot experiment is established in the North China Plain at maize season by applying N-15-labeled urea to the sandy loam soil both with (Biochar) and without (Control) application of 3-year field-aged biochar at 12 t ha(-1). Overall, 25.6-26.2% of the urea N was taken up by maize aboveground biomass, field-aged biochar did not affect yield or fertilizer N recovery efficiency. After maize harvest, the residual ratio of applied N in the soil profile (0-40 cm) was 21.6 and 20.3% under Control and Biochar treatment, respectively, with an increase of 10.2% in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and decrease of 37.2% in the subsoil (20-40 cm) following biochar amendment, probably due to reduced NO3- leaching. Cumulative N2O emissions and urea N-induced N2O emissions under Control treatment were 2.06 and 0.78 kg N ha(-1), and significantly decreased to 1.89 and 0.74 kg N ha(-1) after Biochar treatment, respectively. N2O emissions derived from the applied N accounted for 38.0 and 39.4% of the total emissions under Control and Biochar treatment, respectively. N2O emissions from decomposition of soil organic N induced by the priming effect of the applied N was 0.69 and 0.56 kg N ha(-1) under Control and Biochar treatment, respectively, contributing 33.7 and 29.7% of the total emissions. Overall, our results suggest that field-aged biochar increased the retention of fertilizerNin the topsoil by reducing NO3 leaching, while effectively reduced N2O emissions from fertilizer N and mineralization of organic N in the sandy loam soil.

AB The N losses via denitrification and the N-2/N2O emission ratio are highly uncertain, mainly due to methodological difficulties concerning measurement of N-2 emissions. Here, we report on seasonal measurements of N2O and N-2 emissions from the top soil of a winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping system in the North China Plain. A novel double cylinder soil core method was used to measure N2O and N-2 fluxes in situ from a 20-year field experiment with four N fertilizer treatments (0, 200, 400, and 600kgNha(-1)year(-1)) and 16 sampling occasions over a 1-year period. The N-2-free helium-oxygen atmosphere in the inter-layer between the two cylinders acted as a buffer against N-2 diffusion from the atmosphere into the soil core. Total N2O emissions were 0.44, 1.31, 2.19, and 2.23kgNha(-1)year(-1), and total N-2 emissions were 8.3, 20.0, 22.5, and 24.7kgNha(-1)year(-1) from the N0, N200, N400, and N600 treatments, respectively. The N-2/N2O emission ratio ranged from 2 to 136, indicating that N-2 was the dominant gas. The N-2/N2O ratio was much higher in summer than in winter, and was inversely related to fertilizer N application. Fluxes of N-2 were statistically related to soil temperature and concentrations of NO3--N and DOC in soil extracts, while N2O fluxes were related to soil water content and concentrations of NO3--N and exchangeable NH4+ in soil extracts. The N-2/N2O ratio was related to soil temperature and exchangeable NH4+ and NO3--N concentrations. Our study provides new insights on variations of the N-2/N2O emission ratio in agroecosystems, and shows the importance of seasonal measurements.

AB Gaseous reactive nitrogen (GNr) losses (N2O, NO emissions and NH3 volatilization, etc.) in greenhouse vegetable fields (GVF) have received considerable critical attention. Much uncertainty still exists about GNr losses reduction under increasing vegetables demand and environmental policies in China. An experiment spanning four greenhouse vegetable growing seasons (cucumber and tomato) was conducted in North China Plain (NCP). It included four treatments, i.e., flood irrigation with no urea-N application (FU0), flood irrigation with conventional urea-N application (FUN), drip fertigation with conventional urea-N application (DUN), and drip fertigation with 50% reduction of urea-N application (DRUN). Obvious emission peaks of N2O, NO and NH3 flux were captured in the GVF after each fertilization and irrigation event. For FUN treatment, the mean annual area-scaled emissions of N2O, NO, and NH3 were 11.48, 1.66, and 44.90 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively; and the mean annual yield-scaled emissions of N2O, NO, and NH3 were 181.86, 23.04, and 800.07 g N t-1 yr- 1, respectively. On the mean annual area-scaled and yield-scaled, the N2O emissions were significantly (P < 0.05) lower by 40.1 % and 32.3 %, and the NO emissions were lower by 23.5 % and 28.5 %, but the NH3 volatilization were significantly (P < 0.05) higher by 31.7 % and 49.0 %, respectively, for the DUN treatment than FUN. Also compared with FUN, in DRUN treatment, the mean annual area-scaled N2O emissions, NO emissions and NH3 volatilization were significantly reduced by 46.7 %, 52.4 % and 22.0 %, respectively; and the mean annual yield-scaled N2O emissions, NO emissions and NH3 volatilization were significantly reduced by 40.7 %, 57.1 % and 24.5 %, respectively. Moreover, compared with FUN treatment, DUN and DRUN treatment both alleviated the global temperature potential (GTP) at 20- and 100-year timescales. Overall, compared with conventional water and fertilizer regimes, only changing irrigation mode reduced N2O and NO emissions but increased NH3 volatilization losses in greenhouse cucumber-tomato cultivation system; reducing N application while changing irrigation methods had significant emission reduction effects on N2O, NO and NH3 at both the area-scaled and yield-scaled, and which is an effective water and fertilizer managements for greenhouse cucumber-tomato cultivation system.

AB Vegetation loss and plant diversity decline in wetlands affect carbon and nitrogen cycling and consequently influence gas fluxes. Although extensive grazing by livestock and climate change have caused significant physical degradation of wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), and created a clear drainage gradient, the impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with this change has rarely been reported. A 3-year study (2013-2015) was conducted to examine the effect of vegetation change and seasonality on ecosystem respiration, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in four classes of wetlands with distinct magnitudes of vegetation degradation: healthy vegetation (HV), slightly degraded (SD), moderately degraded, and heavily degraded (HD). We used the dark static chamber-chromatography method to measure the gas fluxes. Highly degraded wetlands were larger C and GHG sources than HV, despite lower methane emissions, due to the loss of gross primary production. SD and HD exhibited the highest cumulative mean annual ecosystem respiration and N2O emissions, respectively. Ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes were much higher during the growing seasons than in the non-growing seasons. Ecosystem respiration and N2O fluxes were positively correlated with soil and air temperatures. This points at a potential effect of global warming on GHG emissions from the QTP wetlands. Top soil (0-20cm) moisture content significantly correlated positively with CH4 fluxes. Vegetation loss led to a reduced C uptake and increased global warming potential. Therefore, we recommend soil conservation measures and reduced livestock grazing in the wetlands in order to conserve their role as carbon sinks.

AB Introduction: Agricultural organic waste recycling can supply nutrients for crop production and partially replace chemical nitrogen fertilizers, which is beneficial for waste management and environmental protection. Nevertheless, comprehensive evaluation of the effects of different organic materials applications on crop yield and the environment is limited. Methods: Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive investigation of the synergistic effects of straw, pig manure, and biogas residue recycling on the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) systems was carried out in the North China Plain. Field experiments were conducted from 2019 to 2021, comprising five treatments: straw (ST), pig manure (PM), and biogas residue (BR) partially replacing chemical nitrogen fertilizer, sole application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer (CF), and a control with no nitrogen application (WN). Results and discussion: The results showed that organic materials significantly increased soil total nitrogen (3.04%-9.10%) and N recovery efficiency (REN; 42.21%-44.99%), but pig manure was more beneficial in increasing crop yields (3.50%), especially wheat yields (8.72%), and REN was significantly higher than that of the other treatments. Organic materials performed differently in wheat and maize seasons, and wheat yield could be improved by organic materials return. Organic materials stimulated N2O emission in wheat season (4.28%-32.20%), while biogas residue inhibited the N2O emission in maize season (47.47%). The negative effect of straw and biogas residue on yield decreased with increasing years of return, and pig manure continued to contribute to yield. In conclusion, pig manure is the optimal alternative that can increase crop yield, soil N content, and REN without stimulating N2O emissions.

AB The appropriate nitrogen (N) fertilizer regulator could increase N utilization of crops and reduce N losses in the North China Plain. We investigated the effects of reduced inorganic-N rate combined with an organic fertilizer on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in winter wheat and summer maize rotation system. Simultaneously studied the effect of different treatments on N use efficiency (NUE), N balance and net income. After reducing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the wheat-corn rotation system, the results showed that the cumulative emission of soil N2O from the RN40%+HOM [40% of RN (recommended inorganic-N rate) with homemade organic matter] treatment was 41.0% lower than that of the RN treatment. In addition, the N production efficiency, agronomic efficiency, and apparent utilization were significantly increased by 50.2%, 72.4% and 19.5% than RN, respectively. The use of RN40%+HOM resulted in 22.0 and 30.1% lower soil N residual and N losses as compared with RN. After adding organic substances, soil N2O cumulative emission of RN40%+HOM treatment decreased by 20.9% than that of the HAN (zinc and humic acid urea at the same inorganic-N rate of RN) treatment. The N production efficiency, N agronomic efficiency and NUE of RN40%+HOM treatment were 36.6%, 40.9% and 15.3% higher than HAN's. Moreover, soil residual and apparent loss N were 23.3% and 18.0% less than HAN's. The RN40%+HOM treatment appears to be the most effective as a fertilizer control method where it reduced N fertilizer input and its loss to the environment and provided the highest grain yield.

AB A better understanding of the internal N cycle in agriculturally used soils is crucial for developing sustainable and environmentally friendly N fertilizer management and to propose effective N2O mitigation strategies. The present laboratory study quantifies gross nitrogen transformations in an intensively used agricultural soil of the North China Plain (NCP). It also elucidates the role of nitrification and denitrification in the emissions of the greenhouse gas N2O. In the lab, soil samples adjusted to a water-filled pore space (WFPS) of 40 or 60% were spiked with (NH4NO3)-N-15, (NH4NO3)-N-15, or (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 and incubated at 20 degrees C for 10 d. One subset of the samples was amended with glucose. The size and N-15 enrichment of the mineral N pools and N2O fluxes were determined at intervals of 0 to 10 d. The studied calcareous soil showed a very rapid nitrification of the applied NH4+, which disappeared during the first 3 d. Glucose enhanced mineralization of native soil organic matter (SOM), stimulated dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and promoted the immobilization-remineralization cycle. Throughout the incubation, nitrification, and denitrification Occurred simultaneously. Nitrification was the dominant N2O-producing process and contributed 83.0 to 95.4% to the totally emitted N2O in the non-glucose soils. In contrast, the N2O emitted from (NO3-)-N-15 pool increased after adding glucose, indicating that denitrification was C-limited in the studied soil.

AB To understand the effects of long-term amendment of organic manure and N fertilizer on N2O emission in the North China Plain, a laboratory incubation at different temperatures and soil moistures were carried out using soils treated with organic manure (OM), half organic manure plus half fertilizer N (HOM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NP (NP), fertilizer NK (NK), fertilizer PK (NK) and control (CK) since 1989. Cumulative N2O emission in OM soil during the 17 d incubation period was slightly higher than in NPK soil under optimum nitrification conditions (25 degrees C and 60% water-filled pore space, WFPS), but more than twice under the optimum denitrification conditions (35 degrees C and 90% WFPS). N2O produced by denitrification was 2.1-2.3 times greater than that by nitrification in OM and HOM soils, but only 1.5 times greater in NPK and NP soils. These results implied that the long-term amendment of organic manure could significantly increase the N2O emission via denitrification in OM soil as compared to NPK soil. This is quite different from field measurement between OM soil and NPK soil. Substantial inhibition of the formation of anaerobic environment for denitrification in field might result in no marked difference in N2O emission between OM and NPK soils. This is due in part to more rapid oxygen diffusion in coarse textured soils than consumption by aerobic microbes until WFPS was 75% and to low easily decomposed organic C of organic manure. This finding suggested that addition of organic manure in the tested sandy loam might be a good management option since it seldom caused a burst of N2O emission but sequestered atmospheric C and maintained efficiently applied N in soil.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured over a 3-year period (2004-2007) in a long-term experimental field. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the interannual variation of N2O emissions from a maize-wheat rotation, under different fertilizer regimes and to determine the key controlling factors. The study involved four treatments: compost (OM), half compost N plus half inorganic fertilizer-N (HOM), inorganic fertilizer-N (NPK), and control (CK) where no N application. The mean annual N2O emission over a 3-year period was 030 +/- 0.11 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the CK treatment, but increased to 1.61 +/- 0.10 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the HOM treatment, 2.13 +/- 0.15 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the OM treatment, and 2.76 +/- 0.19 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the NPK treatment. Differences were significant among treatments. The N2O emission factors of the applied OM, NPK and HUM were 0.61 +/- 0.02, 0.82 +/- 0.10 and 0.44 +/- 0.04%, respectively, at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), indicating that the combined application of compost with inorganic fertilizer significantly reduced N2O emission. Over a maize-wheat rotation year, more than 65% of the annual N2O emission occurred during the maize growing season. There was a large interannual variation in N2O emission in all treatments, albeit not significant either during the maize growing season or at an inter-year scale. This interannual variation was mainly attributable to differences in soil moisture after basal fertilizer application, and irrigation and/or heavy rainfall events immediately following basal fertilization could induce more N2O production than pre-irrigation before plowing. The HOM treatment had higher N fertilizer use efficiency and lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions compared with the OM and NPK treatments. We therefore argue that the combined application of half compost N plus half fertilizer-N will mitigate N2O emissions from soils in the North China plain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The agricultural practice of straw incorporation is often employed to enhance soil fertility, improve soil properties and reduce nitrate leaching via deep burying. Nevertheless, the tradeoff between nitrate leaching and N2O emissions caused by deep straw incorporation in various soil types remains uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, a mesocosm column experiment was established to evaluate the impact of straw amendment (NS) and of straw plus application of denitrifying bacterial agents (NSS) at column depths of 20-60 cm on NO3--N leaching and N2O emission across four soil types (brown, cinnamon, fluvo-aquic and mortar black soil) in the North China plain. The results showed that the NS and NSS treatments significantly reduced NO3--N leaching by 47%-73% and 37%-81%, respectively, across four soil types, in comparison to the control without straw and bacterial agents (N), with the greatest reduction recorded in the mortar black soil (by 73% for NS and 81% for NSS). Meanwhile, the NS and NSS treatments resulted in a significant increase in cumulative N2O emissions (by 289% for NS and 598% for NSS) in the acidic brown soil with a soil pH ranging between 4.8 and 6.5, but showed no significant effect in the remaining three soil types in which soil pH is above 7.5. When compared to the NS treatment, NSS treatment reduced the cumulative N2O emissions in the fluvo-aquic soil by 42%. We further showed that soil type is the primary driver of bacterial community composition (R-2 = 62.3%; P < 0.001), followed by soil depth (R-2 = 5.2%; P < 0.001). The incorporation of straw and denitrifying bacterial agents induced significant change in the bacterial community in the middle depth layers, and increases in nosZ gene abundance and the relative abundance of inoculant-similar OTUs significantly by 0.5-37 folds and 2.8-6900 folds, respectively, in all soil types, suggesting the colonization of denitrifying bacterial agents. Our results further suggested that the Streptomycetales were the most important predictors for N2O emissions, and the relative abundance of Streptomycetales was highly positively correlated with N2O emissions across the four soil types. Overall, the study suggests that deep straw incorporation as soil amendment is effective in mitigating nitrate leaching in all four soil types, especially in the fluvo-aquic soil, due to its dual effects on controlling nitrate leaching and N2O emissions. However, it is not recommended for the acidic brown soils as it may cause increased N2O emissions.

AB Biochar application and irrigation management are widely regarded as effective strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural systems. However, the combined effects of these two approaches on greenhouse gas emissions remain insufficiently understood. This study investigated how different biochar application rates and irrigation strategies affect soil moisture and temperature, as well as the relationship between soil moisture, temperature, and greenhouse gas emissions. A two-year field experiment was conducted in the North China Plain to investigate the combined impact of deficit irrigation and biochar on greenhouse gas emissions in a summer maize-winter wheat rotation system. The experiment included three irrigation strategies (full irrigation (F: 70 %-80 % field capacity (theta(fc))), deficit irrigation (D: 50 %-60 % theta(fc)) during the jointing stage of maize and wheat (DJ), and deficit irrigation during the jointing stage and filling stage of maize and wheat (D-J+F)) and 3 biochar application rates (T: 0 t ha(-1) biochar, M: 15 t ha(-1) biochar, and H: 30 t ha(-1) biochar). The results showed that water-filled pore space (WFPS) and soil temperature were positively correlated with CO2 and N2O emission fluxes but had no significant relationship with CH4 emission flux. Decreasing irrigation and increasing biochar application led to a reduction in cumulative soil CO2 and N2O emissions, alongside an increase in CH4 absorption. The interaction between deficit irrigation and biochar application effectively reduced overall soil greenhouse gas emissions. Under high biochar application (H), deficit irrigation during the jointing stage of maize and wheat decreased the global warming potential by 15.9 %, with a minimal yield loss of only 4.86 %. These findings suggest that targeted deficit irrigation, combined with biochar application, is a promising strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while minimizing crop yield losses.

AB Straw return is an effective conservation tillage measure that improves soil properties, increases crop yields, and is an efficient means of reusing agrobioenergy by-products. Straw return has been shown to affect nitrogen (N) cycling and related functional microbes in agricultural soils. However, the relationship between nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and N-related functional genes under different straw return strategies in wheat-corn double cropping systems remains elusive. Here, we conducted a short-term field study to investigate the response of N2O emissions driven by N cycling functional genes (bacterial and archaeal amoA genes and nirS, nirK, and nosZ genes) to different straw return patterns in a wheat-corn double cropping system in the North China Plain. Three treatments were established, namely, both wheat and corn straw return (CWSR), only wheat straw mulch return (WSR), and no straw return (NSR). Over the wheat-corn season, the total N2O emissions significantly increased by 31.74% and 12.37% in CWSR and WSR-treated soils, respectively. Straw return increased nitrifying and denitrifying functional gene abundances, thus stimulating N2O emissions. Correlation analysis showed that AOA (r = 0.262, p < 0.05) and AOB (r = 0.703, p < 0.01) were strongly and positively correlated with NO3--N concentrations, indicating that AOA and AOB were involved in nitrification under straw return. Both nirS (r = 0.287, p < 0.05) and nirK genes (r = 0.252, p < 0.05) were positively correlated with N2O emissions, while nosZ genes (r =-0.266, p < 0.05) were negatively correlated with N2O emissions. Structural equation model (SEM) analysis further revealed that straw return indirectly affected N2O emissions by influencing the abundances of AOB-amoA (r = 0.324, p < 0.05), nirK (r = 0.417, p < 0.05), and nosZ (r =-0.388, p < 0.001) genes. Overall, short-term straw return increased N2O production in a wheat-corn double cropping system, mainly through increased AOB-amoA and nirK gene abundance, which stimulated N2O production, and reduced nosZ gene abundance, which inhibited N2O reduction.

AB Nitrous acid (HONO) is a crucial precursor of tropospheric hydroxyl radicals, but its sources are not fully understood. Soil is recognized as an important HONO source, but the lack of measurements of soil-atmosphere HONO exchange flux ( F HONO ) has led to uncertainties in modeling its atmospheric impacts and understanding the reactive nitrogen budget. Herein, we conduct F HONO measurements over agricultural fields under fertilized ( F HONO - NP , normal fertilization and irrigation) and non-fertilized ( F HONO - CK , normal irrigation but no fertilization) treatments. Our results show that nitrogen fertilizer use causes a remarkable increase in F HONO - NP . F HONO - NP exhibits distinct diurnal variations, with an average noontime peak of 152 ng N m - 2 s - 1 . The average F HONO - NP within 3 weeks after fertilization is 97.7 +/- 8.6 ng N m - 2 s - 1 , around 2 orders of magnitude higher than before fertilization, revealing the remarkable promotion effect of nitrogen fertilizer on HONO emissions.We also discuss other factors influencing soil HONO emissions, such as meteorological parameters and soil properties/nutrients. Additionally, we estimate the HONO emission factor of 0.68 +/- 0.07 % relative to the applied nitrogen during the whole growing season of summer maize. Accordingly, the fertilizer-induced soil HONO emission is estimated to be 22.3 and 60.8 Gg N yr - 1 in the North China Plain (NCP) and mainland China, respectively, representing a significant reactive nitrogen source. Furthermore, our observations reveal that soil emissions sustain a high level of daytime HONO, enhancing the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and aggravating O 3 pollution in the NCP. Our results indicate that to mitigate regional air pollution effectively, future policies should consider reactive nitrogen emissions from agricultural soils.

AB The performance of the DNDC and Daisy model to simulate the water dynamics in a floodplain soil of the North China Plain was tested and compared. While the DNDC model uses a simple cascade approach, the Daisy model applies the physically based Richard's equation for simulating water movement in soil. For model testing a three years record of the soil water content from the Dong Bei Wang experimental station near Beijing was used. There, the effect of nitrogen fertilization, irrigation and straw removal on soil water and nitrogen dynamics was investigated in a three factorial field experiment applying a split-split-plot design with 4 replications. The dataset of one treatment was used for model testing and calibration. Two other independent datasets from further treatments were employed for validating the models. For both models, the simulation results were not satisfying using default parameters. After parameter optimisation and the use of site-specific van Genuchten parameters, however, the Daisy model performed well. But, for the DNDC model, parameter optimisation failed to improve the simulation result. Owing to the fact that many biological processes such as plant growth, nitrification or denitrification depend strongly on the soil water content, our findings bring us to the conclusion that the site-specific suitability of the DNDC model for simulating the soil water dynamics should be tested before further simulation of other processes.

AB No-till (NT), straw incorporation (SI) and optimized N fertilization are important mitigation options for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agroecosystems. These measures may also help to maintain high crop production and are frequently recommended for use in northern China. Few studies, however, have addressed the interactive effects of these conservation and fertilization practices with respect to GHG emissions and crop yields. We report on a field experiment conducted in two consecutive dry years (2013-2015) when precipitation was much lower than the long-term average. We examined the effects of three different N fertilizer application rates, tillage practice and straw management on crop yields, GHG, area-scaled GHG (in global warming potential) and net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) of a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in northern China. Results showed that reducing N fertilizer significantly decreased soil N2O emissions without affecting annual crop yields. Compared with the average of all other fertilization treatments, the no-till x straw incorporation (NT x SI) practice increased both wheat and maize yields. However, in the maize season, NT also increased cumulative N2O emissions compared with conventional tillage (CT). The practices of combining N fertilization with straw management conferred an additional effect on 1920 emissions when compared with single practices (i.e, fertilization or straw management). Compared with straw removal (SR) treatments, SI increased annual cumulative N2O emissions by 37% for the conventional N fertilization, but decreased them by 13% at the optimized N fertilization. Neither single practice nor integrated practices had a significant effect on cumulative CH4 uptake. The highest NEEB values were obtained in NT x SI x optimal N fertilization (OPT) and NT x SR x OPT in the 1st and 2nd cropping years, respectively. We conclude that, when considering the additional benefits of SI for improving soil fertility and C sequestration, the NT x SI x OPT practice would be a viable strategy to achieve high crop yields, while simultaneously reducing GHG emissions.

AB Lack of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is generally one of the key factors limiting denitrification in subsoil beneath the root zone. Despite a number of laboratory DOC amendment studies, the effects of in situ DOC infiltration on subsoil denitrification, and on subsequent end product composition, are less understood. Here, we report on the effects of in situ infiltration of a DOC-rich liquid, derived from decomposing straw, on potential denitrification rate (PDR), N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio, and nitrate stock in a 0-2 m soil profile. The results showed that in situ infiltration with a DOC-rich liquid (100 mm, 2 ton DOC ha(-1)) significantly increased the DOC concentration and PDR, and significantly decreased the N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio in the soil profile. Up to 70% of the nitrate accumulated in the 0-2 m soil profile disappeared within three weeks following the infiltration of the DOC-rich liquid. The majority of the nitrate removed could be accounted for by denitrification. The predominant end product of denitrification was N-2.

AB Incorporating crop residues into the soil is an effective method for improving soil carbon sequestration, fertility, and crop productivity. Such potential benefits, however, may be offset if residue addition leads to a substantial increase in soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study aimed to quantify the effect of different crop residues with varying C/N ratios and different nitrogen (N) fertilizers on GHG emissions, yield, and yield-scaled emissions (GHGI) in winter wheat. The field experiment was conducted during the 2018-2019 winter wheat season, comprising of four residue treatments (no residue, maize residue, soybean residue, and maize-soybean mixed residue) and four fertilizer treatments (control, urea, manure, and manure + urea). The experiment followed a randomized split-plot design, with N treatments as the main plot factor and crop residue treatments as the sub-plot factor. Except for the control, all N treatments received 150 kg N ha(-1) season(-1). The results showed that soils from all treatments acted as a net source of N2O and CO2 fluxes but as a net sink of CH4 fluxes. Soybean residue significantly increased soil N2O emissions, while mixed residue had the lowest N2O emissions among the three residues. However, all residue amendments significantly increased soil CO2 emissions. Furthermore, soybean and mixed residues significantly increased grain yield by 24% and 21%, respectively, compared to no residue amendment. Both soybean and mixed residues reduced GHGI by 25% compared to maize residue. Additionally, the urea and manure + urea treatments exhibited higher N2O emissions among the N treatments, but they contributed to significantly higher grain yields and resulted in lower GHGI. Moreover, crop residue incorporation significantly altered soil N dynamics. In soybean residue-amended soil, both NH4+ and NO3- concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.05). Conversely, soil NO3- content was notably lower in the maize-soybean mixed residue amendment. Overall, our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how different residue additions from different cropping systems influence soil N dynamics and GHG emissions, offering valuable insights into effective agroecosystems management for long-term food security and soil sustainability while mitigating GHG emissions.

AB Large quantities and many varieties of agricultural organic wastes are produced in China annually. Applying agricultural organic wastes to soil plays an essential role in coping with the environmental pollution from agricultural wastes, solving the energy crisis and responding global climate change. But there is little information available on the effects of different agricultural organic wastes on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The objectives of this study were to investigate and compare the impacts of different organic wastes on soil GHG emissions during a 4-year field experiments in the North China Plain, as well as analyze the influential factors that may be related to GHG emissions. The treatments were: crop straw (CS), biogas residue (BR), mushroom residue (MR), wine residue (WR) and pig manure (PM) returning to soil, as well as a control with no organic waste applied to soil but chemical fertilizer addition only (CF). The results showed that compared with CF treatment, organic material applied to soil significantly increased GHG emissions and emissions followed the order of WR(27,961.51 kg CO2-eq/ha/yr) > PM (26,376.50 kg CO2-eq/haiyr) > MR(23,366.60 kg CO2-eq/ha/yr) > CS(22,434.44 kg CO2-eq/ha/yr) > BR (22,029.04 kg CO2-eq/haiyr) > CF(17,402.77 kg CO2-eq/haiyr), averagely. And considering the affecting factors, GHG emissions were significantly related to soil temperature and soil water content. Different organic wastes also affected soil total organic carbon (TOC), microbial carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents, which related to GHG emissions. Further analysis showed that characteristics of organic wastes affected GHG emissions, which included C-N ratio, lignin, polyphenol, cellulose and hemicellulose. Our study demonstrates that biogas residue returning to soil emitted minimum GHG emissions among these different types of organic wastes, which provided a better solution for applying organic wastes to mitigate soil GHG emissions.

AB As one of the greatest political and scientific issues, global warming is affecting the terrestrial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles and subsequently greenhouse gases (GHGs) fluxes. Straw return is considered as an environmentally friendly management to increase soil health and agricultural productivity. However, little is known about their interactive effects on soil organic matter (SOM) and GHGs emissions. Therefore, we collected two-year data from a field experiment in the North China Plain (NCP) to elucidate the effects of soil warming (ambient temperature vs. warming +3.8 degrees C) and straw management (straw removal vs. straw return) on soil properties, nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes during winter wheat seasons. Soil warming stimulated the available nutrients (NH4+, NO3-, and dissolved organic C), and thereby increased cumulative CO2 emission by 17.5-25.0% compared with ambient temperature, while had no effect on N2O fluxes. Straw return enhanced soil CO2 and N2O emissions by 11.5-28.3% and 37.1-48.4% compared with straw removal, respectively. This was mainly due to increased organic matter input stimulating microbial activity, thereby accelerating soil C and N cycling. The NCP was found to be a CH4 sink, and soil warming and straw return increased the CH 4 uptake. Finally, soil warming combined straw return resulted in the highest GHGs budget, and we estimated that almost 7.1 t CO2-eq ha(-1) per wheat season would be lost in response to soil warming and straw return in the NCP. In the second growing season, soil organic C (SOC) and total N (TN) were reduced under warming by 6.1% and 4.9% due to the stimulated decomposition and mineralization, respectively. However, the decreases considerably counteracted by straw return, which enhanced the SOC and TN by 5.8% and 9.4%, respectively. Our study suggested that soil warming and straw return will lead to stimulated GHGs emissions in wheat seasons in the NCP, while straw return may contribute to the mitigation of global warming through increasing SOM accumulation.

AB Appropriate nitrogen (N) application increases crop yield, while its unreasonable application results in environmental problem. Determining the appropriate N application rate is the key to sustainable development. Here, the denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model was used to analyze the effects of N fertilizer on maize yields, economic benefits, nitrate leaching, and nitrous oxide emissions in China. The N application rate for the trade-off between economy and environment at the county scale was further determined. The geodetector model was used to identify the main driving factors and their interactions of the recommended N rate in each agricultural zone. The results showed that the recommended N rate was generally high in the northwest but low in the south, consistent with the spatial patterns of yield potential. However, clay soils with clay ratios greater than 34% in southern China and sandy soils with bulk densities greater than 1.5 g cm(-3) on the Huanghuaihai Plain experienced high N levels and low yields, and thus soils need to be improved. Potential grain yield was the main driving factor in most zones, yet its effects gradually weakened from north to south. The influence of soil characteristics increased from north to south. It was found that the current average N application rate of farmers in China was 249 kg N/ha, and 86.55% of counties had excessive N applications. Compared to the regional optimal N rate at a regional scale, a differentiated N application strategy at the county scale determined in this study increased maize yield and economic benefit by 10.51% and 10.85%, respectively, and reduced N2O emissions and NO3- leaching by 28.72% and 33.60%, respectively. The current research provides a scientific basis for China to formulate a win-win N management strategy for economy and environment and provides a method reference for other countries.

AB A study was conducted to assess the effect of long-term fertilization on soil fertility, crop production and soil CO2 and N2O fluxes. The experiment was initiated in 1990 at the Yucheng Comprehensive Experiment Station located at the North China Plain. Five treatments comprising no fertilizer (0), NK, NP, PK and NPK were included. The yield effects of the chemical fertilizers were in the order of N>P>K. After long-term fertilization, only NPK treatment showed significant higher yields of wheat and maize. Chemical properties of soil were obviously affected by long-term fertilization practices. Soil organic carbon (SOC) increased in all fertilization treatments compared to initial content in the surface depth. While in the depth of 20-40cm and 40-60cm, all treatments showed decreased in SOC content. Total N of surface soil was higher in the NP, NK and NPK treatments with N application and with no significant difference in subsoil (20-60 cm) in all treatments. Available N in the 0-20cm and 40-60cm showed significant higher in NP and NPK treatments. Available P and K increased in treatments received P or K fertilizers respectively. After long-term fertilization, soil CO2 emissions were in the increasing order of no fertilizer, NK, PK, NP and NPK. The differences of CO2 fluxes were related with the chemical properties after long-term fertilization. Soil N2O flux was also affected by the application of N fertilizer during the measurement stage. No fertilizer and PK treatments showed lower N2O emissions. NP, NK and NPK showed higher N2O emission and obvious difference with no fertilizer.

AB Background and aims Greenhouse vegetable production is commonly associated with substantial nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, low nitrogen (N)and irrigation water use efficiency (NUE and IWUE) due to excess N input and frequent flooding irrigation, so it is crucial to develop irrigation and fertilization strategies to alleviate N2O emissions while ensuring vegetable productivity.
   Methods An experiment spanning three crop rotations of cucumber and celery in a greenhouse was conducted in North China Plain (NCP). It included four treatments, i.e., no N fertilizer (CK), farmers' conventional fertilization (FP), conventional fertilization rate with drip fertigation (FPD), and reduced N fertilizer rate with drip fertigation (RFPD).
   Results The mean annual area-scaled, yield-scaled N2O emissions and direct N2O emission factors (EFd) of FP were 36 kg N ha(-1), 175 g N t(-1) and 1.3%, respectively. FPD significantly reduced N2O emissions by over 25% (both in area- and yield-scaled), enhanced IWUE by 37%, and had no significant negative effects on vegetable yield or NUE. RFPD also significantly mitigated both area- and yield-scaled N2O emissions by about 45%, improved IWUE by 40% and NUE by 25%, while maintaining vegetable yield. Quadratic curves were fitted to the boundary points of ln-transformed N2O emissions against soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS), with the maximum N2O losses occurring at 19.5 celcius or 68%. N2O emissions responded to IWUE and NUEs following an exponential (R-2 = 0.71, P < 0.001) and a linear-plateau model (R-2 = 0.67, P < 0.001), respectively.
   Conclusions Drip irrigation with reduced N fertilizer rate is a suitable agronomic practice to simultaneously mitigate N2O emissions and improve both IWUE and NUE while maintaining vegetable yield from typical greenhouse cucumber-celery fields in NCP.

AB Agricultural soils are major sources of the greenhouse gas N2O, particularly under maize with high nitrogen (N) inputs and excessive irrigation. To determine how N and water management can mitigate N2O emissions from drip-irrigated maize fields, a field study was carried out in the North China Plain during the maize growing season. The objective of the study was to investigate the individual and combined effects of irrigation level and N input on N2O emissions and grain yields, as well as N and water use efficiency (WUE), under drip-fertigation management. The main treatments were two irrigation levels: 50 mm/event (sufficient irrigation, W-H) and 25 mm/event (limited irrigation, W-L), with four N application rates: 0 (N-0), 90 (N-1), 180 (N-2), and 270 (N-3) kg N ha(-1). Pulses of N2O emissions were recorded every 2-3 d following each irrigation or fertigation (irrigation + fertilization) event. N input, irrigation, and their interactions all significantly influenced N2O emissions. A significant exponential relationship (P < 0.05) was observed between N application rate and cumulative and yield-scaled N2O emissions in both irrigation treatments. The cumulative N2O emission fluxes from the N-0, N-1, N-2, and N-3 levels of fertilizer with W-L were 11.4, 13.8, 27.2, and 58.8% lower, respectively, than those from the same N levels with W-H; this occurred because high pulses of N2O were avoided during low irrigation conditions. Under W-H, denitrification was the likely source of the high amounts of N2O, whereas nitrification was likely the main source of N2O emissions under W-L. The variations in the water-filled pore space (WFPS) between the two irrigation treatments may explain these results. The effect of N fertilizer on grain yield and WUE depended on the availability of soil water. Based on the available soil water content, the regulation of N fertilizer application can increase yield and also reduce cumulative and yield-scaled N2O emissions. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB The cultivation of silage crops is encouraged to enhance the connection between crop and livestock production in the North China Plain (NCP). A field experiment was designed to evaluate the ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) emissions of five silage cropping systems, including triticale-summer maize (Tr-SuM), triticale-spring maize (Tr-SpM), triticale-double forage maize (Tr-DFM), double forage maize (DFM), and winter wheat-summer maize (WW-SuM), as well as their biomass- and crude protein-scaled emission intensities, with respect to NH3 and greenhouse gas (GHG). The annual nitrogen (N) emissions through NH3, N2O, and CH4 emissions of these systems were 13.43-23.77 kg ha(-1) (4.2-5.6% of N fertilizer input), 3.43-4.56 kg ha(-1) (0.75-1.08% of N fertilizer input) and 2.10-2.85 kg ha(-1), respectively. The total GHG emissions of these systems was dominated by the contributions of N2O. Ranking these systems according to their biomass and crude protein production gave Tr-DFM > DFM > WW-SuM > Tr-SuM and Tr-SpM, their partial factor productivity was in the order of Tr-DFM > WW-SuM > Tr-SuM and Tr-SpM > DFM, and the order of their emission intensity was DFM > Tr-SuM > Tr-DFM > WW-SuM > Tr-SpM. In conclusion, the Tr-DFM needs to be further investigated for its suitability in the NCP, owing to its superior productivity and moderate emission intensities.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a long-lived greenhouse gas with a large radiation intensity and it is emitted mainly from agricultural land. Accurate estimates of total direct N2O emissions from croplands on a country scale are important for global budgets of anthropogenic sources of N2O emissions and for the development of effective mitigation strategies. The objectives of this study were to re-estimate direct N2O emissions using localized emission factors and a database of measurements from Chinese croplands. We obtained N2O emission factors for paddy fields (0.41 +/- 0.04 %) and uplands (1.05 +/- 0.02 %) from a normalization process through cube root transformation of the original data. After comparing the results of normalization from the original values, Logarithmic and cube root transformations were used because the frequency of the original data was not normally distributed. Direct N2O emissions from Chinese croplands from 1980 to 2007 were estimated using IPCC (2006) guidelines combined with separate localized emission factors for paddy fields and upland areas. Direct N2O emissions from paddy fields showed little change, increasing by 10.5% with an annual rate of increase of 0.4% from 32.3 Gg N2O-N in 1980 to 35.7 Gg N2O-N in 2007. In contrast, emissions from uplands changed dramatically, increasing by 308% with an annual rate of 11% from 68.0 Gg N2O-N in 1980 to 278 Gg N2O-N in 2007. Total direct N2O emissions from Chinese croplands increased by 213% with an annual rate of 7.6% from 100 Gg N2O-N in 1980 to 313 Gg N2O-N in 2007, and were determined mainly by upland emissions (accounting for 67.8-88.6% of total emissions from 1980 to 2007). Synthetic N fertilizers played a major role in N2O emissions from agricultural land, and the magnitude of the contributions to total direct N2O emissions made by different amendments was synthetic N fertilizer > manure > straw, representing about 78, 15, and 6% of total direct N2O emissions, respectively, between 2000 and 2007. The spatial pattern of total N2O emissions in 2007 in China shows that high direct N2O emissions occurred mainly in the north and in the Sichuan Basin in the southwest. The provinces with the highest emissions were Henan (35.4 Gg) and Shandong (31.6 Gg) and Tibet had the lowest (0.65 Gg). High direct N2O emissions per unit of arable land occurred mainly on the North China Plain and the southeast coast. The mean value nationally was 2.52 kg N ha(-1), with 18 provinces above this value and with emissions of >4.0 kg N ha(-1) in Beijing, Tianjin and in Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian and Henan provinces.

AB With the increasing use of chemical fertilizers, negative environmental impacts have greatly increased as a result from agricultural fields. The fungus Trichoderma viride used as a biofertilizer can efficiently reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from subtropical tea fields in southern China. In this paper, it was further found that T. viride biofertilizer could alleviate nitrogen (N) leaching in tea fields. Gross N leaching was 1.51 kg ha(-1) year(-1) with no external fertilizer input, but when 225 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)was applied, it increased to 12.38 kg ha(-1) year(-1) using T. viride biofertilizer but 53.46 kg ha(-1) year(-1) using urea. Stepwise linear regression analysis identified the factors responsible for N leaching to be soil nitrate concentration and soil interflow, simulated here using the water balance simulation model (WaSiM-ETH). Finally, mass-scale production of T. viride biofertilizer from waste reutilization using sweet potato starch wastewater and rice straw was found to be cost-effective and feasible. These procedures could be considered a best management practice to reduce N leaching from tea fields in subtropical areas of central China and to reduce pollution from other agricultural waste products.

AB CONTEXT: Modelling approaches have already been used to quantitatively assess the trade-offs between crop yield and N2O emissions as impacted by management practices. However, the model's performance in terms of predicting N2O emissions was mainly assessed against total emissions per growing season or year, which may reduce accuracy in modelling due to the uncertainties in total emissions estimated using the manual (static) chamber method.
   OBJECTIVE: Here, a comparison between optimizations for Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) with total N2O emissions and daily N2O emissions was conducted. We further used the validated model to develop simple surrogate models for estimating total N2O emissions in different years and target potential opportunities to reduce N2O emissions while still maintaining the grain yield under long-term climatic conditions.
   METHODS: Five parameters relating to denitrification and nitrification were optimized using differential evolution algorithm for global optimization based on two-year field experimental data at Huantai site in North China Plain, and comprehensive simulation experiments were further conducted under long-term climate variability in an irrigated wheat-maize rotation system. The method of Levenberg-Marquardt was implemented to fit simple surrogate models for estimating total N2O emissions in different years, and Analysis of Variance was used for model comparison.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: APSIM model optimized with daily N2O emissions could better simulate soil N2O and nitrate dynamics than that optimized with total N2O emissions. We obtained the posterior distributions of five key parameters to which N2O emissions are sensitive, and demonstrated that original model using default parameters could underestimate the rate of nitrification and denitrification and the subsequent N2O emissions. Total N2O emissions increased exponentially with nitrogen application rate and mean temperature, and IPCC (1% emission factor) could underestimate whole-year N2O emissions when N rate was higher than the optimized nitrogen rate for crop production. We also found that there was potential to optimize nitrogen fertiliser rate to reduce N2O emissions while still maintaining crop yield in the irrigated wheat-maize rotation system.
   SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated the necessity of optimization with daily N2O emissions in improving model accuracy, and the posterior distributions of five parameters relating to N2O emissions offered reference range for future model improvement and applications.

AB Understanding the effects of warming on greenhouse gas (GHG, such as N2O, CH4 and CO2) feedbacks to climate change represents the major environmental issue. However, little information is available on how warming effects on CHG fluxes in farmland of North China Plain (NCP). An infrared warming simulation experiment was used to assess the responses of N2O, CI-I-4 and CO2 to warming in wheat season of 2012-2014 from conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems. The results showed that warming increased cumulative N2O emission by 7.7% in CT but decreased it by 9.7% in NT fields (p < 0.05). Cumulative CH4 uptake and CO2 emission were increased by 28.7%-51.7% and 6.3%-15.9% in both two tillage systems, respectively (p < 0.05). The stepwise regressions relationship between GHG fluxes and soil temperature and soil moisture indicated that the supply soil moisture due to irrigation and precipitation would enhance the positive warming effects on CHG fluxes in two wheat seasons. However, in 2013, the long-term drought stress due to infrared wanning and less precipitation decreased N2O and CO2 emission in warmed treatments. In contrast, warming during this time increased CH4 emission from deep soil depth. Across two years wheat seasons, warnaing significantly decreased by 30.3% and 63.9% sustained-flux global warming potential (SGWP) of N20 and CH4 expressed as CO2 equivalent in CT and NT fields, respectively. However, increase in soil CO2 emission indicated that future wan-ning projection might provide positive feedback between soil C release and global warming in NCP.

AB The gaseous losses of fertilizer nitrogen (N) applied to agroecosystems are a major contributor to a host of environmental problems, inefficient production systems, and decreased N-use efficiency. These losses lead to the wastage of resources, increasing the greenhouse effect and harming human health. The red soil hilly region of Southeast China houses the biggest orchard area of the world, and nitrogen fertilizers are usually heavily applied to the orchard systems in China. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the gaseous losses of the fertilizer N by ammonia (NH3) volatilization and denitrification losses using the venting method and acetylene inhibition method respectively, and to assess the potential environmental risk of NH3 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from this orchard system based on the recent orchard management practices. An experiment was conducted in an Ougan citrus (Citrus reticulata Blanco 'Suavissima') orchard in the red soil hilly region of Southeast China. Three fertilization treatments, including the control (no N fertilizer, CK), poultry manure (at a rate of 6.3 t/ha, OM), and conventional fertilization (OM 6.3 t/ha + chemical fertilizer 393 kg N/ha, CF), were used. In all treatments, the fertilizers were incorporated into the soil after application. The test results, which were continuously determined within one year, indicated that the NH3 volatilization losses accounted for 4.5% of the OM nitrogen (OM-N) and 2.9% of the CF nitrogen (CF-N), whereas the denitrification N losses accounted for 2.1% of the OM-N and 2.9% of the CF-N. Overall, the total gaseous N losses (including NH3 volatilization losses and denitrification N losses) were 5.8% in the CF treatment. A relatively higher N2O flux, accounting for 1.8% of the CF-N, emitted from the CF treatment.

AB Enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs), including nitrification inhibitors (NIs) and slow-release fertilizer (SRF), are considered promising approaches for mitigating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions while improving crop yield. This study investigated the combined application of EENFs with improved water and fertilizer management in an intensively irrigated spring maize rotation over five years in North-western China. High-frequency measurements of N2O fluxes were made throughout each year (both during crop growth and the fallow season) in five treatments: no N fertilizer as a control (CK), conventional N fertilization and irrigation (Con), optimum N fertilization and irrigation (Opt, 33% reduction in N fertilizer and 25% reduction of irrigation water), optimum N fertilization and irrigation with nitrification inhibitor (Opt + NI), and optimum N fertilization and irrigation with slow-release fertilizer (Opt-SRF). Annual mean cumulative N2O emissions reached 0.31 +/- 0.07, 3.66 +/- 0.19, 1.87 +/- 0.16, 1.23 +/- 0.13, and 1.61 +/- 0.16 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for CK, Con, Opt, Opt thorn NI, and Opt-SRF, respectively, with annual mean nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of 36, 54, 61 and 59% for Con, Opt, Opt thorn NI, and Opt-SRF, respectively. The Opt, Opt thorn NI and Opt-SRF treatments significantly reduced cumulative N2O emissions by 49%, 66%, and 56% (P < 0.05), respectively, and increased NUE by 51%, 70%, and 66% (P < 0.05), respectively, relative to Con. However, mean above-ground N uptake (288-309 kg N ha(-1)) and mean grain yields (12.7-12.8 Mg ha(-1)) did not differ significantly between the Con, Opt, Opt thorn NI, and Opt-SRF treatments during the five-year study. High N2O emissions mainly occurred within a few days of fertilization with irrigation, which could have been produced by microbially-mediated nitrifier or nitrifier denitrification processes. The fallow seasons had significantly lower cumulative N2O emissions, which were mainly attributed to the low temperature, low N inputs of crop residues, and low soil moisture conditions. Our study clearly indicated that the combined application of EENFs with optimum N fertilization and irrigation management can reduce environmental impacts while maintaining high crop yields in dryland regions such as Northwest China.

AB Mulching and biochar are increasingly used individually in agriculture, but little is known about their combined effects on N2O distribution and dispersion in ridge and furrow profiles. We conducted a 2-year field experiment in northern China to determine soil N2O concentrations using the in situ gas well technique and calculate N2O fluxes from ridge and furrow profiles by the concentration gradient method. The results showed that mulch and biochar increased soil temperature and moisture and altered the mineral nitrogen status, leading to a decrease in the relative abundance of nitrification genes in the furrow area and an increase in the relative abundance of denitrification genes, with denitrification remaining as the main source of N2O production. N2O concentrations in the soil profile increased significantly after fertiliser application, and N2O concentrations in the ridge area of the mulch treatment were much higher than those in the furrow area, where vertical and horizontal diffusion occurred. Biochar addition was effective in reducing N2O concentrations but had no effect on the N2O distribution and diffusion pattern. Soil temperature and moisture, but not soil mineral nitrogen, explained the variation in soil N2O fluxes during the non-fertiliser application period. Compared to furrow-ridge planting (RF), furrow-ridge mulch planting (RFFM), furrow-ridge planting with biochar (RBRF) and furrow-ridge mulch planting with biochar (RFRB) resulted in 9.2%, 11.8% and 20.8% increases in yield per unit area and 1.9%, 26.3% and 27.4% decreases in N2O fluxes per unit of yield, respectively. The interaction between mulching and biochar significantly affected the N2O fluxes per unit of yield. Biochar costs aside, RFRB is very promising for increasing alfalfa yields and reducing N2O fluxes per unit of yield.

AB Oxygen (O-2) is a key factor driving the expression of N-cycle-related functional genes and regulating nitrogenous gas production in the soil. However, how and to what extent the associated gene transcription and corresponding gas kinetics interact with the transition of soil O-2 status caused by N fertilisation, remains poorly understood. In this context, we conducted a robotized incubation experiment using a He/O-2 atmosphere with different amounts of ammonium-based fertiliser (0 (control), 60 (AS(60)) and 200 mg N kg(-1) (NH4)(2)SO4 (AS(200))) applied to an agricultural soil with a strong nitrification potential under three different initial O-2 levels (oxic 21%, sub-oxic 3%, and anoxic 0%) over 14 days. Through repeated measurements of N2O, NO, and N-2 concentrations and kinetics of mineral N following the decline of O-2 concentrations, we found that higher ammonium addition (200 vs. 60 mg N kg(-1)) caused faster O-2 consumption in the headspace and induced up to 238 times higher net accumulation of N2O under initially oxic headspace condition. We speculate that this was due to: 1) the rapid transition of O-2 status from oxic to anoxic due to vigorous ammonia oxidation; and 2) the increased N2O/(N2O + NO + N-2) ratio of denitrification with higher N addition. The amoA and nosZ gene transcript numbers changed significantly in response to ammonium addition and decreasing O-2 concentration, whereas high-throughput sequencing revealed a significant structural alteration of the soil microbiota along with the transition of O-2 status. Our results highlight that the vigorousness of oxygen depletion in the soil matrix driven by rapid ammonia oxidation is the proximal factor that regulates gas kinetics in high nitrification-potential soil when O-2 diffusion is limited. This implies that practices which reduce hotspots of ammonia oxidation have the potential to mitigate N2O emissions from nitrifier denitrification and denitrification in agricultural soil.

AB The effects of nitrogen and straw management on global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in a winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping system on the North China Plain were investigated. We measured nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and studied net GWP (NGWP) and GHGI by calculating the net exchange of CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) from greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural inputs and management practices, as well as changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), based on a long-term field experiment established in 2006. The field experiment includes six treatments with three fertilizer N levels (zero N (control), optimum and conventional N) and straw removal (i.e. N-0 N-opt and N-con) or return (i.e. SN0, SNopt and SNcon). Optimum N management (N-opt, SNopt) saved roughly half of the fertilizer N compared to conventional agricultural practice (N-con, SNcon), with no significant effect on grain yields. Annual mean N2O emissions reached 3.90 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in N-con and SNcon, and N2O emissions were reduced by 46.9% by optimizing N management of N-opt and SNopt. Straw return increased annual mean N2O emissions by 27.9 %. Annual SOC sequestration was 0.40-1.44Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in plots with N application and/or straw return. Compared to the conventional N treatments the optimum N treatments reduced NGWP by 51 %, comprising 25% from decreasing N2O emissions and 75% from reducing N fertilizer application rates. Straw return treatments reduced NGWP by 30% compared to no straw return because the GWP from increments of SOC offset the GWP from higher emissions of N2O, N fertilizer and fuel after straw return. The GHGI trends from the different nitrogen and straw management practices were similar to the NGWP. In conclusion, optimum N and straw return significantly reduced NGWP and GHGI and concomitantly achieved relatively high grain yields in this important winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping system.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the impact of mitigation practices (slurry application methods and inhibitors applications) on gas emissions and identify the soil N2O production pathways in cattle slurry applied soil using isotopocule mapping approach. First, we compared the NH3 and N2O emissions of cattle slurry applied soil in a summer maize field experiment in north China plain (NCP) with four treatments: control (CK, no fertilization), slurry application using surface (SA-S), slurry application using band application (BA-S), and chemical fertilizer application using band application (BA-C). Then, an incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the mitigation effect of nitrification inhibitors (dicyandiamide, DCD) and denitrification inhibitors (procyanidins, PC) and their combination (DCD + PC) on gaseous N emissions with slurry applied using incorporation (IA) or surface application (SA) methods. The results showed that the total gaseous N emissions (N2O-N and NH3-N) in field were in the order of SA-S (1534 mg m(-2)) > BA-S (338 mg m(-2)) > BA-C (128 mg m(-2)) > CK (55 mg m(-2)), and the dominant N loss contributor varied from NH3 in SA-S (similar to 89%) to N2O in BA-S (similar to 94%) and BA-C (similar to 88%). Moreover, the isotopocule mapping approach indicated that emitted N2O of the slurry applied soil in field appeared to have lower rN(2)O values and led to more N2O + N-2 emissions at the initial fertilization period. The incubation experiment indicated that the N2O emissions of slurry-applied soil were significantly reduced by DCD (similar to 45%) and DCD + PC (similar to 67%) application in comparison with CK (p < 0.05), and the stronger contributions of bacterial denitrification/nitrifier denitrification to N2O production were revealed by the lower delta N-15(SP) in N2O using the isotopocule mapping approach. In conclusion, in NCP the gaseous losses of the slurry applied field can be largely reduced by using incorporation method, and greater reduction could be achieved given the simultaneous application of nitrification/denitrification inhibitors.

AB Reuse of biogas slurry (BGS) could reduce fertilizer application rate because this material is an alternative source of nutrients and irrigation that could replace some of applied fertilizer. However, the environmental impacts of BGS irrigation, such as greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are poorly understood. We investigated the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of BGS irrigation by quantifying the nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions under different BGS irrigation rates in a two-year wheat-maize rotation field in the North China Plain. We found BGS irrigation did not change the patterns and fluxes of CO2 and N2O emission during the entire wheat-maize cropping cycle. In addition, there were no significant difference between BGS treatments (BSL, BSM, and BSH) and conventional fertilizer treatment (CF) in GWP. Further, no significant difference occurred in GHGI between BSM (33% BGS and 67% groundwater were mixed and irrigated during the wintering period and joining stage of wheat and after maize sowing, 315 kg.N.hm(-1)), BSH (50% BGS and 50% groundwater were mixed and irrigated during the wintering period and joining stage of wheat and after maize sowing, 477 kg.N.hm(-1)) and CF (conventional NPK fertilizer, 420 kg.N.ha(-1)), despite a higher value BSL (33% BGS and 67% groundwater were mixed and irrigated during the wintering period of wheat and after maize sowing, 210 kg.N.hm(-1)). The BSL and BSM treatments significantly increased the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) compared to the CF treatment (11.3% for BSL and 15.3% for BSM). Despite the lower NUE in the BSH treatment relative to CF, it was not statistically significant. Therefore, BGS reuse can increase NUE and does not cause environmental impacts. According to the results of GHGI and NUE, it can be concluded that BSM should be recommended as an improved recycling management practice for the wheat-maize rotation systems.

AB The elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO(2)) is expected to increase the labile C input to the soil, which may stimulate microbial activity and soil N2O emissions derived from nitrification and denitrification. However, few studies studied the effect of eCO(2) on N2O emissions from maize field under the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) conditions in the warm temperate zone. Here, we report a study conducted during the 12th summer maize season under long-term eCO(2), aiming to investigate the effect of eCO(2) on N2O emissions. Moreover, we tested zero and conventional N fertilization treatments, with maize being grown under either eCO(2) or ambient CO2 (aCO(2)). We hypothesized that N2O emissions would be increased under eCO(2) due to changes in soil labile C and mineral N derived from C-deposition, and that the increase would be larger when eCO(2) was combined with conventional N fertilization. We also measured the activities of some soil extracellular enzymes, which could reflect soil C status. The results showed that, under eCO(2), seasonal N2O and CO2 emissions increased by 12.4-15.6% (p < 0.1) and 13.8-18.5% (p < 0.05), respectively. N fertilization significantly increased the seasonal emissions of N2O and CO2 by 33.1-36.9% and 17.1-21.8%, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of eCO(2) and N fertilization increased the intensity of soil N2O and CO2 emissions. The marginal significant increase in N2O emissions under eCO(2) was mostly due to the lower soil water regime after fertilization in the study year. Dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC) concentration showed a significant increase at most major stages, particularly at the tasseling stage during the summer maize growth period under eCO(2). In contrast, soil mineral N showed a significant decrease under eCO(2) particularly in the rhizospheric soils. The activities of C-related soil extracellular enzymes were significantly higher under eCO(2), particularly at the tasseling stage, which coincided with concurrent increased DOC and MBC under eCO(2). We conclude that eCO(2) increases N2O emissions, and causes a higher increase when combined with N fertilization, but the increase extent of N2O emissions was influenced by environmental factors, especially by soil water, to a great extent. We highlighted the urgent need to monitor long-term N2O emissions and N2O production pathways in various hydrothermal regimes under eCO(2).

AB Optimizing irrigation and nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications is essential to ensure crop yields and lower environmental risks under climate change. The DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was employed to investigate the impacts of irrigation regime (RF, rainfed; MI, minimum irrigation; CI, critical irrigation; FI, full irrigation) and N fertilizer rate(N60, N90, N120, N150, N180, N210, N240, N270, and N300 kg ha-1) on yield and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from winter wheat growing season under different temperature rise levels (+0, +0.5, +1.0, +1.5, and +2.0 degrees C scenar-ios) and precipitation year types (wet, normal, and dry seasons) in the North China Plain. Model evaluations demon-strated that simulated soil temperature, soil moisture, daily N2Oflux, yield, and cumulative N2O emissions weregenerally in close agreement with measurements fromfield experiment over three growing seasons. By adopting simu-lation scenarios analysis, the model was then used to explore the effects of irrigation and N fertilizer inputs to balanceyield and N2O emissions from winter wheat growing season. Based on reduced water and fertilizer inputs and N2Oemissions with little yield penalty, recommended management practices included application of MI-N150 in wet season,CI-N120 in both normal and dry seasons, and CI-N150 for +0 to +2.0 degrees C scenarios. Recommended practices in differentprecipitation year types reduced irrigation amount by 75-150 mm, N rate by 75-105 kg N ha-1, yield by 0.16-0.86 tha-1, cumulative N2O emissions by 0.13-0.64 kg ha-1, and yield-scaled N2O emissions by 15.5-85.0 mg kg-1compared with current practices. The corresponding metrics for different elevated temperature levels decreased by75 mm, 75 kg N ha-1,0.09-0.50 t ha-1,0.12-0.52 kg ha-1,and13.7-72.3 mg kg-1, respectively. The proposed man-agement practices can help to maintain high agronomic productivity and alleviate environmental pollution from agricultural ecosystems, thereby providing an important basis for mitigation strategies to adapt to climate change

Due to the uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall, irrigation is mainly concentrated in the winter wheat growing season in the North China Plain. In this study, we estimated CO2 emission and soil CH4 uptake from winter wheat fields with different irrigation methods and scheduling treatments using the static chamber-gas chromatography method from April to May 2017 and 2018. Treatments included three irrigation methods (surface drip, sprinkler, and border) and three irrigation scheduling levels that initiated as soon as the soil moisture drained to 50%, 60%, and 70% of the field capacity for a 0-100 cm soil profile were tested. The results showed that both the irrigation methods and scheduling significantly influenced (p < 0.05) the cumulative CO2 and CH4 emission, grain yield, global warming potential (GWP), GWP Intensity (GWPI), GWPI per unit irrigation applied, and water use efficiency (WUE). Compared to 60% and 70% FC, 50% FC irrigation scheduling de-creased accumulated CH4 uptake 26.8-30.3% and 17.8-25.4%, and reduced accumulated CO2 emissions 7.0-15.3% and 12.6-19.4%, respectively. Conversely, 50% FC reduced GWP 6.5-13.3% and 12.5-19.4% and lower grain yield 10.4-19.7% and 8.5-16.6% compared to 60% and 70% FC irrigation scheduling in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Compared to sprinkler irrigation and border irrigation, drip irrigation at 60% FC increased the accumulated CH4 uptake 11.3-12.1% and 1.9-5.5%, while reduced the accumulated CO2 emissions from 7.5-8.8% and 10.1-12.1% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Moreover, drip irrigation at 60% FC increased grain yield 5.2-7.5% and 6.3-6.8%, WUE 0.9-5.4% and 5.7-7.4%, and lowered GWP 8.0-9.8% and 10.1-12.0% compared to sprinkler and border irrigation in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The interaction of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods significantly impacted accumulated CH4 uptake, cumulative CO2 amount, and GWP in 2018 only while grain yield and WUE in the entire study. Overall, drip irrigation at 60% FC is the optimal choice in terms of higher grain yield, WUE, and mitigating GWP and GWPI from winter wheat fields in North China Plain.

AB Agricultural soil emissions are a balance between sinks and sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The fluxes of GHGs from soils are complex and spatially and temporally heterogenous. While the soil surface is the exchange site with the atmosphere and is commonly where GHG fluxes are measured, it is important to consider processes occurring throughout the soil profile. To reduce emissions and improve agricultural sustainability we need to better understand the drivers and dynamics (production, consumption, diffusion) of these gases within the soil profile. Due to the heterogeneous nature of GHG processes at small to large scales, it is important to test how these processes differ with depth in different systems. In this study, we measured in situ CO2, N2O and CH4 concentration gradients as a function of soil depth over subsequent maize and wheat growing seasons with active gas samplers inserted into an arable field at 10, 20, 30 and 50 cm depths. We found N2O and CH4 concentrations increased with depth, but only CO2 concentrations differed with depth between growing seasons due likely to differences in soil diffusivity driven by soil conditions. Using the concentration gradient method (GM), the CO2 fluxes at each depth and their contribution to the surface flux were calculated and validated against a chamber method (CM) measured surface flux. We found the GM estimated surface CO2 flux was only 6 % different in the wheat, but 28 % lower than the surface measured flux in the maize growing season, due to drought conditions reducing the accuracy of the GM. Finally, we measured fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 in ambient and highly concentrated headspaces in laboratory mesocosms over a 72 h incubation period. We provide evidence of depth dependent CH4 oxidation and N2O consumption and possibly CO2 fixation. In conclusion, our study provides valuable information on the applicability of the GM and further evidence of the GHG production, consumption and diffusion mechanisms that occur deeper in the soil in a temperate arable context.

AB Context The winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping system with high input and output in the North China Plain (NCP) is the primary source of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. As the climate warms, the NCP faces the challenges of improving agricultural productivity, while reducing carbon footprint.Aims This research aims to explore an optimal cropping system that achieves a balance between high yield and reduced environmental impact, while promoting sustainable agricultural development.Methods On the basis of climate data from 27 global climate models (GCMs), we evaluated the impacts of future climatic change on yield and GHG emissions of five cropping systems by using the Agricultural Production System Simulator Model (APSIM). The cropping systems included winter wheat-summer maize (1Y2MS0, 1-year cycle), winter wheat-summer maize-fallow without/with straw mulching-early maize (2Y3MS0/2Y3MS1, 2-year cycle), early maize-fallow without/with straw mulching (1Y1MS0/1Y1MS1, 1-year cycle).Key results Future climatic change was beneficial for wheat and maize yields for all cropping systems under most climate scenarios. GHG emissions from all cropping systems were projected to increase in the future. However, compared with the conventional intensive 1Y2MS0, cropping system adjustment could decrease indirect emissions from agricultural input, thereby reducing GHG emissions by 21.6-46.0%. Straw mulching during fallow period might slightly increase N2O emissions but could enhance soil carbon sequestration.Conclusions We suggested that 2Y3MS1 was the optimal planting system in the NCP to balance grain yields and GHG emissions in the future.Implications This study can inform cleaner production developments to reduce carbon footprint of regional multi-crop systems.

AB Agricultural soils are major anthropogenic sources of N2O emissions. The application of nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) has been proved to be an effective management measure to mitigate N2O emissions. However, the influence mechanism of DMPP on the mitigation of soil N2O emissions under different irrigation regimes remains unclear. Therefore, a lysimeter experiment was conducted to study the effects of irrigation level (lower irrigation limits of 75%, 65%, and 55% of field capacity (FC), signed as WH, WM, and WL) and DMPP addition (0% and 1% of N application, signed as D0 and D1) on N2O emissions, soil environmental factors such as ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), water-filled pore space (WFPS), soil temperature, and the abundances of N2O-related genes (AOA amoA, AOB amoA, nirS, and nirK). The results showed that soil N2O emissions increased with the increasing of irrigation level. The efficiency of DMPP mitigating N2O emissions varies depending on irrigation regime. Compared to D0, D1 strongly decreased cumulative N2O emissions by 11.27%, 18.96%, and 15.05% in the WL, WM, and WH conditions, respectively. Meanwhile, D1 caused an obvious reduction in the AOB amoA gene by 29.73%, 47.02%, and 22.41%, respectively, but there was no significant effect on the AOA amoA gene. D1 was effective in decreasing nirS and nirK genes except in the WL condition; the percentages of reduction were 48.45%, 40.84% and 37.18%, 44.97% in the WM and WH conditions, respectively. In addition, D1 caused an increase in NH4+-N content and a decrease in NO3--N content, WFPS, and soil temperature in all irrigation regimes. A higher significant correlation was observed between N2O emissions and NH4+-N and AOB amoA in the WL and WM conditions, while a significant correlation was observed between N2O emissions and NO3--N, nirK, and nirS in the WH condition. It was revealed that with the increase in irrigation level, the main source of N2O emissions might change from nitrification to denitrification. Overall, our study indicated that in the WL and WM conditions, the mitigation of N2O emissions by DMPP was primarily attributable to the inhibition of the AOB amoA gene, whereas the inhibition of nirS and nirK genes was likely the dominant mechanism in the WH condition. The findings of this study will provide a theoretical basis for the application of a nitrification inhibitor for drip-irrigated winter wheat fields in the North China Plain.

AB A spatially referenced biophysical model, the water and nitrogen management model (WNMM), was developed and shown to simulate dynamic soil water movement and soil-crop carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling under a given agricultural management, for the purpose of identifying optimal strategies for managing water and fertiliser N under intensive cropping systems (mainly wheat-maize) in the North China Plain and other regions in the world. A uniform data structure, ARC GRID ASCII format, was used both in GIS and WNMM for achieving a close Model-GIS coupling. A significant part of WNMM adopts and modifies concepts and components from widely used models, with a focus on soil N transformations. WNMM simulates the key processes of water dynamics in the surface and subsurface of soils: including evapotranspiration, canopy interception, water movement and groundwater fluctuations; heat transfer and solute transport; crop growth; C and N cycling in the soil-crop system; and agricultural management practices (crop rotation, irrigation, fertiliser application, harvest and tillage). The model runs on a daily time step at any desired scale and is driven by lumped variables (meteorological and crop biological data) in text data format, and spatial variables (soil and agricultural management) in ARC GRID ASCII format. In particular, WNMM simulates all key N transformations in agricultural fields, including mineralisation of fresh crop residue N and soil organic N, formation of soil organic N, immobilisation in biomass, nitrification, ammonia (NH3) volatilisation, denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. WNMM has been successfully applied in Fengqiu County, Henan Province and Luancheng County, Hebei Province, China at site and regional scales. The key WNMM components were intensively calibrated and verified against comprehensive field measurements of soil water content, evapotranspiration, crop leaf area index and yield, NH3 volatilisation, denitrification and N2O emissions as well as nitrate (NO3-)-N concentrations in the soil solution. A sensitivity analysis showed that WNMM was sensitive to changes in meteorological variables, soil hydraulic properties, land use and agricultural management. At the site scale, WNMM simulated well soil water content, crop growth and yield, NH3 volatilisation and soil NO3--N concentration. There was uncertainty in simulating soil denitrification and N2O emissions, when the predicted peaks of denitrification and N2O emissions at very wet conditions could not be confirmed because of limitations in the acetylene-inhibition method for measuring denitrification. At county scale, WNMM simulation of crop yield in Fengqiu County explained 22% of the variation in observed crop yields, and 31% of crop yield variation in Luancheng County where soil variation was less. These results are considered acceptable because factors such as soil salinity and other nutrient deficiencies, which have not been considered in this version of WNMM, may play a role. The source code for the WNMM is available on request. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Appropriate tillage plays an important role in mitigating the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) in regions with higher crop yields, but the emission situations of some reduced tillage systems such as subsoiling, harrow tillage and rotary tillage are not comprehensively studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the emission characteristics of GHG (CH4 and N2O) under four reduced tillage systems from October 2007 to August 2009 based on a 10-yr tillage experiment in the North China Plain, which included no-tillage (NT) and three reduced tillage systems of subsoil tillage (ST), harrow tillage (HT) and rotary tillage (RT), with the conventional tillage (CT) as the control. The soil under the five tillage systems was an absorption sink for CH4 and an emission source for N2O. The soil temperature positive impacted on the CH4 absorption by the soils of different tillage systems, while a significant negative correlation was observed between the absorption and soil moisture. The main driving factor for increased N2O emission was not the soil temperature but the soil moisture and the content of nitrate. In the two rotation cycle of wheat-maize system (10/2007-10/2008 and 10/2008-10/2009), averaged cumulative uptake fluxes of CH4 under CT, ST, HT, RT and NT systems were approximately 1.67, 1.72, 1.63, 1.77 and 1.17 t ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, and meanwhile, approximately 4.43, 4.38, 4.47, 4.30 and 4.61 t ha(-1) year(-1) of N2O were emitted from soil of these systems, respectively. Moreover, they also gained 33.73, 34.63, 32.62, 34.56 and 27.54 t ha(-1) yields during two crop-rotation periods, respectively. Based on these comparisons, the rotary tillage and subsoiling mitigated the emissions of CH4 and N2O as well as improving crop productivity of a wheat-maize cropping system.

AB The impacts of manure application on soil ammonia (NH3) volatilization and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are of interest for both agronomic and environmental reasons. However, how the swine manure addition affects greenhouse gas and N emissions in North China Plain wheat fields is still unknown. A long-term fertilization experiment was carried out on a maize-wheat rotation systemin Northern China (Zea mays L-Triticum aestivum L.) from 1990 to 2017. The experiment included four treatments: (1) No fertilizer (CK), (2) single application of chemical fertilizers (NPK), (3) NPK plus 22.5 t/ha swine manure (NPKM), (4) NPK plus 33.7 t/ha swine manure (NPKM+). A short-termfertilization experiment was conducted from 2016 to 2017 using the same treatments in a field that had been abandoned for decades. The emissions of NH3 and GHGs were measured during the wheat season from 2016 to 2017. Results showed that after long-term fertilization the wheat yields for NPKM treatment were 7105 kg/ha, which were higher than NPK (3880 kg/ha) and NPKM+ treatments (5518 kg/ha). The wheat yields were similar after short-term fertilization (6098-6887 kg/ha). The NH3-N emission factors (EFamm) for NPKM and NPKM+ treatments (1.1 and 1.1-1.4%, respectively) were lower than NPK treatment (2.2%) in both the long and short-term fertilization treatments. In the long-and short-term experiments the nitrous oxide (N2O) emission factors (EFnit) for NPKM+ treatment were 4.2% and 3.7%, respectively, which were higher than for the NPK treatment (3.5% and 2.5%, respectively) and the NPKM treatment (3.6% and 2.2%, respectively). In addition, under long and short-term fertilization, the greenhouse gas intensities for the NPKM+ treatment were 33.7 and 27.0 kg CO2-eq/kg yield, respectively, which were higher than for the NPKM treatment (22.8 and 21.1 kg CO2-eq/kg yield, respectively). These results imply that excessive swine manure application does not increase yield but increases GHG emissions. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Determining appropriate farming management practices to adapt to climate change with lower environmental costs is important for sustainable agricultural production. In this study, a long-term experiment (1985-2019) was conducted under different management practices combining fertilization rate (no, low and high N fertilizer, N0, N1 and N2), straw additions (no, low and high addition, S0, S1 and S2) with conservation tillage (no-tillage, NT) in the North China Plain (NCP). The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model was firstly evaluated using the experimental data, and then applied to simulate the changes of crop yields, soil organic carbon (SOC), and N2O emissions under different management practices combined with climate change scenarios, under low and high emission scenarios of societal development pathways (SSP245 and SSP585, respectively) with climate projections from 2031 to 2100. Under the low emission scenario (SSP245), wheat yields were the highest with the NT-N1-S2 treatment (a 23% increase relative to the baseline (1981-2010)). For maize yields, the NT-N1-S1 treatment increased 46% relative to baseline under the SSP585, whereas, the yields increased less in all treatments under SSP245-2040s. The SOC was predicted to increase by 6-60% by 2100 under SSP245. Straw addition and tillage were the main factors influencing SOC. N fertilizer was the most important driver for wheat and maize yields, however, N2O emissions from soil increased with increased application of N fertilizer. Therefore, the no-tillage method under low N fertilizer and high straw addition (NT-N1-S2) is recommended to promote crop yields and substantially increase SOC under SSP245 and SSP585. Conservation agriculture practices can potentially offset crop yield reductions, increase soil quality, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the NCP, and ensure crop production to meet the growing demand for food under future climate change.

AB The International Research Training Group (IRTG) Project between China Agricultural University and University of Hohenheim, Germany, is focusing on sustainable resource use in North China. One subproject is developing and application of a Regional Agro-Environmental Information System at multi-levels in North China Plain. The major task of this subproject is to estimate the impacts of fertilization, irrigation and land use change on carbon and nitrogen cycles at regional scale. Hence we selected Huimin County in Shandong Province as a case study to do such a research. The purpose of RAEIS at Huimin County is to provide information about (1) the local farming practices in the region, and (2) nutrient management alternatives with the linkage of crop sowed area, and (3) the environmental impacts under different nitrogen management conditions. In this paper, we reported the setup of RAEIS at county level and the method of integrating GIS and biogeochemical model (DNDC) for regional predictions. We also reported first results of the RAEIS for changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) content in 25 years and environmental impacts of conventional and optimal nitrogen management strategies. By GIS tools, the agricultural management practices is geo-referenced to crop variety and soil types, which will be further to find the best management practices for the balance between high yield and environmental safety. Therefore, the RAEIS for Huimin County will provide information of regional nutrient resource management for decision support.

AB Few studies have measured the N2O emission fluxes from vegetable fields. In order to identify the characteristics and the influencing factors of N2O emissions from different vegetable fields, we measured N2O emissions for a full year from four typical fields, including an open-ground vegetable field that has produced vegetables for over 20 years (OV20), a recently developed open-ground vegetable field that was converted from a maize field three years earlier (OV3), a recently developed greenhouse vegetable field that was converted from a maize field 3 years earlier (GV3) and a typical local maize field (Maize). Four different fertilization treatments were set additionally in the recently developed open-ground vegetable field. These were: no fertilizer or manure (OV3_CK), manure only (OV3_M) and the combination of manure with different rates of chemical fertilizer application (OV3_MF1 and OV3_MF3). The results showed that N2O emission fluxes fluctuated between 03 +/- 0.1 and 912.4 +/- 80.0 mg N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) with the highest emission peak occurring after fertilization followed by irrigation. Nitrogen application explained 64.6-84.5% of the N2O emission in the vegetable fields. The magnitude of the emission peaks depended on the nitrogen application rate and the duration of the emission peaks was mainly associated with soil temperature when appropriate irrigation was given after fertilization. The N2O emission peaks occurred later and lasted for a longer period when the soil temperature was <24 degrees C in May. However, emission peaks occurred earlier and lasted for a shorter period when the soil temperature was around 25-33 degrees C from June to August. The annual N2O emissions from the fertilized vegetable fields were 1.68-238 times higher than that from the maize field, which had an emission value of 2.88 +/- 0.10 kg N ha(-1) a(-1). The N2O emission factor (EF) of manure nitrogen was 0.07% over the whole year, but was 0.11% and 0.02% in the spring cucumber season and the autumn cabbage season, respectively. The EF of chemical nitrogen was 1.10-1.78% for the vegetable field over the whole year and it was higher in recently developed vegetable field than in the established field (1.54-1.78% vs. 1.10%). Vegetable fields may contribute greatly to the national greenhouse gas inventories due to the high fertilizer application rates, frequent irrigation and an increased number of tillage-planting cycles.

AB Saline water has proven to be one of the alternative sources of freshwater for agricultural irrigation in water-scarce areas. However, the changes in farmland ecology caused by saline water irrigation remain unclear. In this study, six irrigation water salinities (CK: 1.3 dS m(-1), S1: 3.4 dS m(-1), S2: 7.1 dS m(-1), S3: 10.6 dS m(-1), S4: 14.1 dS m(-1), S5: 17.7 dS m(-1)) were set in a three-year (2019, 2021-2022) experiment to investigate their effects on soil environment and greenhouse gas emissions in cotton fields under long-term saline water irrigation. Results show that soil salinity in the same layer increased as increasing water salinity. Soil moisture of S3-S5 increased significantly by 4.99-12.94%. There was no significant difference in soil organic matter content between CK and S1. Saline water irrigation increased soil ammonium nitrogen content by 0.57-49.26%, while decreasing nitrate nitrogen content by 1.43-32.03%. Soil CO2 and N2O emissions and CH4 uptake were lower in S1-S5 than in CK at different cotton growth stages. In addition, saline water irrigation reduced the global warming potential by 6.93-53.86%. A structural equation model was developed to show that soil salinity, moisture, and ammonium nitrogen content were negatively correlated with global warming potential, while organic matter and nitrate nitrogen had positive effects on global warming potential. Considering the comprehensive perspectives of gas emissions and cotton yield, irrigation water with salinity less than 10.6 dS m(-1) could effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cotton fields while maintaining stable cotton yields in the experimental area and similar region.

AB Optimization of fertilizer and tillage management in agroecosystems can be an effective strategy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and improve carbon sequestration. Using a system boundary that started at winter wheat seeding and ended at summer maize harvest, a field experiment was conducted in Shandong Province (North China) to determine the effect of microbial fertilization and tillage on the carbon footprint (CF). The climate-based ecosystem services were evaluated in wheat-maize cropping systems. Also the optimal microbial fertilization and tillage with the lowest CF, highest climate-based ecosystem services and highest crop yield were determined. The results showed that compared with microbial organic fertilization, the use of microbial decomposing agents increased soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration (2582.1-2909.9 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1)) and reduced CF (0.11-0.12 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) grain). Chemical fertilization was the largest contributor to total CF (27.5-56.7%), which decreased with decreasing chemical fertilization. Climate-based ecosystem services of microbial fertilization with rotary tillage (1689.9-1795.6 US$ ha(-1) yr(-1)) were significantly higher than those of chemical fertilization. In the limited system boundary of wheat-maize cropping, microbial decomposing agent MA (of 30 L ha(-1)) with rotary tillage had the highest grain production, GHG emission mitigation and climate-based ecosystem services enhancement.

AB Although straw mulching and nitrogen applications are extensively practiced in the agriculture sector, large uncer-tainties remain about their impacts on crop yields and especially the environment. The responses of summer maize yields, fertilizer use efficiency, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the North China Plain (NCP) to two straw management practices (S0: no straw and S1: straw mulching) and two nitrogen application rates (N1: 180 and N2: 210 kg N ha(-1)) were investigated in field tests in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The highest yields and partial factor productivity (PFP) were obtained by S1N1, followed by S1N2, S0N1, and S0N2. S1N2 had the highest CO2 emissions and greatest CH4 uptake, S0N1 had the lowest CO2 emissions, and S0N2 had the smallest CH4 uptake. The highest and lowest N2O emissions were found in S0N1 and S1N1, respectively. The S1N2 treatment, an extensively applied practice, had the greatest global warming poten-tial (GWP), which was 70.3 % larger than S1N1 and two times more than S0N1 and S0N2. The largest GHG emission intensity (GHGI) of 19.4 was found in the S1N2 treatment, while the other three treatments, S0N1, S0N2, and S1N1, had a GHGI of 10.1, 10.7, and 10.7, respectively according to three tested results. In conclusion, S1N1 treatment achieved a better trade-off between crop yields and GHG emissions of summer maize in NCP.

AB Spartina alterniflora, an invasive species originating from North America, has spread widely along the eastern coast of China. However, the impacts of S. alterniflora invasions on CH4 and N2O fluxes from salt marshes in eastern China are not fully understood. We conducted a field experiment in three treatments (transparent, opaque, and clipping) to compare the CH4 and N2O fluxes from S. alterniflora community with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities and the mudflat in a coastal wetland of eastern China over one year. CH4 flux from the S. alterniflora community was higher than the S. salsa community and mudflat but lower than the P. australis community. The opaque treatment did not significantly alter CH4 flux, except for the S. salsa community. Clipping significantly decreased CH4 flux from the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities but increased CH4 flux from the S. salsa community. In contrast, N2O fluxes in the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities were lower than for the S. salsa community and mudflat. The opaque treatment did not significantly change N2O fluxes across communities. Clipping significantly increased mean N2O fluxes from the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities but did not significantly change N2O flux in the S. salsa community. CH4 flux was positively related to the aboveground biomass and negatively related to density, whereas N2O flux was negatively related to aboveground biomass and positively related to density. Meanwhile, CH4 flux was strongly dependent on temperature, soil moisture and water depth (P < 0.05), while N2O fluxes under the transparent and opaque chambers were significantly related to water depth (P < 0.05), but N2O flux under the clipping treatment was not significantly related to environmental factors (P > 0.05). Overall, CH4 and N2O fluxes from this coastal wetland were 17.38g m (2) and -36.64 mg m (2), respectively, indicating that S. alterniflora invasions in this salt marsh in eastern China could play a negligible role in emitting CH4 and a significant role in absorbing N2O when compared with other studies worldwide.

AB This paper integrates recent research to improve, test, and verify the process based DeNtrification DeComposition (DNDC) model to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) through a revised FAO Penman -Monteith approach. ET estimates along with biomass and soil water content for spring wheat and corn were improved and found to be in good agreement with the observations at three field sites in eastern Canada (Ottawa). The statistical evaluations (RMSE (mm day(-1)) and R-2) of ET for the newly revised model (0.88 and 0.76 for corn and 0.93 and 0.78 for wheat) showed improvements over DNDC93 (1.95 and 0.22 for corn and 1.62 and 0.09 for wheat) which used the Thornthwaite equation for estimating potential evapotranspiration. In addition, evaluations of water use efficiency for corn and wheat showed good agreement between observations and the modified model. The study demonstrates the inter-dependencies of ET with biomass production and soil/atmosphere water balance. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change has posed serious challenges to food production and sustainable development. We evaluated crop yields, N2O emissions, and soil organic carbon (SOC) in a typical wheat-corn rotation system field on the North China Plain on a 50-year scale using the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model and proposed adaptive strategies for each climate scenarios. The study showed a good consistency between observations and simulations (R-2 > 0.95 and nRMSE < 30%). Among the twelve climate scenarios, we explored ten management practices under four climate scenarios (3 degrees C temperature change: P/T-3 and P/T+3; 30% precipitation change: 0.7P/T and 1.3P/T), which have a significant impact on crop yields and the net greenhouse effect. The results revealed that changing the crop planting time (CP) and using cold-resistant (CR) varieties could reduce the net greenhouse effect by more than 1/4 without sacrificing crop yields under P/T-3. Straw return (SR) minimized the negative impact on yields and the environment under P/T+3. Fertigation (FG) and Drought-Resistant (DR) varieties reduced the net greenhouse effect by more than 8.34% and maintained yields under 0.7P/T. SR was most beneficial to carbon sequestration, and yields were increased by 3.87% under 1.3P/T. Multiple adaptive strategies should be implemented to balance yields and reduce the environmental burden under future climate change.

AB Increasing use of manure nutrients in crop production and decreasing the input of chemical fertilizers, is a promising way to achieve a more circular economy and more sustainable food systems. The integrated effects of amended composting manure with additives and a 50% substitution of chemical fertilizer nitrogen (N) input by amended manure N input to cropland were proved to halve ammonia (NH3) emissions from an integrate manure-cropland system. However, the accompanied impacts of these measures on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the integrate manure-cropland system have not been well quantified. Here, we examined the effects of improved manure storage and treatment and its usage at field on GHG emissions from a system perspective, based on a two-year experiment in the North China Plain (NCP). Manure storage and treatment included natural storage (NS) and composting with straw, with or without amendment by zeolite (Z) and superphosphate (SP). Manure products were applied as basal fertilizer for both crops. Results showed that CH4 was the dominant GHG source in the natural storage treatment, whereas N2O dominated in the manure composting treatments. Amending manure with straw, Z and SP stimulated 15-48 times N2O emission and decreased CH4 emissions by 82%-91% during storage and treatment. Replacement of 50% synthetic fertilizer N by manure N decreased total system GHG emissions by 25%-34%. Differences between composted manure treatments in total system GHG emissions were relatively small, although comparatively higher in amended manure treatments; however, they promoted greater soil organic carbon sink activity, resulting in no significant difference in net global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI). Application of amended manure produced high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in the integrated crop-manure system. The NH3 mitigation approach of replacing 50% of synthetic fertilizer N by amended manure N synergistically decreased total GHG emissions, increased system NUE and also increased the net economic benefit by 5%-11% over the 2 years of the experiment.

AB Enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) while concurrently reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and without compromising yield is a contemporary challenge for many agricultural sectors across the globe. In China, resolving the "carbon-food" nexus is a key pillar of government policies aimed at constraining "Carbon Peak" and delivering "Carbon Neutrality". The present study explores the potential to increase SOC stocks while reducing GHGs emissions, without sacrificing crop yields considering crop rotation optimization under different irrigation managements in the North China Plain (NCP) based on a 6-year experiment. We found higher crop yields for the irrigated treatments compared with the rainfed treatments, demonstrating that rainfed crops were constrained by water deficit stress in the region. Yield was highest in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation (WM), followed by yields of the winter wheat-summer soybean (WS), while the average yields of winter wheat-summer maize -spring maize (WMMs) were lowest. SOC stocks in the surface soil (0-20 cm) increased for the irrigated treat-ments, but soil carbon sequestration (i.e. the rate of SOC stocks change over time) for the rainfed treatments decreased for all treatments. SOC stocks for WMMs was greatest of all treatments, leading to the highest carbon sustainability index (CSI) for this treatment. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 23-57% higher in the irrigated treatments than the rainfed treatments for the three rotations, which was highest in WMMs and lowest in WS. Carbon footprints (CFs) were highest in WS and lowest in WMMs. Overall, we found that increasing SOC stocks reduced CFs and increased yield. WMMs with irrigation was the most effective treatment for promoting SOC sequestration and mitigating GHG emissions with relatively high yield in this study, suggesting that crop rota-tions that are (1) more intensive and (2) grow more aboveground biomass are more likely to promulgate lower CFs and contribute towards national emissions abatement targets, such as those aimed at Net Zero.

AB Climate change caused by increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has led to frequent extreme weather events, which seriously threaten sustainable agricultural production. Therefore, it is essential to optimize proper irrigation management to improve the grain yield, crop water productivity (WPc), economic crop water productivity (EWPc), and lower global warming potential (GWP) and GWP Intensity (GWPI). The effect of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on GHG emissions remains largely unknown, even though this knowledge is essential to optimize the irrigation management. To address this knowledge gap, a field experiment was carried out in the North China Plain (NCP) for three winter wheat seasons to measure the influence of different irrigation methods and irrigation scheduling on WPc, EWPc, GWP, and GWPI. Irrigation scheduling including 50%, 60%, and 70% of the field capacity (FC) were kept in the main plots and irrigation methods, including sprinkler, drip, and flood irrigation methods in the sub-plots. The results revealed that relative to sprinkler irrigation at 60% FC, drip irrigation at 60% FC significantly (p < 0.05) improved the yield 4.89-7.52%, WPc 1.0-5.4%, EWPc 1.1-5.49%, lower GWP 7.47-9.34%, and GWPI 10.92-15.23%. Compared with flood irrigation at 60% FC, drip irrigation at 60% FC increased grain yield 5.34-6.81%, WPc 5.65-15.1%, EWPc 5.73-15.12%, lower GWP 10.36-15.16%, and GWPI 16.22-19.40%. Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) presented that compared with sprinkler and flood irrigation at 60% FC irrigation scheduling, drip irrigation at 60% FC irrigation scheduling provides the best results for improved the yield, WPc, and EWPc, and optimal balance in GWP and GWPI. Therefore, the irrigation scheduling of 60% FC combined with drip irrigation is suggested for sustained wheat yield, improved WPc and EWPc, and mitigated GWP in the NCP.

AB Context: Optimized irrigation management plays a pivotal role in wheat production in the North China Plain (NCP). However, there exists limited research on the potential impact of different irrigation regimes on the loss of reactive nitrogen (Nr) and the fate of nitrogen (N) within the wheat-soil system. Objective: Our study involved an irrigation experiment aimed at quantifying nitrogen-reducing (Nr) while tracing the N fate. Our primary objective was to glean insights into improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and reducing N surplus, thereby enhancing crop yields and minimizing environmental risks. Methods: A two-year field experiment involving winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted in the NCP, employing four distinct irrigation management strategies: I0, pre-planting irrigation; I1, pre-planting + jointing irrigation; I2, pre-planting + anthesis irrigation; I3, pre-planting + jointing + anthesis irrigation. Throughout the wheat growth stages, we measured soil NH3 and N2O emissions alongside yield assessments. The Nr loss, N surplus, NUE and Nr footprint were evaluated. Results: Among the components contributing to Nr loss, ammonia (NH3) volatilization was the most significant, accounting for 53.1-58.9%, followed by nitrate (NO3-) leaching (18.9-23.2%), indirect Nr loss (10.9-12.7%), nitric oxide (NO) emission (4.90-6.02%), nitrous oxide (N2O) emission (2.52-3.55%), and ammonium (NH4+) leaching (2.10-2.58%). NH3 emission and Nr loss demonstrated a close association with soil moisture levels influenced by irrigation management. Across all treatments, the primary fate of the N input was N uptake, representing 42.7-59.4%, and N surplus, accounting for 28.4-46.0%. Furthermore, NH3 volatilization, as the leading contributor to total N loss (11.4-12.9% of N input), accounted for 5.70-6.80% of N input. Compared to over-irrigation (I3), the I1 treatment, characterized by supplemental irrigation during the jointing stage, exhibited a remarkable 29.0% (P < 0.05) reduction in N surplus, achieved a higher NUE of 59.4%, and sustained wheat yield, thereby minimizing the Nr footprint. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage effectively mitigates Nr loss and shapes the N fate, resulting in both high NUE and increased wheat yields, while simultaneously reducing the Nr footprint.

AB Controlled-release urea (CRU) fertilizers are widely used in agricultural production to reduce conventional nitrogen (N) fertilization-induced agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and improve N use efficiency (NUE). However, the long-term effects of different CRU fertilizers on GHGs and crop yields in vegetable fields remain relatively unexplored. This study investigated the variations in GHG emissions at four growth stages of lettuce in the spring and autumn seasons based on a five-year field experiment in the North China Plain. Four treatments were setup: CK (without N application), U (conventional urea-N application), ON (20% reduction in urea-N application), CRU (20% reduction in polyurethane-coated urea without topdressing), and DCRU (20% reduction in polyurethane-coated urea containing dicyandiamide [DCD] without topdressing). The results show that N application treatments significantly increased the GHG emissions and the lettuce yield and net yield, and DCRU exhibited the lowest N2O and CO2 emissions, the highest lettuce yield and net yield, and the highest lettuce N content of the N application treatments. When compared to U, the N2O emission peak under CRU and DCRU treatments was notably decreased and delayed, and their average N2O emission fluxes were significantly reduced by 10.20-20.72% and 17.51-29.35%, respectively, leading to a significant reduction in mean cumulative N2O emissions during the 2017-2021 period. When compared to U, the CO2 fluxes of DCRU significantly decreased by 8.0-16.54% in the seedling period, and mean cumulative CO2 emission decreased by 9.28%. Moreover, compared to U, the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of the DCRU treatment was significantly alleviated by 9.02-17.13% and 16.68-20.36%, respectively. Compared to U, the N content of lettuce under DCRU was significantly increased by 6.48-17.25%, and the lettuce net yield was also significantly increased by 5.41-7.71%. These observations indicated that the simple and efficient N management strategy to strike a balance between enhancing lettuce yields and reduce GHG emissions in open-field lettuce fields could be obtained by applying controlled-release urea containing DCD without topdressing.

AB Agriculture causes 10-12% of global GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions. GHG emissions from Chinese agriculture have been estimated at 819.97 Mt CO2-equivalence (CO2-eq); among them, total annual GHG emissions from the production of grain and livestock have been estimated at 374 Mt CO2-eq and 445 Mt CO2-eq, respectively. Because of food demand, food production has intensified, resulting in the separation of crop production and livestock rearing. This separation has increased the application of outside resources and agricultural waste, aggravating GHG emissions and other ecological and environmental problems. This research attempts to mitigate GHG emissions by improving soil carbon sequestration of crop production and decreasing emissions from swine-rearing waste. Net GHG emissions (NGHGE) between an integrated system and a separated system are compared in this study from a life-cycle perspective. The causes of different GHG emissions between these two systems are analyzed and mitigation strategies are proposed. The results show that the NGHGE of crop-swine integrated and separated systems were 24,917.95 kg CO2-eq/ha/yr and 27,732.70 kg CO2-eq/ha/yr, respectively, for 215 head of pigs. The integrated system reduced GHG by 1381.33 kg CO2-eq/yr mainly due to the recycling and reuse of pig manure in croplands. Meanwhile, the integrated system increased soil carbon storage by 35.92% compared with the separated system, although it increased soil CH4 and N2O emissions. In conclusion, these results indicate that through a series of methods, such as recycling agricultural waste, the integrated system can reduce net GHG emissions by 10.15% compared with separated systems. Although much work remains to adopt the integrated system to reduce GHG emissions, the crop-swine integrated system should be given priority to mitigate anthropogenic net GHG emissions.

In the first experiment, conducted from 2010 to 2012, five fertilization strategies that included an unfertilized control plot, inorganic fertilizer-only plot, two plots with inorganic fertilizer plus composted cattle manure, and composted cattle manure-only plot were established. In the second experiment composted cattle manure was applied in autumn 2012 and the field was subdivided into three plots in spring 2013, with one plot receiving additional composted cattle manure, the second plot received additional inorganic fertilizer and the third plot did not receive any additional fertilization. Fluxes of N2O, CH4 and CO2 were measured using the static closed chamber method. NECB was calculated as carbon (C) inputs minus C output (where a negative value indicates net C loss). In experiment 1, manure application significantly increased NECB and reduced net GWP by more than 30% in each of the three years of the study. GHGI in the manure-amended plots was lower than in other plots, except in 2012 when the manure-only plot had higher GHGI than fertilizer-only plot. Application of inorganic fertilizer alone increased GWP by 5% and 20% in 2010 and 2011, but showed a 30% reduction in 2012 relative to the unfertilized control plot. However, due to higher net primary production (NPP), fertilizer-only plot had lower GHGI compared to the control. Application of inorganic fertilizer together with manure showed the greatest potential to reduce GWP and GHGI, while increasing NPP and NECB. In experiment 2, additional manure or inorganic fertilizer application in spring increased NPP by a similar amount, but additional manure application also increased NECB, and decreased GWP and GHGI. Manure application, as a partial substitute or supplemental fertilizer, shows potential to mitigate GWP and GHGI.

AB Context: Intercropping is widely practiced in many parts of the world due to its high resource-use efficiency, increased productivity, and numerous other agronomic benefits compared to monoculture. However, the interactions between intercropping and varied nitrogen (N) levels under long-term fertilization, particularly concerning soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water-use efficiency (WUE), are not well understood in the semi-arid North China Plain region. Objective: This study aimed to quantify the effects of maize-soybean intercropping and varying N levels under long-term N fertilization on soil GHG emissions, crop productivity, and WUE. Methods: A two-year field experiment was conducted using three cropping systems: maize monocrop, soybean monocrop, and maize-soybean intercrop, combined with four N levels: 0 (control, N0), 100 (N100), 150 (N150), and 200 (N200) kg N ha- 1 per growing season. All crops were managed using recommended practices. Results: Maize monocropping consistently emitted higher levels of N2O and CO2 than soybean monocropping and maize-soybean intercropping systems. Intercropping reduced cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions by 28 % and 15 %, respectively, compared to maize monocropping. Increasing N rates led to higher GHG emissions, with N200 treatment emitting 127 % and 71 % more N2O and 10.7 % and 4.1 % more CO2 than N100 and N150, respectively. Intercropped maize increased grain yield and above-ground biomass by 42 % and 21 % than monoculture maize in 2018 and by 39 % and 22 % in 2019, respectively. Although intercropped soybean yielded less biomass and grain, the total LER ranged from 1.11 to 1.37, suggesting that the overall productivity in intercropping was consistently higher than in monocropping. While nitrogen application significantly boosted biomass and grain yield, no difference was found between N150 and N200 treatments, suggesting that a higher N dose beyond N150 offered no additional benefit. Intercropping increased grain WUE by 47 % than maize monocropping. The water equivalent ratio (WER) ranged from 1.13 to 1.41, and the relative water-saving index ranged from -16.5 % to -28.8 %, suggesting that intercropping used water more efficiently, particularly at N150, where the highest WER for grain yield (1.41) and water savings (-28.8 %) were observed among the N rate treatments. Conclusion: Maize-soybean intercropping, combined with moderate N rate (150 kg N ha- 1), offers a sustainable approach to reducing GHG emissions, enhancing crop productivity, and improving water use efficiency in the semi-arid region of northern China.

AB Herbicide residues in farmland soils have attracted a great deal of attention in recent decades. Their accumulation potentially decreases the activity of microbes and related enzymes, as well as disturbs the nitrogen cycle in farmland soils. In previous studies, the influence of natural factors or nitrogen fertilization on the soil nitrogen cycle have frequently been examined, but the role of herbicides has been ignored. This study was conducted to examine the effects of herbicides on NH3 volatilization- and denitrification-related nitrogen loss through three rotation cycles from 2013 to 2016. The four treatments included no urea fertilizer (CK), urea (CN), urea+acetochlor-fenoxaprop-ethyl (AC-FE), and urea+2,4D-dicamba (2,4D-DI) approaches. The results showed that the application of nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased the nitrogen losses from ammonia volatilization and denitrification in the soil. Ammonia volatilization was the main reason for the gaseous loss of urea nitrogen in a wheat-maize rotation system in the North China Plain (NCP), which was significantly higher than the denitrification loss. In the CK treatment, the cumulative nitrogen losses from ammonia volatilization and denitrification during the three crop rotation cycles were 66.64 kg N hm-2 and 8.07 kg N hm-2, respectively. Compared with CK, the nitrogen losses from ammonia volatilization and denitrification under the CN treatment increased 52.62% and 152.88%, respectively. The application of AC-FE and 2,4D-DI significantly reduced the nitrogen gas losses from the ammonia volatilization and denitrification in the soil. Ammonia volatilization reduction mainly occurred during the maize season, and the inhibition rates of AC-FE and 2,4D-DI were 7.72% and 11.80%, respectively, when compared with CN. From the perspective of the entire wheat-maize rotation cycle, the inhibition rates were 5.41% and 7.23% over three years, respectively. Denitrification reduction also mainly occurred in the maize season, with the inhibition rates of AC-FE and 2,4D-DI being 34.12% and 30.94%, respectively, when compared with CN. From the perspective of the entire wheat-maize rotation cycle, the inhibition rates were 28.39% and 28.58% over three years, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates that herbicides could impact the nitrogen cycle of farmland soil ecosystems via the suppression of ammonia volatilization and denitrification rates, thus reducing gaseous N losses and mitigating global climate change.

AB Traditional methods of nitrogen fertilizer (urea) application are major causes of poor nitrogen use and serious greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which translates into global warming. Rational scheduling of nitrogen fertilization is critical for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions as well as ensuring sustainable food production. There is little information on the coupled analysis of global warming potential (GWP) and grain yield (GY) of winter wheat under a drip fertigation system. A two-year field experiment was conducted to determine the effect of split fertigation of nitrogen on GWP and yield of drip-irrigated winter wheat. The 5 levels of nitrogen schedule were as: N0-100 (all N fertilizer was applied as topdressing N), N25-75 (25% as basal N and 75% as topdressing N), N50-50 (50% as basal N and 50% as topdressing N), N75-25 (75% as basal N and 25% as topdressing N), and N100-0 (all N fertilizer was applied as basal and 0% topdressing N). The total nitrogen rate was 240 kg ha(-1). The basal N doses were spread just before sowing and the topdressing N doses were applied through a drip fertigation system. The results revealed that N schedule significantly (P < 0.05) affected GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions, GWP, GY, and subsequently the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). The lowest GWP (125.34 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1)) and GHGI (15.01 kg CO2 eq. Mg-1) were observed in N50-50 and N25-75 N scheduling, respectively. Compared with N100-0, the N scheduling of N25-75 and N50-50 significantly (P < 0.05) reduced GWP by 67.67 and 63.48%, respectively. A significantly higher yield (9.09 tons ha(-1)) was observed in the N50-50 treatment. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) specified that N50-50 N schedule provides the best results for minimized GWP at an acceptable GY. Therefore, the scheduling of 50% applied as basal N and other 50% as topdressing N through N-fertigation would be recommended for sustainable wheat production at a reduced risk of global warming in the North China Plain.

AB Soil microbial community plays crucial roles in promoting soil functions and maintaining soil health. Microbial functional gene abundances are actively involved in soil processes which supports soil functions and wider soil health. However, their suitability as indicators to assess soil health is still debatable. In this study, we sampled soils from a 10-year long-term fertilization experiment in a wheat-maize cropping system on the North China Plain. The treatment included no fertilizer (Control), chemical fertilizers only (NPK), NPK + organic manure, NPK + straw, and NPK + manure + straw. We quantified seventeen functional genes involved in carbon (cbbL, GH31), nitrogen (nifH, ureC, chiA, A-amoA, B-amoA, narG, nirK, nirS, norB and nosZ), and phosphorus (gltA, bpp, phoD, phoC, pqqC) cycling. These genes were correlated with a suite of soil properties representing indicators of carbon (total carbon, organic carbon, and permanganate oxidizable carbon, alpha-1,4 glucosidase and carbon dioxide emission), nitrogen (total nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and nitrous oxide emission), and phosphorous (available phosphorus, acid and alkaline phosphatase) pools/cycling. Soil microbial functional genes exhibited high coefficients of variation and strong sensitivity to fertilization treatments, while showing low variability among replicates within the same treatment. The abundances of functional genes, especially GH31, cbbL, B-amoA, chiA, phoC, and phoD were strongly correlated with their proxy indicators of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. In addition, organic fertilization enhanced carbon and nutrients relevant functional gene abundances, generating positive effects on maize yield. These results indicate that microbial functional genes are sensitive to organic inputs and could provide a more detailed and mechanistic understanding of soil processes than conventional indicators by capturing the biochemical processes that govern nutrient dynamics. Our study underscores the potential of microbial functional genes as sensitive and valuable indicators for advancing soil health assessments and management practices.

AB The effective mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from crop cultivation requires an overall consideration, due to the trade-off relationship between GHGs and the mitigation measures sometimes undermining grain yields and economic returns. To explore the maximum potential of GHG mitigation without sacrificing economic returns, we investigated the GHG emissions, crop yields and economic returns over two years in three rice-cropping systems (rice-wheat, RW; rice-fava bean, RB; and rice-fallow, RF). Different N fertilization levels and straw incorporation methods were employed in each of the rice-cropping systems at the study site, in the Taihu Lake region (TLR) of China. Bean straw produced in the RB system was fermented aerobically before incorporation, while straws produced in the RW and RF systems were directly incorporated into the soils. Relative to the traditional RW system, methane emissions during the rice seasons were significantly reduced by 29-44% in the RB system; annual N inputs were reduced by 43%; annual nitrous oxide emissions for N fertilization treatments were decreased by 56-69%; and the average rice yield was increased by 5.2%. As a, result, the GHG intensity (GHGI) was significantly reduced by 11-41%, and the annual net economic benefit (NEB) was increased by 22-94%. Compared with the RW system, the GHGI in the RF system was increased by 8-30% and the NEB was decreased by 3-33%. Considering the current rice/wheat production practices employed in the TLR, the GHGI could be reduced by 26% while the NEB could be improved by 23%, with an annual reduction in the N application rate (currently 525 kg N ha(-1)) by 20% and the conversion of the RW systems into RB systems that use straw fermentation. The results of this study suggest that high economic return and GHG mitigation could be simultaneously achieved by the integrated adoption of reasonable reduction in N application rates, the use of appropriate rice-cropping systems and by employing eco-friendly straw management.

AB Increasing scarcity of irrigation water is threatening global wheat production and sustainability. Accordingly, the water-saving irrigation regime has been strongly advocated to reduce irrigation water consumption. However, studies about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the winter wheat cropping system with water-saving irri-gation are rare. In this study, five irrigation regimes, wherein the supplementary irrigation brought soil water content in the 0-40 cm profile to 65% (K65) field water capacity (FC), 70% (K70) FC, 75% (K75) FC, 80% (K80) FC, and 85% (K85) FC at the joining and anthesis stages in 2019-2022. K75 improved the leaf area index at the grain-filling stage and dry matter remobilization pre-anthesis and dry matter assimilation post-anthesis. Corre-spondingly, 5.48-23.96% increases in grain yield were observed for K75 compared with K65, K70, and K85 treatments, mainly attributable to increased number of kernels and 1000-kernel weight. Compared with the K80 and K85 treatments, K75 treatment had the most prominent effect on the instability of soil carbon, nitrogen, and moisture content, as reflected in decreased cumulative emissions of soil N2O (5.15-15.65%) and CH4 (6.07-44.07%). It also decreased the global warming potential (6.17-19.53%). However, there were no signif-icant differences among K65, K70, and K75 treatments. In addition, the K75 treatment decreased greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) by 5.04-25.25% compared with K65, K70, K80 and K85 treatments. Collectively, based on the combined effects of grain yield and greenhouse gas emissions improvement, we recommend K75 as a sustainable irrigation regime that can improve grain yield and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Underground water source in North China Plain (NCP) is limited and extensively explored for wheat irrigation, which has caused high carbon emission. Reduced irrigation strategies and soil amendments have been advocated for sustainable agricultural production. However, the interactive effects of irrigation schedule and soil amendment on direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and carbon footprint (CF) have rarely been systematically quantified. A two-year field study was conducted in wheat season under three irrigation schedules (W0: pre-sowing irrigation only, W1: pre-sowing + jointing irrigation, and W2: pre-sowing + jointing + anthesis irrigation) and three fertilization types (Fc: chemical fertilizer only, Fm: chemical fertilizer + manure, and Fb: chemical fertilizer + biochar). In the Fc treatments, direct emissions from soil N2O and CH4 significantly decreased from W2 or W1 to W0, but SOC also decreased from W2 to W1 or W0. Net GHG emissions (GHGnet) was 14.6% higher in W1 +Fc but 6.0% lower in W0 +Fc compared with W2 +Fc because of the difference in electricity use for irrigation. Notably, the CF in W1 +Fc and W0 +Fc was 40.9% and 63.8% higher than in W2 +Fc mainly due to yield loss. Compared with Fc, direct emissions averaged 63.1% higher under Fm coupled with increased soil nitrate content, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN). The SOC significantly decreased from W0, W1 to W2 under Fm. Under the identical irrigation level, SOC stocks were 40.0% and 53.9% higher in Fm than in Fc under W1 and W0, while no significant difference under W2. Relative to Fc treatments, under Fm, CF was 28.5% lower in W0 but 6.2% and 45.7% higher in W1 and W2. Compared with Fc, direct emissions averaged 7.7% lower under Fb due to smaller MBN and higher soil porosity under Fb. The CF was lower in Fb than in Fc resulting from SOC increase. Thus, manure and biochar amendment could decrease CF following reduced irrigation, although manure application increased the risk of C loss.

AB Context: With the growing demand for food and the threat from climate change, increasing grain yields with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an important target. Yet, the quantitative effects of climate change and management practices on yield and global warming potential (GWP) of rice-winter wheat rotations are still uncertain.
   Objective: To investigate the key factors influencing the tradeoffs between yield and GHG of rice-winter wheat ecosystems in mid-eastern China over the two periods.
   Methods: In this study, the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was used to examine the spatiotemporal county-scale variations in yields of rice-winter wheat rotations and associated GHG (CH4, N2O) and GHG intensity (GHGI) over two periods (1980?1989, 2010?2019) in mid-eastern China. The DNDC model is driven by a county-scale database, consisting of meteorological data (79 stations), soil properties, management practice, and crop parameters for 213 counties. Eight scenarios were defined to isolate the individual and combined impacts of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices on yields, GWP, and GHGI.
   Results and conclusions: Results revealed that the total yield increased by 48.7% over the two periods but stagnated in the 2010s; the average emission rate of CH4 and N2O in the two periods were 250.7, 196, 0.63 and 2.83 kg ha- 1, respectively, while GWP and GHGI declined by 12.8% and 38.3%. The individual contributions of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices to the GHGI of the rice-winter wheat rotations were 37%, -42.5%, and 16.4%, respectively. Adoption of new cultivars was a decisive factor for improving yields and mitigating GHG, while climate change and management practices had a minor influence on yields. The negative responses of yield to improved management practices (i.e., high N fertilization, mid-season drainage) were mainly attributed to soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density variations and different fertilization patterns. The combination of new cultivars adoption and management practices decreased GHGI by 46.6%. These findings demonstrate the importance of high-yield crop varieties to low carbon agriculture, and that management practices should be adapted to local conditions and specific crop varieties.
   Significance: Given that the crop harvest index is approaching its theoretical upper limit and that promoting new varieties presents many challenges, future innovations should focus on introducing optimal strategies that balance the tradeoffs between yield and GHG emissions to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on agriculture.

AB Balanced fertilization strategies that combine the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers have been adopted to increase soil fertility and crop yield and to safeguard environment. However, knowledge on the influence of these fertilization strategies on microbe-mediated nitrogen cycling in the agricultural ecosystems remains limited. We analyzed the denitrifiers with nitrite reductase genes (nirK and nirS) in three soil aggregate classes (large macroaggregates, > 2 mm; small macroaggregates, 0.25-2 mm; and microaggregates, < 0.25 mm) in response to long-term application of inorganic fertilizers (NPK), NPK plus straw (NPKS), and NPK plus manure (NPKM) in the fluvo-aquic soil of North China Plain. Both fertilization and aggregate size had significant effects on the nirK and nirS gene abundances and soil potential denitrification activity (PDA). PDA in the combined fertilizer-treated soils (NPKS and NPKM treatments) was two times more than that in inorganic NPK-treated soil. PDA dramatically increased in small macroaggregates and microaggregates of NPKS treatment. The nirS gene abundance was significantly higher than that of the nirK gene abundance, and NPKS and NPKM treatments increased the nirS to nirK ratio in bulk soils and in microaggregates compared with NPK treatment and control. Correlation analysis and automatic linear modeling revealed a primary correlation between PDA and abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers. Soil properties, such as SOC, pH and TN, significantly affected the community structure of nirK- and nirS-type denitrifiers while only aggregate size significantly influenced the composition of nirK-type denitrifiers. Taken together, our results suggest that long-term combined fertilization increased the denitrification potential in small macroaggregate and microaggregate classes, and the increased gene abundance and the shift community structures of nirS- and nirK-type denitrifiers were potentially responsible for an increase in the promoted denitrification.

AB Urease inhibitor (UI) and nitrification inhibitor (NI) can reduce N losses from agricultural soils but effects of inhibitors on N cycle are unclear. A field experiment was conducted with maize to test effects of UI (N-(n-Butyl) thiophosphoric, NBPT) and NI (3,4-dimethylepyrazolephosphate, DMPP) on N uptake and N-cycling soil microbes. Five treatments were imposed: no N fertilizer input (CK), conventional fertilization (CF) and 80% of urea input with NBPT (80%U+UI), with DMPP (80%U+NI) and with half NBPT and half DMPP (80%U+1/2(UI+NI)). There were no significant differences in biomass between 80%U+UI, 80%U+NI and CF but harvest index was increased under 80%U+UI and 80%U+NI. Compared to CF, N use efficiency of grain under 80%U+UI was increased by 7.1%, whereas grain yield and N uptake under 80%U+1/2(UI+NI) were decreased by 8.2% and 9.4%, respectively. The peak soil NO3--N content was at about 15 days after fertilization (DAF) under CF but 30 DAF under the inhibitor treatments. In soils of 80%U+UI, the activities of urease and nitrate reductase were decreased between 15-45 DAF and between 5-30 DAF. The abundance of N-cycling soil microbes was affected: 80%U+UI and 80%U+NI reduced the copies of the amoA AOA and nir genes at about 15 days and reduced the copies of the amoA AOB gene at about 30 days. Correlation analysis indicated that there were significant positive relationships between amoA AOB gene and NH4+-N, as well as between nirK gene and NO3--N. Overall, urea applied with NBPT has greater potential for improving maize N use efficiency and inhibiting nitrification under reduced fertilizer-N applications.

AB Purpose The application of a large amount of inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer resulted in an increasing N loss. It is an effective practice that biochar and organic fertilizer replace part of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer. Thus, it is necessary to identify and compare the effects of biochar and organic fertilizer on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) community structure in saline-alkali soil.
   Materials and methods Three treatments in triplicate were included in the field experiment: (1) CK (no biochar and organic fertilizer), (2) biochar at 10.0 t ha(-1) year(-1) (C), and (3) organic fertilizer at 7.5 t ha(-1) year(-1) (M). The community structures and diversities of AOB and AOA were investigated by Illumina sequencing analysis of gene encoding ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) and followed by principal component analysis, least discriminant analysis effect size, and redundancy analysis.
   Results and discussion Biochar and organic fertilizers did not change the diversity of AOA and reduced the relative abundance of Candidatus-Nitrosoarchaeum in maize season, while only biochar increased the relative abundance of Candidatus-Nitrosotenuis in wheat season. The diversity of AOB was significantly reduced in the M treatment, but was not changed in the C treatment in wheat season. Moreover, the relative abundances of Nitrosomonas (CK, 15.1%; C, 6.8%; M, 3.4%) were decreased in the maize season, and the relative abundances of Nitrosovibrio (CK, 9.8%; C, 16.8%; M, 14.5%) were increased in the wheat season in the C and M treatments, which probably related to the changes in soil pH, soil NH4+-N content, and soil salt content (SSC). The lower soil pH, higher NO3--N content, and SSC resulted in Nitrosospira (maize season: CK, 42.2%; C, 40.7%; M, 62.0%; wheat season: CK, 46.6%; C, 50.7%; M, 65.4%) becoming the dominant genus in the M treatment.
   Conclusions Our results indicated that AOB was more susceptible than AOA to biochar and organic fertilizer. Organic fertilizer has significant effects on the diversities and community structure of AOB than biochar associated with the changing in soil pH, salinity, and mineral N.

AB Excessive agricultural inputs meet food demand only at a huge environmental cost, and optimized management strategies are needed to promote the balanced development of food security, water conservation, and environ-mental sustainability. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment to investigate annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, yield, water use efficiency (WUE), global warming potential (GWP), and greenhouse gas in-tensity (GHGI) from 2016 to 2018 in a typical wheat?maize cropping system in the North China Plain. Two tillage methods (T1, rotary tillage; T2, subsoiling) and four irrigation schedules (W1, pre-planting irrigation; W2, pre-planting + jointing irrigation; W3, pre-planting + anthesis irrigation; W4, pre-planting + jointing + anthesis irrigation) were used for winter wheat, and conventional practices were adopted for summer maize. In the winter wheat?summer maize season, the soil acted as a net sink for CH4 but as a source for CO2 and N2O in all treat-ments, and CO2 accounted for the highest proportion of the GWP. The inappropriate irrigation period in the W3 treatment caused greater GHG release and reduced crop yield, whereas the excessive irrigation in the W4 treatment led to low water productivity. Although the use of irrigation water increased annual GHG emissions, an appropriate irrigation schedule could significantly mitigate the GHGI. Compared with the W3 and W4 treatments, the W2 treatment increased yield by an average of 7.56-10.58% and 2.06-2.68%, improved WUE by 9.95-17.83% and 11.29-22.84%, reduced GWP by 3.70?5.10% and 0.65-2.25%, and decreased GHGI by 10.66-14.26% and 3.05-4.86%, respectively. The T2 treatment resulted in high GHG emissions and was accompanied by low yield and water productivity. Relative to the T2 treatment, the annual yield and WUE in the T1 treatment increased by an average of 4.41-15.15% and 8.12-12.76%, and the annual GWP and GHGI decreased by 3.97-4.62% and 8.80-16.93%. Therefore, rotary tillage combined with supplementary irrigation at the jointing stage can mitigate GHG emissions and improve yield and water productivity, making it an envi-ronmentally friendly agricultural practice.
