AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) emissions from an agricultural field in the North China Plain were compared for three treatments during a whole maize growing period from 26 June to 11 October, 2012. Compared with the control treatment (without fertilization, designated as CK), remarkable pulse emissions of N2O, NO and NH3 were observed from the normal fertilization treatment (designated as NP) just after fertilization, whereas only N2O and NH3 pulse emissions were evident from the nitrification inhibitor treatment (designated as ND). The reduction proportions of N2O and NO emissions from the ND treatment compared to those from the NP treatment during the whole maize growing period were 31% and 100%, respectively. A measurable increase of NH3 emission from the ND treatment was found with a cumulative NH3 emission of 3.8 +/- 1.2 kg N/ha, which was 1.4 times greater than that from the NP treatment (2.7 +/- 0.7 kg N/ha).

AB Nitrogen amendment followed by flooding irrigation is a general management practice fora wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain, which may favor nitrification and denitrification. Consequently, high emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are hypothesized to occur. To test this hypothesis, we performed year-round field measurements of N2O and NO fluxes from irrigated wheat-maize fields on a calcareous soil applied with all crop residues using a static, opaque chamber measuring system. To interpret the field data, laboratory experiments using intact soil cores with added carbon (glucose) and nitrogen (nitrate, ammonium) substrates were performed. Our field measurements showed that pulse emissions after fertilization and irrigation/rainfall contributed to 73% and 88% of the annual N2O and NO emissions, respectively. Soil moisture and mineral nitrogen contents significantly affected the emissions of both gases. Annual emissions from fields fertilized at the conventional rate (600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) totaled 4.0 +/- 0.2 and 3.0 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for N2O and NO, respectively, while those from unfertilized fields were much lower (0.5 +/- 0.02 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.4 +/- 0.05 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Direct emission factors (EF(d)s) of N2O and NO for the fertilizer nitrogen were estimated to be 0.59 +/- 0.04% and 0.44 +/- 0.04%, respectively. By summarizing the results of our study and others, we recommended specific EF(d)s (N2O: 0.54 +/- 0.09%; NO: 0.45 +/- 0.04%) for estimating emissions from irrigated croplands on calcareous soils with organic carbon ranging from 5 to 16 g kg(-1). Nitrification dominated the processes driving the emissions of both gases following fertilization. It was evident that insufficient available carbon limited microbial denitrification and thus N2O emission. This implicates that efforts to enhance carbon sink in calcareous soils likely increase their N2O emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This experiment was conducted in maize field plots to study the effects of N-fertilizer management on nitrogen oxide emissions, soil microbial activities and crop yield, and the relationships among them in a Japanese Andisol. N fertilization increased both nitrification and dehydrogenase activities in soil and the emissions of NO and NO. Nitrification and dehydrogenase activities showed a close relationship with the NO emission, while the relationship with the N2O emission was not significant. Deep application (8 cm) of N fertilizer generally decreased both nitrification activity and NO emission. Controlled release of N fertilizer decreased the dehydrogenase activity and up to 86% of the NO emission. Our findings indicate the possibility that the low biological NO production in soil by deep application and controlled release of N fertilizer contributed to the low NO emission. Application of controlled release N fertilizer significantly increased the grain yield and N uptake by grain. NO emission showed a negative relationship with maize yield as affected by N-fertilizer management, suggesting the possibility of mitigating NO emission from Andisols without reducing crop production.

AB Conventional nitrogen fertilization in a maize cropping system enhances the soil's methane (CH4) sink but exacerbates emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). This study demonstrates that conventional nitrogen application (UN) increased CH4 uptake by 154%, while elevating N2O and NO emissions by 190% and 301%, respectively, compared to zero nitrogen plots (N0). Fertilization fundamentally reconfigured the regulatory mechanisms governing gas fluxes: under UN, fluxes were controlled by a complex interplay of nitrogen substrates, carbon availability, moisture, and temperature, whereas under N0, CH4 uptake exhibited significantly enhanced temperature sensitivity (with Q10 increasing from 1.06 to 7.54) and nitrogen oxide emissions became more dependent on native ammonium and extractable organic carbon. Crucially, nitrogen withdrawal reduced soil ammonium by 37.1% without altering non-nitrogen soil properties, including temperature, moisture, and labile carbon pools. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the concept of nitrogen saturation under conventional fertilization rates. Optimizing these rates presents a significant opportunity to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution while improving nitrogen use efficiency, thereby aligning agricultural production with climate goals and public health objectives without destabilizing short-term soil function.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is an important component of biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen, produced via biologically mediated processes of nitrification and denitrification in soils. The production and consumption processes of NO in black soils are not fully understood. We established how moisture and temperature affect NO dynamics for black soil samples of maize land in the temperate zone of northeastern China. The optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO production and emission was determined to be 41% water-filled pore space (WFPS), based on laboratory experiments and modeling. For a given moisture, NO fluxes increased exponentially with soil temperature at any given soil moisture. The optimum soil moisture for the maximum NO emission was constant and independent of soil temperature. The NO consumption rate constant (k) in the studied soil (range 9.31 x 10(-6)-15.1 x 10(-6) m(3) kg(-1) s(-1)) was in the middle of the range of similar k values published to date. The maximum NO emission potential for black soils at 25 degrees C and 15 degrees C were about 18.6 and 9.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Based on laboratory results and field monitoring data of soil water content and soil temperature, the average NO fluxes from black soils in the region were estimated to be 10.7 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for an entire plant growth period. NO emissions likely occur principally in July, associated with optimum soil moisture. The present study suggests that NO fluxes from black soil are much lower than the previous reports from cropland in southern parts of China. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   PRACTICES
AB Although numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of no-tillage on carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural systems, there is still no consensus on the balance between the potential of C sequestration and nitrous oxide (N2O) or nitric oxide (NO) emissions. A no-tillage field experiment in the North China Plain was established in 2006 and the influence of no-tillage on N2O and NO emissions was monitored under an annual wheat-maize cropping system. The study included four treatments: no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) soils amended with N fertilizer at a rate of 225 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and 195 kg N ha(-1) for maize (NTN and CTN) and without N fertilizer (NT0 and CT0). Three years of no-tillage significantly (p < 0.05) increased soil organic C (SOC) content by 12.2% in the 0-5 cm soil layer, possibly due to the surface aggregation of organic C derived from crop roots and exudates, but did not alter SOC pool in the 0-30 an profile. Annual N2O emissions in the NT0 and CT0 treatments were 0.53 and 0.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively, and were significantly (p < 0.05) increased to 0.96 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in CTN and to 1.23 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in NTN. Remarkable differences in N20 emissions between CTN and NTN were observed during the maize growing season. In contrast, NO emissions were not affected by the tillage regimes regardless of N fertilization. The mean ratios of NO/N2O fluxes in N-unfertilized plots were 0.26-0.29 and 1.79-2.11 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, indicating that both NO and N2O were primarily derived from denitrification during the maize growing season and from nitrification under wheat cultivation. Under N-fertilized plots, the ratios increased to 1.44-2.02 and 5.00-6.03 for the maize and wheat season, respectively, with significantly (p < 0.05) lower values in NTN plots than in CTN plots. The N2O emission factors for N applied in the wheat-maize rotation system were 0.16% and 0.09% for NTN and CTN, respectively, which was far lower than the IPCC Tier 1 default value (1.0%), primarily due to the absence of irrigation after fertilization in maize season and low temperature in wheat season. The results suggest that the 3-year no-tillage regime with residue removal did not substantially increase C storage in the 0-30 cm profile, but stimulated N2O emissions primarily by increasing denitrification.

AB Arable soils are a significant source of nitric oxide (NO), most of which is derived from nitrogen fertilizers. Accurate estimates of NO emissions from these soils are essential to devise strategies to mitigate the impact of agriculture on tropospheric ozone production and destruction. This paper presents the implementation of a soil NO emissions submodel within the environmentally-orientated soil-crop model, CERES-EGC. The submodel simulates NO production via the nitrification pathway, as modulated by soil environmental drivers. The resulting model was tested with data from 4 field experiments on wheat- and maize-cropped soils representative of two agricultural regions of France, over three years, and encompassing various climatic conditions. Overall, the model provided accurate predictions of NO emissions, but shortcomings arose from an inadequate vertical distribution of N fertilizer in the soil surface. Inclusion of a 2-cm thick topsoil layer in a 'micro-layer' version of CERES-EGC gave more realistic simulations of NO emissions and under-lying microbiological process. From a statistical point of view, both versions of the model achieved a similar fit to the experimental data, with respectively a MD and a RMSE ranging from 1.8 to 6.2 g N-NO ha(-1)d(-1), and from 22.8 to 25.2 g N-NO ha(-1)d(-1) across the 4 experiments. The cumulative NO losses represented 1-2% of NH4+ fertilizer applied in the case of maize crops, and about 1% in the case of wheat crops. The 'micro-layer' version may be used for spatialized inventories of NO emissions to improve air quality prediction.

AB Balancing food security with fertilizer-driven climate impacts remains critical in intensive agriculture. While organic-inorganic substitution enhances soil fertility, its effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions remain uncertain. This study evaluated N2O/NO emissions, crop yields, and agronomic parameters in a subtropical wheat-maize rotation under four fertilization regimes: inorganic-only (NPK), manure-only (OM), and partial substitution with crop residues (CRNPK, 15%) or manure (OMNPK, 30%), all applied at 280 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Emissions aligned with the dual Arrhenius-Michaelis-Menten kinetics and revised "hole-in-the-pipe" model. Annual direct emission factors (EFd) for N2O and NO were 1.01% and 0.11%, respectively, with combined emissions (1.12%) exponentially correlated to soil nitrogen surplus (p < 0.01). CRNPK and OMNPK reduced annual N2O+NO emissions by 15-154% and enhanced NUE by 10-45% compared with OM, though OMNPK emitted 1.7-2.0 times more N2O/NO than CRNPK. Sole OM underperformed in yield, while partial substitution-particularly with crop residues-optimized productivity while minimizing environmental risks. By integrating emission modeling and agronomic performance, this study establishes CRNPK as a novel strategy for subtropical cereal systems, reconciling high yields with low greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Fertilized agricultural soils are a significant source of NO, a gas involved in tropospheric ozone formation. The aims of the research reported here were to measure NO fluxes over the length of the growing season of wheat and maize crops, and to build a model of soil NO emissions from arable land. Field experiments were carried out on a 1-ha field divided into two parts. The first one was cropped with wheat and harvested in late July, 2002, whereas the second part was sown with maize and harvested in October. The wheat and maize received 130 kg N ha(-1) and 140 kg N ha(-1), respectively. For each crop, NO fluxes were measured during 10 months every 2 weeks using manual closed chambers, and continuously with a wind tunnel immediately after nitrogen fertilization. Fertilizer application significantly affected NO emissions: the largest NO emissions were recorded a few days after nitrogen application. This delay depended on the kinetics of nitrogen incorporation in the soil, as influenced by rainfall. The emissions measured on the maize field (2.6% of the fertilizer amount applied) were more important than those on the wheat field (1.0% of the fertilizer amount applied), owing to differences in timing of nitrogen application, with respect to climate and crop growth. Relationships between soil nitrification rate and NO emission obtained from laboratory incubations, and experimental data appeared useful and relevant to predict NO emissions at the field-scale.

AB Straw return in combination with synthetic N fertilizer is considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield. Such practice, however, can considerably modify soil microbial activity and relative C and N availability, both of which are known to regulate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Minimizing these emissions per unit of crop yield is a prerequisite to minimize the environmental footprint of agricultural production and thus, a policy objective. In our study, we quantified N2O and NO emissions and determined fertilizer-N use efficiencies (NUE) and crop yields of two double-cropping (summer maize/Welsh onion-winter wheat) systems with and without straw incorporation in the North China Plain. Relative to the fertilized treatment without straw amendments, straw incorporation showed a significant inhibitory effect on annual N2O emissions from the maize-wheat system (-31%), but no significant effect was observed for the Welsh onion-wheat system. However, straw return significantly reduced annual NO emissions by >30% for both systems. Meanwhile, straw return in both systems significantly increased the NUE and crop yields by 34-47% and 7-16%, respectively, as compared to the treatment without straw additions. Across the double-cropping systems, annual direct emission factors of N2O, NO and N2O + NO were 0.37-0.57%, 0.08-0.78% and 0.57-1.36%, respectively. Furthermore, a negative relationship between direct emission factors of N2O + NO and crop NUE was observed, highlighting the importance of optimizing NUE for reducing environmental risks of a cropping system. When expressing emissions on a yield basis, straw return significantly reduced annual yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions by 15-42% for both systems. Overall, our results show that the combined application of crop straw and synthetic N fertilizer is a promising N management strategy for maximizing crop yields while mitigating N-trace gas emissions.

AB During October to December 1994, we measured diel and seasonal variability in nitric oxide (NO) exchange by a southern African savanna ecosystem (Grasslands Research Station, Marondera, Zimbabwe). A set of automated dynamic chambers was installed in three sub-sites: Miombo forest, natural grassland, and cropped soils (maize, sorghum, groundnut). The latter received a single application of commercialy available in-organic or cowdung fertilizer. The dynamic chamber system is described in detail, including correction of the resulting data for wall losses and gas-phase reactions of the NO-NO2-O-3 triad. During the dry season, net vertical NO fluxes were close to the detection limit (0.44 ngN m(-2)s(-1)) regardless of vegetation type. During the transition from dry to wet season strong ''pulsing'' effects of the NO flux were observed: NO emissions increased by a factor of up to 60 within hours. During the wet season, NO emissions varied between the different sub-sites of the ecosystem; corresponding means are in ranking order of fertilized agricultural plots (27.2 ngN m(-2) s(-1)), unfertilized agricultural plots (8.5 ngN m(-2) s(-1)), grassland (4.4 ngN m(-2) s(-1)), and Miombo forest (1.5 ngN m(-2) s(-1)). Soil moisture was found to be the dominant factor controlling the NO fluxes. Whenever it was not limiting, the diel behaviour of NO emission followed the daily variation of soil temperature measured 1 cm below the surface.

AB The intensification of agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is necessary to reduce poverty and improve food security, but increased nutrient applications in smallholder systems could have negative consequences for water quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and air quality. We tracked nitrogen (N) inputs and measured maize (Zea mays) biomass, grain yields, N leaching, and nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide fluxes from a clayey soil in Yala, Kenya and a sandy soil in Tumbi, Tanzania, with application rates of 0, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) over two cropping seasons. Maize yields were 4.5 times higher in Yala than Tumbi, but yields plateaued at both sites with fertilizer applications at or above 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Partial N budgets in Yala were typically negative, meaning more N was exported in maize biomass plus grain or lost from the system than was added in fertilizer. In Tumbi, N budgets were negative at lower fertilizer levels but positive at higher fertilizer levels. At both sites most (96%) of the N was lost through maize biomass/grain removal and N leaching. Fertilizer additions at or less than 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) on these two contrasting sites resulted in minor gaseous N losses, and fertilizer additions less than 200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) caused relatively little change to N leaching losses. This indicates that the modest increases in fertilizer use required to improve maize yields will not greatly increase cropland N losses.

Application of crop residues and/or manures as amendments is a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to overcome this problem. However, these management practices may induce important changes in the nitrogen oxide emissions from these agroecosystems, with additional impacts on carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, a field experiment was carried out with a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) crop under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effect of combining maize (Zea mays L.) residues and N fertilizer inputs (organic and/or mineral) on these emissions.
   Crop yield and N uptake, soil mineral N concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), denitrification capacity, N2O, NO and CO2 fluxes were measured during the growing season.
   The incorporation of maize stover increased N2O emissions during the experimental period by c. 105 %. Conversely, NO emissions were significantly reduced in the plots amended with crop residues. The partial substitution of urea by pig slurry reduced net N2O emissions by 46 and 39 %, with and without the incorporation of crop residues respectively. Net emissions of NO were reduced 38 and 17 % for the same treatments. Molar DOC:NO (3) (-) ratio was found to be a robust predictor of N2O and NO fluxes.
   The main effect of the interaction between crop residue and N fertilizer application occurred in the medium term (4-6 month after application), enhancing N2O emissions and decreasing NO emissions as consequence of residue incorporation. The substitution of urea by pig slurry can be considered a good management strategy since N2O and NO emissions were reduced by the use of the organic residue.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) plays a critical role in atmospheric chemistry and also is a precursor of nitrate, which affects particle matter formation and nitrogen deposition. Agricultural soil has been recognized as a main source of atmospheric NO. However, quantifying the NO fluxes emitted from croplands remains a challenge and in situ long-term measurements of NO are still limited. In this study, we used an automated sampling system to measure NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over two years (April 2017 to March 2019) from a rainfed maize field in the Northeast China. The cumulative annual NO emissions were 8.9 and 2.3 kg N ha-1 in year 1 (April 2017 to March 2018) and year 2 (April 2018 to March 2019), respectively. These interannual differences were largely related to different weather conditions encountered. In year 1, a month-long drought before and after the seeding and fertilizing reduced plant N uptake and dramatically increased soil N concentration. The following moderate rainfalls promoted large amount of NO emissions, which remained high until late September. The NO fluxes in both years showed clearer seasonal patterns, being highest after fertilizer application in summer, and lowest in winter. The seasonal patterns of NO fluxes were mainly controlled by soil available N concentrations and soil temperatures. The contribution of NO fluxes during the spring freeze-thaw in both years was no more than 0.2% of the annual NO budget, indicating that the freeze-thaw effect on agricultural NO emissions was minimal. In addition, with high-resolution monitoring, we found that soil not only act as a NO source but also a sink. Longterm and high-resolution measurements help us better understand the diurnal, seasonal, and annual dynamics of NO emissions, build more accurate models and better estimate global NO budget and develop more effective policy responses to global climate change.

AB Maize (Zea mays L.), a staple crop in the North China Plain, contributing substantially to agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in this region. Many studies have focused on various agricultural management measures to reduce N2O emissions. However, few have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems. In the current study, we investigate whether maize-soybean intercropping treatments could reduce N2O emission rates. Two differently configured maize-soybean intercropping treatments, 2:2 intercropping (two rows of maize and two rows of soybean, 2M2S) and 2:1 intercropping (two rows of maize and one row of soybean, 2M1S), and monocultured maize (M) and soybean (S) treatments were performed using a static chamber method. The results showed no distinct yield advantage for the intercropping systems. The total N2O production from the various treatments was 0.15 +/- 0.04-113.85 +/- 12.75 mu g m(-2) min(-1). The cumulative N2O emission from the M treatment was 16.9 +/- 2.3 kg ha(-1) over the entire growing season (three and a half months), which was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the 2M2S and 2M1S treatments by 36.6% and 32.2%, respectively. Two applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (as urea) at 240 kg N ha(-1) each induced considerable soil N2O fluxes. Short-term N2O emissions (within one week after each of the two N applications) accounted for 74.4%-83.3% of the total emissions. Soil moisture, temperature, and inorganic N were significantly correlated with soil N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.246-0.365, n = 192, P < 0.001). Soil nitrate (NO3-) and moisture decreased in the intercropping treatments during the growing season. These results indicate that maize-soybean intercropping can reduce soil N-2O emissions relative to monocultured maize.

AB Agricultural soil has been recognized as a major source of atmospheric NO and N2O emissions which have important impacts on regional and global environments. Here we comparably investigated the effects of ammonium, nitrate fertilizers and nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) addition on NO and N2O emissions from the agricultural soil in the North China Plain (NCP). Compared with the ammonium fertilizer application, the reductions of NO emissions caused by nitrate fertilizer and DCD addition were 100% and 93%, and of N2O emissions were 54% and 74%, respectively. Remarkable reductions of NO and N2O emissions were also observed from five different agricultural soils in the NCP by replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer, indicating that nitrification is the predominant process for the emissions of NO and N2O from the soils in the vast area of NCP. NO emission peaks were found to be several days later than N2O peaks after the application of ammonium fertilizer and flooding irrigation, implying that most of NO initially produced via nitrification process might be fast reduced to N2O under the high soil moisture condition. Interestingly, the relative contribution of denitrification to N2O emission showed obviously time-dependent, e.g., evident N2O emission caused by the application of nitrate was only observed after the basal fertilization for the maize and the top dressing for the wheat. Replacing ammonium with nitrate fertilizer and mixing with the nitrification inhibitor are verified to be effective measures for mitigating NO and N2O emissions from arable soils in the NCP.

AB A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the combined or individual effects of biochar and nitrapyrin (a nitrification inhibitor) on N2O and NO emissions from a sandy loam soil cropped to maize. The study included nine treatments: addition of urea alone or combined with nitrapyrin to soils that had been amended with biochar at 0, 3, 6, and 12 t ha(-1) in the preceding year, and a control without the addition of N fertilizer. Peaks in N2O and NO flux occurred simultaneously following fertilizer application and intense rainfall events, and the peak of NO flux was much higher than that of N2O following application of basal fertilizer. Mean emission ratios of NO/N2O ranged from 1.11 to 1.72, suggesting that N2O was primarily derived from nitrification. Cumulative N2O and NO emissions were 1.00 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 1.39 kg NO-N ha(-1) in the N treatment, respectively, decreasing to 0.81-0.85 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 1.31-1.35 kg NO-N ha(-1) in the biochar amended soils, respectively, while there was no significant difference among the treatments. NO emissions were significantly lower in the nitrapyrin treatments than in the N fertilization-alone treatments (P < 0.05), but there was no effect on N2O emissions. Neither biochar nor nitrapyrin amendment affected maize yield or N uptake. Overall, our results showed that biochar amendment in the preceding year had little effect on N2O and NO emissions in the following year, while the nitrapyrin decreased NO, but not N2O emissions, probably due to suppression of denitrification caused by the low soil moisture content.

AB There is a high spatial variation in N2O emission from agricultural fields and N2O emissions from fields cultivated with stalk-crops was generally measured in the interrow area. The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in seasonal N2O emissions between interrow soil and interrow + row soil, and to understand the effect of different fertilizers on N2O emissions in a maize-cultivated sandy loam soil in the North China Plain. The experiment included five treatments: organic manure (OM), half-organic manure N plus half fertilizer N (HOM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NK (NK) and control (CK). Cumulative N2O emission from interrow + row soil during the maize growth season was 0.84-122 kg N ha(-1) with an average of 0.98 kg N ha(-1) in the N-fertilized treatments, significantly higher than the 0.30-0.49 kg N ha(-1) from interrow soil. However, no significant difference was observed in the CK treatment. The measurement in interrow soil underestimated N2O emissions by 44-67%. This difference mainly occurred at the two peak emission periods following fertilizer application probably due to discrepancy in soil denitrification potential. Manure application more efficiently increased difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil than inorganic N fertilizer application. The higher NO concentration did not induce larger N2O emission from interrow soil in the NK treatment than in the NPK treatment, but did from interrow + row soil, resulting in greater difference in N2O emission between interrow soil and interrow + row soil. It is suggested that measuring N2O emission solely from interrow soil could underestimate seasonal N2O emissions, and partly mask the effect of N fertilizer application rates on N2O emission in a maize-cultivated soil in the North China Plain.

AB The DNDC, LandscapeDNDC and IAP-N-GAS models have been designed to simulate the carbon and nitrogen processes of terrestrial ecosystems. Until now, a comparison of these models using simultaneous observations has not been reported, although such a comparison is essential for further model development and application. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the models, delineate the strengths and limitations of each model for simulating soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, and explore short-comings of these models that may require reconsideration. We conducted comparisons among the models using simultaneous observations of both gases and relevant variables from the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system at three field sites with calcareous soils. Simulations of N2O and NO emissions by the three models agreed well with annual observations, but not with daily observations. All models failed to correctly simulate soil moisture, which could explain some of the incorrect daily fluxes of N2O and NO, especially for intensive fluxes during the growing season. Multi-model ensembles are promising approaches to better simulate daily gas emissions. IAP-N-GAS underestimated the priming effect of straw incorporation on N2O and NO emissions, but better results were obtained with DNDC95 and LandscapeDNDC. LandscapeDNDC and IAP-N-GAS need to improve the simulation of irrigation water allocation and residue decomposition processes, respectively, and together to distinguish different irrigation methods as DNDC95 does. All three models overestimated the emissions of the nitrogenous gases for high nitrogen fertilizer (>430 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) addition treatments, and therefore, future research should focus more on the simulation of the limitation of soil dissolvable organic carbon on denitrification in calcareous soils.

AB Given the common problem of fertilizer overuse, agronomists are calling for a reduction of the high nitrogen dose by 1/3. We carried out a field experiment over two full winter wheat-summer maize rotations in the North China Plain (NCP) to determine whether this degree of nitrogen reduction will significantly reduce the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). Three treatments were investigated in the field trial: a control with no nitrogen application, the conventional practice with nitrogen over-application and the optimal practice with a reduced dose of nitrogen by 1/3. Our observations across all treatments over the experimental period reveal significant correlations of the fluxes of either gas with soil temperature and moisture as well as the concentrations of soil ammonium, nitrate and dissolvable organic carbon. There were strong correlations within the functions of the dual Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving apparent activation energy values of 40-97 and 59-92 kJ mol(-1) for N2O and NO fluxes, respectively. Our results provide annual direct emission factors of 0.48-0.96% for N2O and 0.15-0.47% for NO and demonstrate a significant correlation between N2O emission induced by fertilization and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The correlation indicates a significant potential of N2O mitigation via enhancing NUEs. A reduction in the nitrogen dose did not obviously mitigate either the annual NO emission in both rotations or the annual N2O emission in the second one. However, nitrogen reduction significantly decreased the annual total N2O emission by 38% during the first rotation. These inconsistencies in the responses of N2O emission to the reduced nitrogen dose can be attributed to improper fertilization practices, such as broadcasting urea prior to heavy rainfalls or irrigation events during the maize season, which implies a need for further fertilization practice options/techniques in addition to the reduction of nitrogen doses.

AB Dairy effluents instead of mineral fertilizer can realize nutrients recycling while urease inhibitors have been proposed as fertilizer amendments to maximize nutrients utilization and reduce negative environmental effects. However, studies on the impacts of dairy effluent combined with urease inhibitors on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions remain limited. Here, a 2-year field trail with maize was conducted in a sandy soil with four treatments: no nitrogen (N) fertilizer (Control), mineral N fertilizer urea (NPK), fermented dairy effluent as liquid fertilizer (LF), and LF plus urease inhibitor hydroquinone (LFHQ). Cumulative N2O emission in the NPK treatment was 0.44 kg N ha-1 during the 2021 maize season while drastically increased to 5.21 kg N ha-1 during the 2022 maize season with extreme precipitation occurred, while NO emission reduced from 0.65 to 0.17 kg N ha-1. Compared with the NPK treatment, N2O and NO emissions in the LF treatment decreased by 38.6% and 29.2%, and by 38.8% and 6.4% during the 2021 and 2022 maize seasons, respectively. Compared with the LF treatment, the LFHQ treatment increased N2O emissions by 40.7% and 21.7% during the 2021 and 2022 maize seasons, respectively. The N2O emission factors (EF-N2O) of applied N was 0.90-1.71% during the 2022 maize season, which was ten times greater than the 2021 maize season. We further evaluated correlation between EF-N2O of mineral N fertilizer and annual precipitation in temperate sandy soils by compiling published literature, suggesting that there was a quadratic relationship between EF-N2O and precipitation, with the highest EF-N2O occurring at similar to 690 mm of precipitation. Accordingly, extreme precipitation would induce explosive N2O emissions at optimal scenario. Overall, our results suggest that replacing mineral fertilizers with dairy effluent mitigated N2O and NO emissions while heavy rainfall could cause N2O paroxysmal emission. Thus, rational water management in temperate farms is particularly required to avoid N2O surge emission after heavy rainfall events, and urease inhibitors co-application with nitrification inhibitors are recommended under dairy effluent application.

AB The use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture is a significant source of reactive nitrogen compounds for the atmosphere. Emissions of NO, NH3, and N2O were measured on irrigated maize fields, on acidic podzols, set up in a large pine tree forest system in the southwestern part of France. Measurements were carried out over a yearly period: before, during, and after fertilization. Trace gas emissions appear to be strongly linked to soil characteristics and to the type of fertilizer and application procedures used. All emissions are strongly enhanced after fertilizer application, although NO and N2O emissions are observed all year long. No emission was observed on forest soils which only constitute an atmospheric NO2 sink. The imbalance of the nitrogen budget (up to 100 kg N ha-1) might be explained by gaseous emissions into the atmosphere, watertable pollution by nitrate and ammonium ions remaining very low. This is one of the peculiarities of this agrosystem.

AB Biochar application has been reported to effectively mitigate N2O emissions and increase crop yield; however, its long-term residual effects remain largely unknown. A four-year field experiment was designed in the North China Plain (NCP) to evaluate the residual effect of biochar on N2O and NO emissions and crop yield under maize-wheat rotation. The study included five treatments: no N fertilization (Control), N fertilizer application (CN), and N fertilizer plus maize-straw biochar application at 3 (NB3), 6 (NB6) and 12 t ha(-1) (NB12). Biochar amendment had no effect on maize yield during the four-year rotation, but increased maize grain N uptake by 12.9 - 14.1 % and fertilizer N use efficiency by 13.8 % in the fourth year. Meanwhile, NB12 treatment decreased wheat yield by 11.7 - 15.5 % in each year, except the second, while decreased average wheat yield. Biochar application significantly reduced N2O emissions by 31.5 - 42.4 % during the first maize season, and by 6.9 - 21.3 % in the third and fourth years primarily due to reduction in NH4+ availability for nitrification. Furthermore, this mitigation effect was positively related to soil moisture content and decreased with time after biochar application. Cumulative N2O emissions during the four wheat seasons were 0.25 - 0.85 kg N2O-N ha(-1), and only decreased by 8.9 - 9.9 % under biochar amendment in the third and fourth years probably because low soil temperature suppressed N2O production. Biochar addition in the third and fourth years significantly reduced NO emissions by 9.0 - 20.1 % during the maize growing seasons and 10.5 - 19.1 % during the wheat growing seasons, especially under NB6 treatment. The average yield-scaled N2O and NO emissions were lowest in the NB6 treatment during the maize and wheat season. Overall, these findings suggest that 6 t ha(-1) is the optimal biochar application rate for reducing N2O/NO emissions and yield-scaled N2O/NO emission under four-year maize-wheat rotation in the NCP.

AB Fertilized agricultural soil is a significant source of gaseous nitrogen compounds (GNCs), including N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3. The North China Plain (NCP) is the "hot region" for the release of these GNCs due to intensive fertilization practices. However, existing research has primarily focused on N2O emissions from fertilized farmland in the NCP, lacking comprehensive observational studies on other GNCs. Therefore, a continuous cumulative sampling technique (open-top dynamic chamber system) was utilized in this study to simultaneously measure the exchange fluxes of N2O, NO, HONO, and NH3 over summer maize-winter wheat rotation fields in the NCP. Results showed that GNC emissions from the soil displayed distinct diurnal variations, with higher emissions during the day attributed to elevated soil temperature. However, N2O emissions remained consistent between day and night, potentially influenced not only by soil temperature but also by soil humidity. Annual cumulative emissions and emission factors (EFs) for four GNCs were determined, indicating that N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions during the maize season were 1.38-2.37 times higher than those during the wheat season, with 98 % of HONO emissions occurring in the maize season. Additionally, the study first presented the annual HONO EFs of 0.36 +/- 0.03 % in fertilized farmland. Furthermore, a comparison revealed that the fluxes of N2O, NO, NH3, and HONO using the conventional single-point sampling method were 26.4 %, 13.9 %, and 8.10 % lower, and 7.86 % higher compared to the continuous cumulative sampling method recommended in this study. In general, this study provided precise measurements of GNC emissions from farmland, offering essential foundational data for modeling parameters and contributing to the formulation of regional air pollution prevention and control policies.

AB Feeding a growing population, which will reach 10 billion in 2050, is a major challenge. Another major challenge is to increase crops' productivity in a sustainable way, as the increase in agricultural inputs may lead to greenhouse gas emissions, including N2O fertiliser. Several factors can influence N2O emissions such as irrigation, the soil management system, or the type of fertiliser used. The aim of this research is to study the impact of each above-mentioned factor on N2O emissions during three growing seasons in a maize field, considering three nitrogen fertilisers: urea (U), ammonium nitrate (AN), and a fertiliser with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP); two irrigation strategies: on demand (100%) and deficit irrigation (75% of demand); and a comparison of two soil management systems: conventional tillage (T) systems and no-tillage (NT) system. The interactions among the three factors and their effects on emissions were analysed through a principal component analysis. Higher emissions were recorded in plots that received the highest irrigation dose. The most favourable management to reduce N2O emissions derived from agricultural activity for maize crops under a Mediterranean climate was the NT soil management, using a fertiliser with nitrification inhibitor and an irrigation dose of 75% of conventional irrigation.

AB Straw return to agricultural soils is considered as a key strategy to improve soil organic C (SOC) sequestration and crop production. However, changes in SOC can affect soil N-turnover and associated N2O and NO fluxes, as soil biogeochemical C- and N-cycles are strongly coupled. Understanding how and to what extent N-trace gas emissions per unit crop yield respond to changes in SOC following straw return, is critical for balancing food security and climate change mitigation. Here we report on an experiment in a Chinese wheat-maize system designed to understand the effects of long-term (2005-2020) different straw management options (straw return, burning or removal) on SOC stocks and yields, completed by N2O and NO flux measurements over the period 2016-2020. Our results showed that the increase in SOC stocks following straw return tended to level off over time, indicating that SOC saturation is reached after 12-13 years under straw return. Soil N-trace gas emissions showed high inter- and intra-annual variability, which were largely driven by changes in rainfall, soil hydrothermal conditions or soil C- and N-availability. Compared to straw burning or removal, long-term straw return increased annual N2O emissions by 9 %-49 %, to 2.72-2.98 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), while NO emissions were decreased by 12 %-28 %, to 0.83-0.90 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The annual N2O emissions roughly offset the total C sink (SOC sequestration and CH4 uptake) by 40 %-46 %, but will override the climate benefits of total C sink as the SOC pool becomes saturated. However, because yields were higher in straw return treatments, yield-scaled annual N2O emissions remained unchanged. Our unique dataset allows for the first time a better understanding of the dynamics between SOC sequestration, yields and N-trace gas emissions, with results calling for action to address the risk of increasing N2O emissions following long-term SOC increases induced by straw return.

AB N2O and NO emissions, the water usage and grain yields of a maize field in the North China Plain (NCP) under traditional flood irrigation, drip irrigation and drip fertigation were compared. With respect to the flood irrigation treatment, N2O emissions were reduced by 13.8% in the drip irrigation treatment and 7.7% in the drip fertigation treatment. NO emissions were reduced to 16.7% in the drip irrigation treatment but increased by 21.7% in the drip fertigation treatment. The molar ratios of NO/N2O within 2 days after each fertilization event were evidently greater from the drip fertigation treatment than from the flood irrigation treatment, indicating that nitrification was more intensive in the drip fertigation treatment than in the treatment of flood irrigation. Compared with the flood irrigation treatment, evident increase of the maize yields in the drip irrigation treatment (28%) and the drip fertigation treatment (3.7%) were found. Although the drip fertigation treatment could evidently increase NO emission, the 40% water reduction in drip fertigation is of great importance for the sustainable development of agriculture in the NCP where water resources are extremely limited. To mitigate NO emissions from agricultural fields in the NCP with drip fertigation, the addition of a nitrification inhibitor combined with N or nitrate fertilizer was recommended.

AB We measured nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions during the snow-free season (April-November) over a 3-year period (1998-2000) from a Silandic Andosols Cultivated with maize (Zea mays L.) in central Hokkaido, Japan. In May, before furrowing, composted cattle manure was broadcast onto the field at a rate of 3.0 g N m(-2). After furrowing, chemical fertilizer (NH4)(2)SO4-N + (NH4)(3)PO4-N : urea-N at a ratio of 10:3 was applied to the row at a rate of 13 g N m(-2). An impermeable layer lay 1.3 in below ground level. As a result, after heavy rains and during the snow-melting period, the groundwater table rose to near the ground surface. The N2O and NO emission rates ranged from 0.0 to 6.4 and from 0.00 to 0.94 mg N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The highest N2O emission was observed after heavy rain in summer and autumn. The magnitude and seasonal pattern of N2O emissions from the inter row were similar to those from the row itself, although chemical fertilizer had not been applied to the inter row. In contrast, all increase in NO emissions was observed only from the row. Seasonal fluctuations ill Soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations and the emission ratio N2O-N/NO-N suggested that N2O and NO emitted after fertilizer application (May to early July) were produced mainly by nitrification, whereas N2O emitted after heavy rains (after mid-July) was produced mainly by derntrification. Total N2O and NO emissions during the snow-free season ranged from 0.7 to 2.8 and from 0.0 to 0.7 g N m(-2), respectively, over a 3-year period. The N2O and NO emissions from our field were relatively high compared with those reported worldwide. In contrast, reported N2O emission rates from agricultural Andosols in Japan are typically lower than those from other agricultural soils in Japan and around the world. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that high N2O emissions may occur from Japanese agricultural Andosols that are poorly drained.

AB To investigate the impact of different forms of plant-derived organic matter on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, an incubation experiment with the same rate of total nitrogen (N) application was carried out at 25 degrees C for 250 days. Soils were incorporated with maize-derived organic matter (i. e., maize residuederived dissolved organic matter and maize residues with different C/N ratios) and an inorganic N fertilizer (urea). The pattern and magnitude of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were affected by the form of N applied. Single application of maize-derived organic matter resulted in a higher N2O emission than single application of the inorganic N fertilizer or combined application of the inorganic N fertilizer and maize-derived organic matter. The positive effect of maize residue-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) addition on N2O emissions was relatively short-lived and mainly occurred at the early stage following DOM addition. In contrast, the positive effect induced by maize residue addition was more pronounced and lasted for a longer period. Single application of maize residues resulted in a substantial decrease in soil nitric nitrogen (NO3- -N), but it did not affect the production of N2O. No significant relationship between N2O emission and NO3--N and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) suggested that the availability of soil N was not limiting the production of N2O in our study. The key factors affecting soil N2O emission were the soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and metabolism quotient (qCO(2)). Both of them could explain 87% of the variation in cumulative N2O emission. The C/N ratio of maizederived organic matter was a poor predictor of N2O emission when the soil was not limited by easily available C and the available N content met the microbial N demands for nitrification and denitrification. The results suggested that the magnitude of N2O emission was determined by the impact of organic amendments on soil C availability and microbial activity rather than on soil N availability. In agricultural management practices, if the N inputs from organic and inorganic N fertilizers are equivalent, addition of organic N fertilizers that contain high amounts of available C will result in a higher N2O emission.

AB Abating large losses of nitrogen (N) oxides while maintaining or enhancing crop yield is a major goal in irrigated maize (Zea mays L) cropping areas. During two consecutive campaigns, the new nitrification inhibitor 2-(3,4-dimethy1-1H-pyrazol-1-y1) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA) applied with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and the same fertilizer applied by drip-fertigation without the inhibitor, were evaluated and compared with CAN broadcast to the surface and irrigated with sprinklers. Concurrently, urea-based treatments such as urea-fertigation and the broadcast application of urea combined with sprinkler irrigation, with or without the urease inhibitor N-butyl thiophosphorictriamide (NBPT), were also assessed. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes, grain and biomass yield and yield scaled N2O emissions of the different treatments were compared. Additionally, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured. On average, fertigation treatments led to a mitigation of N2O emissions with respect to sprinkler irrigation by 80% and 78% for CAN and urea, respectively. With regards to inhibitor-based strategies, the use of DMPSA and NBPT reduced N2O losses by 58% and 51%, respectively, considering the average of both maize cropping seasons. Since no differences in grain yield were observed between fertilized treatments, DMPSA and fertigation treatments gave the lowest values of yield-scaled N2O emissions, leading to reductions of 63%, 71% and 78% for CAN with DMPSA, urea-fertigation and CAN-fertigation, respectively, with respect to conventional management strategies (surface broadcast application and sprinkler irrigation). Low NO emissions during the first campaign masked differences between treatments, whereas during the second season, NO losses significantly decreased in the following order: conventional treatments > inhibitors > fertigation. Comparing conventional management practices, CAN significantly decreased emissions of N oxides compared with urea, but this effect was only observed in the second maize cropping season. The moisture distribution pattern in drip plots (dry and wet areas) caused a reduction of CH4 sink (only in one of the two seasons) and respiration fluxes, in comparison to sprinkler. This study shows that the use of the new nitrification inhibitor DMPSA and drip-fertigation should be promoted in irrigated maize agro-ecosystems, in order to mitigate emissions of N oxides without penalizing grain yield and leading to similar or enhanced biomass production.

AB Emissions of nitrogen compounds (NO, NH3, N2O and N-2) from heavily fertilized (280 kg(N) ha(-1)) and irrigated maize fields were studied over an annual cultivation cycle in southwestern France. NO and N2O emissions were measured by chamber techniques throughout the year. During fertilization and maize growth periods, chamber measurements were intensified and complemented by flux-gradient micrometeorological measurements of NOx and NH3. The two methods used, Bowen ratio and a simplified aerodynamical techniques, agree quite well and quantify NOx and NH3 flux variations during the period of intense emission which followed fertilizer application. Over a yearly cycle, nitrogen loss in the form of NH3, NO and N2O were calculated using micrometeorological flux measurements and emission algorithms calibrated with field data (chambers). The soil denitrification potential represented by the ratio N2O/(N2O+N-2) was measured in the laboratory to calculate potential total gaseous nitrogen loss. Taking into account all uncertainties, the total N loss into the atmosphere represents 30 to 110 kg(N) ha(-1) with about less than 1% as NH3, 40% as NO, 14% as N2O and 46% as N-2. This is in agreement with the agronomic nitrogen budget based on the N fertilizer input and soil furniture and, on the N-output by crops and crop residues, which displays a net imbalance of 50 to 100 kg(N) ha(-1).

AB Replacing paddy rice by upland systems such as maize cultivation is an on-going trend in SE Asia caused by increasing water scarcity and higher demand for meat. How such land management changes will feedback on soil C and N cycles and soil greenhouse gas emissions is not well understood at present.
   A new LandscapeDNDC biogeochemical module was developed that allows the effect of land management changes on soil C and N cycle to be simulated. The new module is applied in combination with further modules simulating microclimate and crop growth and evaluated against observations from field experiments.
   The model simulations agree well with observed dynamics of CH (4) emissions in paddy rice depending on changes in climatic conditions and agricultural management. Magnitude and peak emission periods of N (2) O from maize cultivation are simulated correctly, though there are still deficits in reproducing day-to-day dynamics. These shortcomings are most likely related to simulated soil hydrology and may only be resolved if LandscapeDNDC is coupled to more complex hydrological models.
   LandscapeDNDC allows for simulation of changing land management practices in SE Asia. The possibility to couple LandscapeDNDC to more complex hydrological models is a feature needed to better understand related effects on soil-atmosphere-hydrosphere interactions.

AB One-year winter wheat-summer maize rotation is the most popular double cropping system in north-central China, and this highly productive system is an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions due to the high fertilizer N and irrigation water inputs. To sustain the high crop production and mitigate the detrimental impacts of N2O and NO emissions, improved management practices are extensively applied. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the effects of an improved management practice of irrigation, fertilization and crop straw on grain yield and N2O and NO emissions for a wheat-maize rotation field in northern China. Using automated and manual chamber measuring systems, we monitored N2O and NO fluxes for the conventional (CT, 2007-2008), improved (IT, 2007-2008), straw-amended (WS, 2008-2009), straw-not-amended (NS, 2008-2009), and no N-fertilizer treatments (WS-NN, 2008-2009), respectively, for one rotation-year. The grain yields were determined for CT and IT for three rotation-years (2005-2008) and for WS, NS and WS-NN for one rotation-year (2008-2009). The improved management of irrigation and fertilization reduced the annual N fertilization rate and irrigation amount by 17% and 30%, respectively; increased the maize yield by 7-14%; and significantly decreased the N2O and NO emissions by 7% (p < 0.05) and 29% (p < 0.01), respectively. The incorporation of wheat straw increased the cumulative N2O and NO emissions in the following maize season by 58% (p < 0.01) and 13%, respectively, whereas the effects of maize straw application were not remarkable. The N2O and NO emission factors of applied N were 2.32 +/- 2.32% and 0.42 +/- 1.69% for wheat straw and 0.67 +/- 0.23% and 0.54 +/- 0.15% for chemical N-fertilizers, respectively. Compared to conventional management practices using high application rates of irrigation water and chemical N-fertilizer as well as the field burning of crop straw, the improved management strategy presented here has obvious environmentally positive effects on grain yield and mitigation of N2O and NO emissions.

AB A 3-year field experiment (October 2004-October 2007) was conducted to quantify N2O fluxes and determine the regulating factors from rain-fed, N fertilized wheat-maize rotation in the Sichuan Basin, China.
   Static chamber-GC techniques were used to measure soil N2O fluxes in three treatments (three replicates per treatment): CK (no fertilizer); N150 (300 kg N fertilizer ha(-1) yr(-1) or 150 kg N ha(-1) per crop); N250 (500 kg N fertilizer ha(-1) yr(-1) kg or 250 kg N ha(-1) per crop). Nitrate (NO (3) (-) ) leaching losses were measured at nearby sites using free-drained lysimeters.
   The annual N2O fluxes from the N fertilized treatments were in the range of 1.9 to 6.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) corresponding to an N2O emission factor ranging from 0.12 % to 1.06 % (mean value: 0.61 %). The relationship between monthly soil N2O fluxes and NO (3) (-) leaching losses can be described by a significant exponential decaying function.
   The N2O emission factor obtained in our study was somewhat lower than the current IPCC default emission factor (1 %). Nitrate leaching, through removal of topsoil NO (3) (-) , is an underrated regulating factor of soil N2O fluxes from cropland, especially in the regions where high NO (3) (-) leaching losses occur.

The extensive use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers during the cultivation of both crops leads to significant losses of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into the environment. Here, using machine learning algorithms, we generate high-resolution maps of crop-specific soil Nr losses based on global field measurements. We estimate that global annual soil Nr losses from the use of synthetic N fertilizer in 2020, including direct emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), ammonia (NH3), N leaching and run-off, amount to 0.18, 1.62, 0.09, 1.47 and 1.10 million tonnes N for maize, and 0.12, 1.33, 0.07, 1.21 and 0.95 million tonnes N for wheat, respectively. The annual indirect N2O emissions induced by synthetic N fertilizer use from these soil Nr losses are estimated to be 45,000 and 37,000 tonnes for maize and wheat, respectively, with hydrologic pathways playing a predominant role. Enhancing N use efficiency up to 60% for regions below this value can achieve a total soil Nr loss mitigation potential of 4.00 million tonnes per year for the two crops, thereby reducing indirect N2O emissions by 49%. Our results contribute to constrain global N budgets from the use of fertilizer in agriculture, which then can help to improve projections of nitrogen cycle-climate feedbacks using modelling approaches.

AB Quantifying the nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes emitted from croplands remains a major challenge. Field measurements in different climates, soil and agricultural conditions are still scarce and emissions are generally assessed from a small number of measurements. In this study, we report continuously measured N2O and NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over a 2-year crop sequence of barley and maize in northern France. Measurements were carried out using 6 automatic chambers at a rate of 16 mean flux measurements per day. Additional laboratory measurements on soil cores were conducted to study the response of NO and N2O emissions to environmental conditions.
   The detection limit of the chamber setup was found to be 3 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for N2O and 0.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for NO. Nitrous oxide fluxes were higher than the threshold 37% of the time, while they were 72% of the time for NO fluxes.
   The cumulated annual NO and N2O emissions were 1.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 0.5 kg NO-N ha(-1) in 2007, but 2.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and 0.7 kg NO-N ha(-1) in 2008. These inter-annual differences were largely related to crop types and to their respective management practices. The forms, amounts and timing of nitrogen applications and the mineralization of organic matter by incorporation of crop residues were found to be the main factor controlling the emissions peaks. The inter-annual variability was also due to different weather conditions encountered in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, the fractioned N inputs applied on barley (54 kg ha(-1) in March and in April) did not generate N2O emissions peaks because of the low rainfall during the spring. However, the significant rainfall observed in the summer and fall of 2007, promoted rapid decomposition of barley residues which caused high levels of N2O emissions. In 2008, the application of dairy cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer before the emergence of maize (107 kg N-min ha(-1) or 130 kg N-tot ha(-1) in all) coincided with large rainfalls promoting both NO and N2O emissions, which remained high until early summer.
   Laboratory measurements corroborated the field observations: NO fluxes were maximum at a water-filled pore space (WFPS) of around 27% while N2O fluxes were optimal at 68% WFPS, with a maximum potentially 14 times larger than for NO. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Split application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers during different crop growth stages to fulfill the crop N requirements reduces soil mineral N concentrations and improves the efficiency of crop N fertilizer use, and can decrease nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from the soil. However, inconsistent results regarding N2O emissions have been reported in rainfed areas. Furthermore, few long-term studies have explained the effects of split N application on soil methane (CH4) flux, thus limiting complete assessment of the effects of split N application on total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, long-term monitoring is urgently required to understand the impacts of split N application on GHG emissions in rainfed areas. In this study, a 6-year field experiment was conducted in a rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) field in Northeast China. The experiment included three treatments: no N application representing control (CK), single application at the sowing stage of maize (SU), and split N at the sowing and jointing stages at a ratio of 1: 2 (SF). Between the sowing and jointing stages, N2O emissions were significantly higher in SU than in SF. However, high N2O emissions were observed in SF for 1 month after N application at the jointing stage possibly because the time of N application coincided with optimum precipitation and soil temperature conditions, which stimulated N2O emissions. Overall, the total N2O emissions showed no significant difference between SU and SF. During the study period, split application of N fertilizer did not significantly affect the cumulative CH4 flux. Compared to CK, the yield-scaled GWP in SF treatment increased by 18.7% (p < 0.05). Ammonia (NH3) volatilization in SF was 272% higher than that in SU. The findings indicated that split N application exhibited an environmental risk by increasing the yield-scaled GWP and NH3 emissions in the field. Thus, this study suggested that single N application applied in the sowing stage should be employed in rainfed fields to mitigate the yield-scaled GWP and NH3 emissions, and maintain efficient maize yields.

AB NO and NO emissions from an Andisol maize field were studied. The experimental treatments were incorporation of urea into the plough layer at 250 kg N ha(-1) by two applications (U1250), band application of urea at a depth of 8 cm at 75 kg N ha(-1) plus incorporation of urea into the plough layer at 75 kg N ha(-1) (UB150), band application of polyolefin-coated urea at a depth of 5 cm at 150 kg N ha(-1) (CB150), and a control (without N application). N2O fluxes from U1250 and UB 150 peaked following the incorporation of supplementary fertilizer, and declined to the background level after that, while the NO flux from CB 150 was relatively low but remained at constant level until shortly after harvest. Accordingly, the total N2O emissions during the whole cultivation period from the three treatments were not significantly different. The fertilizer-derived N2O-N losses from U1250, UB150 and CB150 were 0.15%, 0.27% and 0.28% of the applied N, respectively. However, it was suggested that, due to the low plant N recovery, U1250 had a significantly larger potential for indirect N2O emission than the other treatments. On the other hand, NO emissions from U1250 and UB 150 were 12 times higher than that from CB 150, and the fertilizer-derived NO-N losses from the three treatments were 0.16%, 0.27% and 0.026% of the applied N, respectively. Significant NO fluxes were detected only when urea-N fertilizer was surface-applied and incorporated into plough-layer soil.

AB N2O and NO emissions from a winter wheat-summer maize rotation field with five different treatments in the North China Plain (NCP) were comparably investigated from 8 October 2014 to 11 October 2015. Compared with the treatments with only flood or drip irrigation, evident emission peaks of N2O and NO from the fertilization treatments with flood irrigation (A-Flood) and with drip fertigation (A-Drip) were observed after each fertilization event, whereas their emissions from the fertilization treatments with nitrification inhibitors under drip fertigation (A + DCD-Drip and A + Nitrapyrin-Drip) were greatly suppressed. The reduction effect of the nitrification inhibitors on N2O and NO emissions was found to be more conspicuous during the maize season than during the wheat season, implying that the soil temperature could play an important role in the reduction effect. Compared with the A-Flood treatment, the annual cumulative emission from the A-Drip treatment reduced by 22% for N2O and increased by 18% for NO, whereas the reductions of N2O and NO from the treatments with nitrification inhibitors could achieve as high as 66% and 95%, respectively. The yields of the maize were significantly greater from the A-Drip and A + Nitrapyrin-Drip treatments than from the A-Flood treatment, and the yields of the wheat were almost same among the treatments of A-Flood, A-Drip and A + DCD-Drip. Considering the yields, the water saving and the reduction of N2O and NO emissions, the application of nitrification inhibitor combined with drip fertigation is recommended in the NCP.

AB Returning crop residues to agricultural fields can accelerate nutrient turnover and increase N2O and NO emissions. Increased microbial respiration may lead to formation of local hotspots with anoxic or microoxic conditions promoting denitrification. To investigate the effect of litter quality on CO2, NO, N2O, and N-2 emissions, we conducted a laboratory incubation study in a controlled atmosphere (He/O-2, or pure He) with different maize litter types (Zea mays L., young leaves and roots, straw). We applied the N2O isotopocule mapping approach to distinguish between N2O emitting processes and partitioned the CO2 efflux into litter- and soil organic matter (SOM)-derived CO2 based on the natural C-13 isotope abundances. Maize litter increased total and SOM derived CO2 emissions leading to a positive priming effect. Although C turnover was high, NO and N2O fluxes were low under oxic conditions as high O-2 diffusivity limited denitrification. In the first week, nitrification contributed to NO emissions, which increased with increasing net N mineralization. Isotopocule mapping indicated that bacterial processes dominated N2O formation in litter-amended soil in the beginning of the incubation experiment with a subsequent shift towards fungal denitrification. With onset of anoxic incubation conditions after 47 days, N fluxes strongly increased, and heterotrophic bacterial denitrification became the main source of N2O. The N2O/(N2O+N-2) ratio decreased with increasing litter C:N ratio and C-org:NO3- ratio in soil, confirming that the ratio of available C:N is a major control of denitrification product stoichiometry.

AB Organic fertilizers may differ greatly in composition and as a result there may also be differences in nitrogen oxides emissions following their application to soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of mineral and organic N fertilizers on the nitrification and denitrification processes, and consequently on N2O and NO emissions. Therefore, a field experiment was carried out on an irrigated sandy loam soil under Mediterranean conditions during the maize (Zea mays L.) growing season. Untreated pig slurry (UPS) both with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (UPS + DCD), digested thin pig slurry fraction (DTP), composted solid fraction of slurry mixed with urea (CPS + U) and composted municipal solid waste mixed with urea (MSW + U) were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N ha(-1). Their emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment to which no nitrogen fertilization was administered (Control). Accumulated nitrous oxide losses during the crop season ranged from 6.0 to 9.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the Control and CPS + U, respectively, whereas nitric oxide losses ranged from 0.01 to 0.23 kg NO-N ha(-1), for the Control and U, respectively. The use of digested slurries mitigated N2O emission by 25% in relation to untreated pig slurry, but NO emissions were similar for both treatments. Dicyandiamide reduced N2O and NO emissions by 64 and 78% with respect to slurry without the inhibitor. An indirect effect of DCD on denitrification was also observed, with a reduction of 32% in denitrification with respect to the slurry without the inhibitor. In this case, the greatest reduction in denitrification losses occurred during the irrigation period. Composts mixed with urea reduced NO emissions by 56% (CPS + U) and 85% (MSW + U) in relation to the urea treatment, but its effect on N2O depended on the type of compost involved: CPS + U increased NO emission by 27%, whereas MSW + U reduced it by 55% in relation to urea. Denitrification was the most important process responsible for N2O emissions when organic fertilizers were applied to the soil, while nitrification was the most important for the inorganic fertilizer. The C:N ratio of fertilizers was a good predictor of their NO emissions, denitrification losses and N2O/N-2 ratio. On the other hand, added soluble N was a good predictor for cumulative N2O emissions during the period before irrigation. This work shows that an appropriate selection of organic fertilizers based on their composition could be used to mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and NO in comparison with urea.

AB The semi-arid region of Chiapas is dominated by N-2-fixing shrubs, e. g., Acacia angustissima. Urea-fertilized soil samples under maize were collected from areas covered and uncovered by A. angustissima in different seasons and N2O and CO2 emissions were monitored. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of urea and of the rainy and dry season on gas emissions from semi-arid soil under laboratory conditions. Urea and soil use had no effect on CO2 production. Nitrons oxide emission from soil was three times higher in the dry than in the rainy season, while urea fertilization doubled emissions. Emissions were twice as high from soil sampled under A. angustissima canopy than from arable land, but 1.2 lower than from soil sampled outside the canopy, and five times higher from soil incubated at 40 % of the water-holding capacity (WHC) than at soil moisture content, but 15 times lower than from soil incubated at 100 WHC. It was found that the soil sampling time and water content had a significant effect on N2O emissions, while N fertilizer and sampling location were less influent.

AB Conversion from synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer to organic manure has been well documented to effectively mitigate nitric oxide (NO) emissions in the current year or growing season. However, a clear understanding of NO emissions following long-term manure substitution is lacking. We hypothesize that soil conditions (particularly the accumulation of organic matter) following long-term manure substitution may stimulate NO emissions by providing more N substrates under favorable conditions. The primary aims of this study were to (1) quantify the long-term effects of manure substitution on NO emissions, and (2) identify the major regulating factors that contribute to the variations. Field measurements were conducted under summer maize-winter wheat rotations in a long-term fertilization experiment (since 1990) over three experimental years (from June 2016 to May 2019). The three treatments included an unfertilized control (CK), full synthetic urea in both crop seasons (NPK), and full synthetic urea in the maize season with 70% urea substituted by dairy manure in the winter wheat season (NPKM). Annual NO emissions varied from 0.10 to 0.22 kg N ha-1 and from 0.32 to 1.53 kg N ha-1 in CK and the fertilized treatments, respectively. We attributed the variations in annual NO emissions from the fertilized treatments to mean soil temperature by fitting a significant linear regression between the two variables (r2 = 0.681, p = 0.008). Seasonal NO emissions from NPKM treatment were lower (range, 2-66%, not always significant) and larger (range, 115-294%, not always significant) than those from NPK during the winter wheat and maize seasons, respectively. Annual NO emissions from NPKM treatment were 78% larger (range, 44-112%, not always significant) than those from NPK across the experimental years. Overall, this three-year field measurement revealed that cumulative NO emissions from NPKM treatment were significantly (p = 0.038) larger than those from NPK (2.73 versus 1.53 kg N ha-1). We concluded that long-term manure substitution for synthetic fertilizer in the winter wheat seasons did not mitigate, but rather stimulated cumulative NO emissions.

AB Global nitrogen fertilizer consumption is expected to continue to increase. To explore effective mitigation strategies, a deeper understanding of the responses of nitrogen use efficiency, nitric oxide (NO) emission and the NO direct emission factor (EFd) to increasing fertilization rates is needed. A gradient of fertilization rates (0,135, 270, 430, 650 and 850 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the form of urea, hereafter referred to as NO, N135, N270, N430, N650 and N850, respectively) was used to fully represent the nitrogen application levels in the wheat-maize rotational cropping system that has been widely adopted in China. The annual NO emissions ranged from 0.43 +/- 0.04 (NO) to 2.64 +/- 0.35 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (N850) and linearly increased with increasing fertilization rates (P < 0.01). The high pH and low carbon availability in the calcareous soil limited NO production; thus, low EFd values (0.26-0.36%) were observed. The partial factor productivity of applied nitrogen (PFPN) rapidly decreased with increasing fertilization rates; the relationship could be characterized by a rectangular hyperbolic function (P < 0.01). The expected trade-off between EFd and PFPN was not observed. The on-farm PFPN was only 33 +/- 3 kg grain kg(-1) N (N430), highlighting the necessity of optimizing current management strategies. Based on a review of previous studies, a comprehensive optimized management strategy is recommended to obtain the maximum benefits for multiple goals of a wheat-maize cropping system. However, consecutive field observations and model studies are still needed to validate the long-term effects of this management strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Land use changes and land use intensification are considered important processes contributing to the increasing concentrations of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) and of nitric oxide (NO), a precursor of ozone. Studies on the effects of land use changes and land use intensification on soil trace gas emissions were mostly conducted in Latin America and only very few in Asia. Here we present results from Central Sulawesi where profound changes in land use and cultivation practices take place: traditional agricultural practices like shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn agriculture are replaced by permanent cultivation systems and introduction of income-generating cash crops like cacao. Our results showed that N2O emissions were higher from cacao agroforestry (35 +/- 10 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) than maize (9 +/- 2 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)), whereas intermediate rates were observed from secondary forests (25 +/- 11 mg N m(-2) h(-1)). NO emissions did not differ among land use systems, ranging from 12 +/- 2 mg N m(-2) h(-1) for cacao agroforestry and secondary forest to 18 +/- 2 mg N m(-2) h(-1) for maize. CH4 uptake was higher for maize (-30 +/- 4 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) than cacao agroforestry (-18 +/- 2 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) and intermediate rates were measured from secondary forests (-25 +/- 4 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)). Combining these data with results from other studies in this area, we present chronosequence effects of land use change on trace gas emissions from natural forest, through maize cultivation, to cacao agroforestry (with or without fertilizer). Compared to the original forests, this typical land use change in the study area clearly led to higher N2O emissions and lower CH4 uptake with age of cacao agroforestry systems. We conclude that this common land use sequence in the area combined with the increasing use of fertilizer will strongly increase soil trace gas emissions. We suggest that the future hot spot regions of high N2O (and to a lesser extend NO) emissions in the tropics are those areas where climatic and edaphic conditions allow for intensive agriculture. This scenario is probably preferable over the alternative of agriculture extensification, which would imply a dramatic increase in deforestation rates with accompanying CO2 emissions.

AB Rainfed agriculture is one of the most common farming practices in the world and is vulnerable to global climate change. However, only limited studies have been conducted on rainfed agriculture, mainly using low-frequency manual techniques, which caused large uncertainties in estimating annual N2O emissions. In this study, we used a fully automated system to continuously measure soil N2O emissions for two years (April 2017 to March 2019) in a typical rainfed maize field in Northeast China. The annual N2O emissions were 2.8 kg N ha(-1) in year 1 (April 2017 to March 2018) and 1.8 kg N ha(-1) in year 2 (April 2018 to March 2019), accounting for 1.9 and 1.2% of the nitrogen fertilizer applied, respectively. The inter-annual variability was mainly due to different weather conditions encountered in years 1 and 2. A severe drought in year 1 reduced plant N uptake, leaving high mineral N in the soil, and the following moderate rainfalls promoted a large amount of N2O emissions. The seasonal pattern of N2O fluxes was mainly controlled by soil temperature and soil nitrate concentration. Both soil moisture and the molar ratio of NO/N2O indicate that N2O and NO were mainly derived from nitrification, resulting in a significant positive correlation between N2O and NO flux in the intra-rows (where nitrogen fertilizer was applied). Moreover, we observed that the N2O emissions during the freeze-thaw periods were negligible in this region for rainfed agriculture. Our long-term and high-resolution measurements of soil N2O emissions suggest that sampling between LST 9:00 and 10:00 is the best empirical sampling time for the intermittent manual measurements.

AB To understand the influence of basal application of N fertilizer on nitrification potential and N2O and NO emissions, four soil samples were collected from an upland Andisol field just before (sample 1) and 4 (sample 2), 36 (sample 3) and 72 (sample 4) days after the basal application of N fertilizer during the Chinese cabbage growing season from 12 September to 30 November 2005. The potentials of N2O production and nitrification of the soils were determined using a N-15 tracer technique and the soils were incubated for 25 days at 250 degrees C and 60% water-filled pore space (WFPS). The results revealed that as much as 84-97% N2O and almost all NO were produced by nitrification. The 15 N2O emission peak occurred approximately 350 h after the beginning of incubation for samples 1 and 2, but just 48 h later in samples 3 and 4. Total (N2O)-N-15 emission during the 25-day incubation of samples 3 and 4 ranged from 190 to 198 mu g N kg(-1) soil, which was significantly higher than the 99-108 mu g N kg(-1) soil recorded in samples 1 and 2. Basal application of N fertilizer did not immediately increase the nitrification potential and the ratio of N2O to N added, but did dramatically increase the nitrification potential and the ratio of N2O to N added as ((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4 36-72 days after the basal N fertilizer was added. In contrast, NO emission was negatively correlated with nitrification potential and total N2O emission. As a result, a trade-off relationship between total NO and N2O emissions was identified. The results indicated that there was a time-lagged induction of the change of N turnover in the soil, which was possibly caused by slow population growth of the nitrifiers and/or a slow shift in the microbial community in the soil.

AB The exchange fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) from a maize field with three different treatments were simultaneously measured using static and dynamic chambers in the North China Plain (NCP) from June 28 to October 11, 2009. The three treatments included control plot (CK, without crop, fertilization and irrigation), fertilizer N plot (NP) and wheat straw returning plus fertilizer N plot (SN). N-fertilizer application greatly stimulated the emissions of N2O, NOx and NH3, with durations of about 10 days for N2O and NO, and about 7 days for NH3. Fertilizer loss rates were 1.08% (NP plot) and 1.20% (SN plot) as N2O-N, were 1.93% (NP plot) and 0.76% (SN plot) as NO-N, and were 5.24% (NP plot) and 3.03% (SN plot) as NH3-N. In comparison with the NP plot, the significant low fertilizer loss rates as NO-N and NH3-N from the SN plot indicated that the wheat straw returning to the field could reduce NOx and NH3 emissions. The molar ratio of NO/N2O was greater than unity for most data during the pulse emission periods induced by fertilization, and thus, nitrification was the dominant process for N2O and NO emissions during these periods. Considering the significant amount (>80%) of N2O and NOx emissions occurred during the pulse emission periods, the emissions of NOx and N2O from the investigated field were mainly ascribed to nitrification process.

AB Nitrogen (N) fertilizer application to agricultural soils results in substantial emissions of nitric oxide (NO), a key substance in tropospheric chemistry involved in climate forcing and air pollution. However, the estimates of global cropland NO emissions remain uncertain due to a lack of information on direct NO emission factors (EF(d)s) of applied N for various cropping systems at seasonal or annual scales. Here we quantified the crop-specific seasonal and annual-scale NO EF(d)s through synthesizing 1094 measurements from 125 field-based studies worldwide. The global mean crop-specific seasonal EFd was 0.53%, with the highest for vegetables (0.75%). Among cereal crops, the EFd of maize (0.45%) or wheat (0.47%) was about three times higher than for rice (0.12%). At annual scale, the mean EFd across all cropping systems was 0.58%, with tea plantations having the highest (1.54%). For other cropping systems, the annual-scale EF(d)s ranged from 0.02% to 1.07%. Besides crop type, also soil organic carbon, total N, and pH as well as N fertilizer type were the main factors explaining the variations of NO EF(d)s. Based on obtained specific EF(d)s for each crop type, we estimated that NO emissions due to the use of synthetic fertilizers from global croplands are about 0.42-0.62 Tg N year(-1). Our budgets are relatively lower if compared to estimates derived by the use of IPCC defaults for NO emissions (0.72-1.66 Tg N year(-1)) or reported elsewhere (0.67-1.04 Tg N year(-1)). In our estimates, cash crops (vegetable, tea and orchard), which cover only 9% of the world cropland area, contributed about 31% to total NO emissions from global fertilized croplands. Overall, our meta-analysis provides improved crop-specific NO EF(d)s reflecting current stage of knowledge. The work also highlights the relative importance of cash crop production as sources for atmospheric NO, that is, agricultural systems on which mitigation efforts may focus.

AB The exchange fluxes of NOx, NH3 and N2O between two typical agricultural fields and the atmosphere were investigated in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and North China Plain (NCP). The average fluxes of NO and NH3 from the wheat field in the YRD were 79 and -5.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1), and from the paddy field were 3.7 and 34.8 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The fertilize-induced emission factors (EFs) as NO-N and NH3-N from the wheat field were 2.3% and 1%, and from the paddy field were 0.09% and 3.5%, respectively. Remarkable yearly variation of N2O emissions from the investigated NCP maize field was observed, with average fluxes of 72.1 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in 2008 and 30 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in 2009 and with EFs of 3.78% in 2008 and 1.08% in 2009. The average NO and NH3 fluxes from the maize field in 2009 were 36.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1) and 94.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Based on the molar ratios of NO/N2O, the emissions of NOx and N2O from the maize field were mainly ascribed to nitrification processes. Returning wheat straw back into the maize field could significantly reduce NOx and NH3 emissions.

AB The application of nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural fields can lead to the release of nitrogen-containing gases (NCGs), such as NOx , NH3 and N2 O, which can significantly impact regional atmospheric environment and contribute to global climate change. However, there remain considerable research gaps in the accurate measurement of NCGs emissions from agricultural fields, hindering the development of effective emission reduction strategies. We improved an open-top dynamic chambers (OTDCs) system and evaluated the performance by comparing the measured and given fluxes of the NCGs. The results showed that the measured fluxes of NO, N2 O and NH3 were 1 %, 2 % and 7 % lower than the given fluxes, respectively. For the determination of NH3 concentration, we employed a stripping coil-ion chromatograph (SC-IC) analytical technique, which demonstrated an absorption efficiency for atmospheric NH3 exceeding 96.1 % across sampling durations of 6 to 60 min. In the summer maize season, we utilized the OTDCs system to measure the exchange fluxes of NO, NH3 , and N2 O from the soil in the North China Plain. Substantial emissions of NO, NH3 and N2 O were recorded following fertilization, with peaks of 107, 309, 1239 ng N/(m2 <middle dot>s), respectively. Notably, significant NCGs emissions were observed following sustained heavy rainfall one month after fertilization, particularly with NH3 peak being 4.5 times higher than that observed immediately after fertilization. Our results demonstrate that the OTDCs system accurately reflects the emission characteristics of soil NCGs and meets the requirements for long-term and continuous flux observation.

AB The effect of dairy manure amendments to agricultural soil on the yield-scaled nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remains unclear. We hypothesize that an optimum ratio of dairy manure to synthetic fertilizers leads to large nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and small yield-scaled N2O emissions. The aims of this study were to (1) quantify the variations in the crop yields and N2O emissions from winter wheat-summer maize cropping systems in Northwest China, (2) determine the responses of the NUE and yield-scaled N2O emission to the ratio of organic materials to synthetic fertilizers, and (3) evaluate the relationship between the NUE and yield-scaled N2O emissions. Field measurements were conducted within long- and short-term fertilization experiments between the years of 2014 and 2016. Treatments included synthetic fertilizers, synthetic fertilizers plus crop residues, and synthetic fertilizers plus dairy manure at both sites. The annual grain yields and N2O emissions varied from 13.3 to 18.0 Mg ha(-1) and from 1.3 to 3.6 kg N ha(-1), respectively, across the treatments. The yield-scaled N2O emissions related negatively to the NUE, suggesting that agronomic aims of improving NUE are an effective approach to mitigate N2O emissions. The ratio of organic materials to synthetic fertilizers was not a significant limit on the NUE and yield-scaled N2O emissions. We conclude that organic amendments appeared to play a minor influence on the promotion of the NUE and N2O mitigation.

AB Contemporary agriculture is shifting from a single-goal to a multi-goal strategy, which in turn requires choosing best management practice (BMP) based on an assessment of the biogeochemical effects of management alternatives. The bottleneck is the capacity of predicting the simultaneous effects of different management practice scenarios on multiple goals and choosing BMP among scenarios. The denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model may provide an opportunity to solve this problem. We validated the DNDC model (version 95) using the observations of soil moisture and temperature, crop yields, aboveground biomass and fluxes of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) from a wheat-maize cropping site in northern China. The model performed well for these variables. Then we used this model to simulate the effects of management practices on the goal variables of crop yields, NO emission, nitrate leaching, NH3 volatilization and net emission of greenhouse gases in the ecosystem (NEGE). Results showed that no-till and straw-incorporated practices had beneficial effects on crop yields and NEGE. Use of nitrification inhibitors decreased nitrate leaching and N2O and NO emissions, but they significantly increased NH3 volatilization. Irrigation based on crop demand significantly increased crop yield and decreased nitrate leaching and NH3 volatilization. Crop yields were hardly decreased if nitrogen dose was reduced by 15% or irrigation water amount was reduced by 25 %. Two methods were used to identify BMP and resulted in the same BMP, which adopted the current crop cultivar, field operation schedules and full straw incorporation and applied nitrogen and irrigation water at 15 and 25% lower rates, respectively, than the current use. Our study indicates that the DNDC model can be used as a tool to assess biogeochemical effects of management alternatives and identify BMP.

AB Soil dinitrogen (N-2) emissions are a key nitrogen loss pathway of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the quantification of field N-2 emissions from terrestrial ecosystems remains challenging, as sensitive field methods for measuring N-2 fluxes are lacking. Here, we report a new approach to quantify field N-2 emissions by (i) param-eterizing the molar ratio of nitrous oxide (N2O) to N2O plus N-2 emissions (RN2O) in the laboratory and (ii) measuring field N2O emissions and soil factors. Soil samples were taken from a maize field and incubated in the laboratory under simulated field conditions. Soil N-2 and N2O emissions were determined using the gas-flow-soilcore method. The measurements revealed that the RN2O values were significantly higher (0.06-0.67) following urea fertilization and soil rewetting compared to those periods with no fertilization (0.03-0.08) (P < 0.01). A multivariate, nonlinear parameterization of RN z o against four easily measured soil factors (ammonia and nitrate concentrations, temperature, and moisture) (n = 20, r(2) = 0.92, P < 0.001) was developed. The seasonal N-2 emissions at the field scale were calculated by combining the laboratory-measured RN2O with the field-measured N2O emissions and the soil factors. Based on this approach, the cumulative emissions of N-2 and N-2 +N2O for the maize season were 7.2 +/- 2.8 and 9.6 +/- 2.1 (standard error) kg N ha(-1), respectively. Using a fixed RN2O, i.e., disregarding the temporal and spatial variability of RN2O, resulted in approximately 50%-70% lower estimates. Our study shows that a combination of field N2O and soil factors measurements and laboratory parameterization of RN2O allows field N-2 emissions from croplands to be constrained. With additional measurements, including other soil properties, the development of a generalized parameterization of RN2O may become feasible. This approach would allow for a better understanding of gaseous N losses from agricultural ecosystems.

TI Mitigating nitrous oxide emissions from a maize-cropping black soil in
   northeast China by a combination of reducing chemical N fertilizer
   application and applying manure in autumn

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils, mainly caused by chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs, are major sources of N2O in Chinese terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, attempts to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils by optimizing N applications are receiving increasing attention. Further, organic fertilizers are being increasingly used in China to improve crop production/quality and prevent or reduce soil degradation. However, organic and chemical fertilizers are often both applied in spring in northeast China, which promotes N2O emissions and may be sub-optimal. Therefore, we hypothesized that reducing applications of chemical fertilizer N and applying manure in autumn could be an effective strategy for mitigating N2O emissions from cropped soils in the region. To test this hypothesis, we established a field trial to investigate the effects of different combinations of chemical N fertilizer applications and animal manure in autumn on both N2O emissions and maize (Zea mays L.) grain yields in northeast China. The treatments, expressed as NxMy (where Nx and My denote the total amounts of chemical fertilizer nitrogen (N) and manure (M) applied in kg N ha(-1) and m(3)Mha(-1), respectively), were N0M0, N230M0, N270M12, N230M15, N320M18 in 2010 and N0M0, N230M0, N200M12, N200M15, N280M18 in 2011. Measurements of the resulting N2O emissions showed that pulse fluxes occurred after each chemical N fertilizer application, but not after manure inputs in autumn or during soil-thawing periods in the following spring. Emission factors for the chemical fertilizer N were on average 1.07% (1.001.10%) and 1.14% (0.491.83%) in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Furthermore, by comparing the nine pairs of fertilization treatments, the relative increase in cumulative nitrous oxide-nitrogen (N2O-N) emissions was found to be proportional to the relative increase in urea application, but independent of the amount of autumn-applied manure. These findings imply that N2O emissions from fertilized agricultural soils in northeast China could be mitigated by supplying manure in the autumn and reducing the total amount of chemical N fertilizer applied in the following year. Although no significant difference in maize grain yield was found among the fertilization treatments, the grain yield-scaled N2O emissions for the treatments with a lower chemical N application (e.g., N230M15 and N200M15 treatments) were significantly lower than those with a higher chemical N application (e.g., N320M18 and N280M18 treatments). Meanwhile, under the condition of the same application amount of chemical fertilizer N, the grain yield-scaled N2O emission decreased with the increase of manure application rate. Thus, the results support the hypothesis that combining reductions in chemical N fertilizer and applying manure in autumn could be an effective strategy for mitigating N2O emissions from N-fertilized soils in northeast China.

AB Agricultural soils may account for 10% of anthropogenic emissions of NO, a precursor of tropospheric ozone with potential impacts on air quality and global warming. However, the estimation of this biogenic source strength and its relationships to crop management is still challenging because of the spatial and temporal variability of the NO fluxes.
   Here, we present a combination of new laboratory- and field-scale methods to characterise NO emissions and single out the effects of environmental drivers.
   First, NO fluxes were continuously monitored over the growing season of a maize-cropped field located near Paris (France), using 6 automatic chambers. Mineral fertilizer nitrogen was applied from May to October 2005. An additional field experiment was carried out in October to test the effects of N fertilizer form on the NO emissions. The automatic chambers were designed to measure simultaneously the NO and N(2)O gases. Laboratory measurements were carried out in parallel using soil cores sampled at same site to test the response of NO fluxes to varying soil N-NH(4) and water contents, and temperatures. The effects of soil core thickness were also analysed.
   The highest NO fluxes occurred during the first 5 weeks following fertilizer application. The cumulative loss of NO-N over the growing season was estimated at 1.5 kg N ha(-1), i.e. 1.1% of the N fertilizer dose (140 kg N ha(-1)). All rainfall events induced NO peak fluxes, whose magnitude decreased over time in relation to the decline of soil inorganic N. In October, NO emissions were enhanced with ammonium forms of fertilizer N. Conversely, the application of nitrate-based fertilizers did not significantly increase NO emissions compared to an unfertilized control. The results of the subsequent laboratory experiments were in accordance with the field observations in magnitude and time variations. NO emissions were maximum with a water soil content of 15% (w w(-1)), and with a NH(4)-N content of 180 mg NH(4)-N kg soil(-1). The response of NO fluxes to soil temperature was fitted with two exponential functions, involving a Q(10) of 2.0 below 20 degrees C and a Q(10) of 1.4 above. Field and laboratory experiments indicated that most of the NO fluxes originated from the top 10 cm of soil. The characterisation of this layer in terms of mean temperature, NH(4) and water contents is thus paramount to explaining the variations of NO fluxes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Manure is known to increase soil N2O emissions by stimulating nitrification and denitrification processes. Our objective was to compare soil-surface N2O emissions following the application of liquid and solid dairy cattle manures to a loamy and a clay soil cropped to silage maize. Manures were applied in 2 consecutive years at rates equivalent to 150 kg total N ha(-1) and compared with a control treatment receiving an equivalent rate of synthetic N. Soil-surface N2O fluxes, soil temperature, and soil water, nitrate and ammonium contents were monitored weekly in manured and control plots. From 60 to 90% of seasonal N2O emissions occurred during the first 40 d following manure and synthetic fertilizer applications, indicating that outside that period one or several factors limited N2O emissions. The period of higher emissions following manure and fertilizer application corresponded with the period when soil mineral N contents were highest (up to 17 g NO3- -N m(-2)) and water-filled pore space (WFPS) was greater than 0.5 m(3) m(-3). The absence of significant N2O fluxes later in the growing season despite high WFPS levels indicated that the stimulating effect of organic and synthetic N additions on soil N2O production was relatively short-lived. Fertilization of silage maize with dairy cattle manure resulted in greater or equal N2O emissions than with synthetic N. This was observed despite lower overall soil mineral N contents in the manured plots, indicating that other factors affected by manure, possibly additional C substrates and enhanced soil respiration, resulted in greater denitrification and N2O production. Silage maize yields in the manured soils were lower than those receiving synthetic N, indicating that the N(2)Oemissions per kilogram of harvested biomass were greater for manures than for synthetic N. Our results also suggest that the main source of N2O was nitrification in the loam and denitrification in the clay soil. There was no clear difference in N2O emissions between liquid and solid manures. The variable effects of liquid and solid manure addition on soil N(2)Oemissions reported in the literature likely result from the variable composition of the manures themselves as well as from interactions with other factors such as soil environment and farming practices. A better characterization of the availability of manure C and N is required to assess the impact of manure application on soil N2O emissions under field conditions.

AB A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of the continuous application of organic and mineral N fertilizer on N2O and NO emissions under maize and wheat rotation on the North China Plain. This study included eight treatments: no fertilizer (control); mineral N fertilizer (Nmin) at a rate of 200 kg N ha(-1) per season; 50% mineral fertilizer N plus 50% cattle manure N (50% CM), 50% chicken manure N (50% FC) or 50% pig manure N (50% FP); 75% mineral fertilizer N plus 25% cattle manure N (25% CM), 25% chicken manure N (25% FC) or 25% pig manure N (25% FP). The annual N2O and NO emissions were 2.71 and 0.39 kg N ha(-1), respectively, under the Nmin treatment, with an emission factor of 0.50% for N2O and 0.07% for NO. Compared with the Nmin treatment, N2O emissions did not differ when 50% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (50% CM, 50% FC and 50% FP), while annual NO emissions were significantly reduced by 49.0% and 27.8% under 50% FC and 50% FP, respectively. In contrast, annual N2O emissions decreased by 21-38% compared to the Nmin treatment when 25% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP). Most of the reduction occurred during the maize season. The 25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP treatments had no effect on NO emissions compared to the Nmin treatment. There was no obvious difference in annual N2O and NO emissions among the organic manures at the same application rate, probably due to their similar C/N ratio. Replacing a portion of the mineral fertilizer N with organic fertilizer N did not significantly affect crop grain yield, except for the 50% FC treatment in the wheat season. Overall, the results suggest that the combined application of 25% organic manure N plus 75% mineral fertilizer N had the most potential to mitigate N2O emissions while not affecting crop yield in the maize and wheat rotation system in this area of China.

AB Substitution of conventional mineral fertilizers with organic sources can avoid the environmental problems associated with high concentrations of intensive livestock production in some Mediterranean areas. Some management practices, such as the use of nitrification inhibitors or more efficient irrigation techniques (e.g., drip irrigation), have been suggested as effective alternatives to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions released from soils amended with synthetic and organic fertilizers. In this experiment, we aimed to assess the effect of different organic amendments derived from pig manure (control without N fertilization (C); liquid fraction of pig slurry (LFPS); pig urine with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4 dimethylpyrazolephosphate (DMPP) (LFPSI); compost from the solid phase of pig slurry (COM)) compared to urea (U) and two different irrigation systems (the widespread sprinkler and alternative drip irrigation systems) on greenhouse gas (N2O, methane, CH4, and carbon dioxide, CO2) and NO emissions in a maize (Zea mays L.) crop. The effect of these treatments on crop yields and yield scaled N2O emissions were also evaluated. The use of DMPP with LFPS was an effective practice to reduce N2O and NO losses (40 and 32% mitigation, respectively, compared to LFPS alone), and was also associated with the highest rates of CH4 oxidation. Drip irrigation significantly reduced the global warming potential (in spite of a lower CH4 sink) but increased the NO losses by 58%, as opposed td sprinkler irrigation. The higher biomass production and similar grain yields observed with drip irrigatioh resulted in lower yield scaled N2O emissions in this treatment than in sprinkler irrigation. The use of organic fertilizers penalized grain yields compared to U (16-33%), although the differences were not significant in the case of LFPSI. Consequently, LFPSI in drip irrigation was (together with U applied by drip-fertigation) the treatment that led to the lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions. The use of organic N sources in irrigated maize is an environmentally advisable strategy in Mediterranean cropping systems, but an optimum balance between N oxides and greenhouse gas losses, N efficiency and crop yields requires the use of nitrification inhibitors (e.g., DMPP) with liquid organic sources.

AB Crop residues may serve as a significant source of soil emissions of N2O and other trace gases. According to the emission factors (EFs) set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), N2O emission is proportional to the amount of N added by residues to the soil. However, the effects of crop residues on the source and sink strength of agroecosystems for trace gases are regulated by their properties, such as the C and N content; C/N ratio; lignin, cellulose, and soluble fractions; and residue humidity. In the present study, an automated dynamic chamber method was used in combination with soil mesocosms to simultaneously measure the effects of nine different crop residues (oilseed rape, winter wheat, field pea, maize, potato, mustard, red clover, sugar beet, and iyegrass) on soil respiration (CO2) and reactive N fluxes (N2O, NO, and NH3 at a high temporal resolution. Specifically, crop residues were incorporated in the 0-4 cm topsoil layer and incubated for 60 days at a constant temperature (15 degrees C) and water-filled pore space (60% WFPS). Residue incorporation immediately and sharply increased soil N2O and CO2 emissions, but these were short-lived and returned to background levels within respectively 10 and 30 days. The magnitude of increase in soil NO flux following residue incorporation was lower than that in CO2 and N2O fluxes, with peak emissions observed around day 20. Overall, the N content or C/N ratio of the applied residue could not sufficiently explain the variation in soil N2O and NO emissions. The range of the calculated N2O EFs over a 60-day period was -0.17 to +45, being wider than that proposed by the IPCC -0.01 to +1.1). Therefore, the residue maturity stage may be used as a simple proxy to estimate the N2O + NO emissions from incorporated residue. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Biogenic fluxes from soil at a local and regional scale are crucial to study air pollution and climate. Here we present field measurements of soil fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) observed over four different land cover types, i.e. bare soil, grassland, maize field, and forest, at an inland rural site in Benin, West Africa, during the DACCIWA field campaign in June and July 2016. At the regional scale, urbanization and a massive growth in population in West Africa have been causing a strong increase in anthropogenic emissions. Anthropogenic pollutants are transported inland and northward from the megacities located on the coast, where the reaction with biogenic emissions may lead to enhanced ozone production outside urban areas, as well as secondary organic aerosol formation, with detrimental effects on humans, animals, natural vegetation, and crops. We observe NO fluxes up to 48.05 ngN m(-2) s(-1). NO fluxes averaged over all land cover types are 4.79 +/- 5.59 ngN m(-2) s(-1), and maximum soil emissions of NO are recorded over bare soil. NH3 is dominated by deposition for all land cover types. NH3 fluxes range between -6.59 and 4.96 ngN m(-2) s(-1). NH3 fluxes averaged over all land cover types are -0.91 +/- 1.27 ngN m(-2) s(-1), and maximum NH3 deposition is measured over bare soil. The observations show high spatial variability even for the same soil type, same day, and same meteorological conditions. We compare point daytime average measurements of NO emissions recorded during the field campaign with those simulated by GEOS-Chem (Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Model) for the same site and find good agreement. In an attempt to quantify NO emissions at the regional and national scale, we also provide a tentative estimate of total NO emissions for the entire country of Benin for the month of July using two distinct methods: upscaling point measurements and using the GEOS-Chem model. The two methods give similar results: 1.17 +/- 0.6 and 1.44 GgN month(-1), respectively. Total NH3 deposition estimated by upscaling point measurements for the month of July is 0.21 GgN month(-1).

AB Reactive nitrogen gas (Nr) originating from the soil is highly susceptible to the influence of agricultural water and fertilizer management practices, making it a critical gas that can substantially contribute to atmospheric pollution. Understanding the emission patterns of Nr in the surface soil under reclaimed water (RW) irrigation is essential for guiding RW irrigation practices and informing policies aimed at reducing Nr emissions. In this study conducted in Beijing, North China, field sites were selected with different irrigation management strategies and corresponding fertilizer application methods. The two types of irrigation water quality comprised RW irrigation and groundwater (UW) irrigation, whereas the two fertilizer types utilized were calcium ammonium nitrate with a high nitrate nitrogen content and ammonium sulfate with ammonium nitrogen. Nr emissions and concentrations in the soil profile (0-30 cm depth) were monitored throughout key agricultural events, including cultivation, irrigation, fertilization, and harvest, spanning the period from 2020 to 2021. It is observed that RW irrigation effectively reduces cumulative ammonia (NH3) emissions compared to groundwater (UW) treatment. However, it results in increased concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) (12.33%-73.82%) and nitric oxide (NO) (13.74%-36.59%) in the soil within the depth range of 0-30 cm. Of particular importance is the notable increase in the abundance of soil denitrifying and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA-amoA) genes due to RW irrigation, indicating the potential for elevated N2O and NO emissions. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the soil Nr emissions and concentrations are more strongly affected by nitrogen type rather than water quality. Conversely, the inclusion of nitrate has proven to be effective in mitigating N2O and NO emissions in RW-irrigated farmland.

AB Annual nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from high-altitude alpine meadow grasslands have not been effectively characterized because of the scarcity of whole-year measurements. The authors performed a year-round measurement of N2O fluxes from three conventionally grazed alpine meadows that represent the typical meadow landscape in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The results showed that annual N2O emissions averaged 0.123 +/- 0.053 (2SD, i.e., the double standard deviation indicating the 95% confidence interval) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) across the three meadow sites. N2O flux pulses during the spring freezing-thawing period (FTP) were observed at only one site, indicating a large spatial variability in association with soil moisture differences. Approximately 34-57% (mean: 46%) of the annual N2O emissions occurred in the non-growing season, highlighting the substantial importance of accurate flux observations during this period. The simultaneous observations showed conservative, marginal nitric oxide (NO) fluxes of 0.058 +/- 0.032 (2SD) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The N2O fluxes across the three field sites correlated negatively with the soil nitrate concentrations during the entire year-round period (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a significant joint regulatory effect of topsoil temperature and moisture on the N2O and NO fluxes was observed during the relatively warm periods. Based on the results of the present and previous studies, a simple extrapolation roughly estimated the annual total N2O emission from Chinese grasslands to be 73 +/- 15 (2SD) Gg N yr(-1) (1 Gg = 10(9) g). A linear dependence of the annual N2O fluxes on the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was also found. This result may provide a simple approach for estimating the N2O emission inventories of frigid alpine or temperate grasslands that are ungrazed either in the summer or year round. However, further confirmation of this relationship with a wider ANPP range is still needed in the future studies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Nonlinear response of nitric oxide fluxes to fertilizer inputs and the

AB Crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa remain stagnant at 1 ton ha(-1), and 260 million people lack access to adequate food resources. Order-of-magnitude increases in fertilizer use are seen as a critical step in attaining food security. This increase represents an unprecedented input of nitrogen (N) to African ecosystems and will likely be accompanied by increased soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO). NO is a precursor to tropospheric ozone, an air pollutant and greenhouse gas. Emissions of NO from soils occur primarily during denitrification and nitrification, and N input rates are a key determinant of emission rates. We established experimental maize plots in western Kenya to allow us to quantify the response function relating NO flux to N input rate during the main 2011 and 2012 growing seasons. NO emissions followed a sigmoid response to fertilizer inputs and have emission factors under 1% for the roughly two-month measurement period in each year, although linear and step relationships could not be excluded in 2011. At fertilization rates above 100 kg N ha(-1), NO emissions increased without a concomitant increase in yields. We used the GEOS-CHEM chemical transport model to evaluate local impacts of increased NO emissions on tropospheric ozone concentrations. Mean 4-hour afternoon tropospheric ozone concentrations in Western Kenya increased by up to roughly 2.63 ppbv under fertilization rates of 150 kg N ha(-1) or higher. Using AOT40, a metric for assessing crop damage from ozone, we find that the increased ozone concentrations result in an increase in AOT40 exposure of approximately 110 ppbh for inputs of 150 kg N ha(-1) during the March-April-May crop growing season, compared with unfertilized simulations, with negligible impacts on crop productivity. Our results suggest that it may be possible to manage Kenyan agricultural systems for high yields while avoiding substantial impacts on air quality.

AB N2O and NO emissions from a winter wheat-summer maize rotation field in the North China Plain were comparably investigated under three different treatments: 1) flood irrigation (A-Flood treatment) plus fertilization of NH4Cl, 2) drip fertigation (A-Drip treatment) plus fertilization of NH4Cl and 3) drip fertigation (AN-Drip treatment) plus fertilization of a mixture of Ca(NO3)(2) and NH4Cl. The annual N2O cumulative emissions from the A-Drip treatment and the A-Flood treatment were almost identical, whereas it from the AN-Drip treatment was significantly lower (33%) than that from the A-Flood treatment. Compared with the A-Flood treatment, the annual NO cumulative emission from the A-Drip treatment was significantly increased by 140% but it from the AN-Drip treatment was only slightly increased by 14%. Compared with drip fertigation with NH4Cl, drip fertigation with the mixture of Ca(NO3)(2) and NH4Cl significantly reduced the cumulative emissions of N2O (31%) and NO (52%) from the nitrification dominated fields by decreasing the supplement of NH4+ substrate. Among the three fertilization treatments, the yields of the maize from the A-Drip and AN-Drip treatments were significantly increased, while the yields of the wheat were almost the same. Considering the benefit of increasing yields and reducing N fertilizer and water input, the application of nitrate-based fertilizer instead of partial ammonium-based fertilizer through drip fertigation could be a promising method for keeping agronomic productivity and environmental sustainability.

TI Responses of N2O and CH4 fluxes to fertilizer

AB Model and field studies generally posit that when the application rates of nitrogen fertilizer exceed crop needs, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions will increase nonlinearly, though linear responses are also extensively reported by field studies. We conducted year-round measurements of crop yield, N2O and methane (CH4) fluxes for treatments of six fertilizer nitrogen levels (0, 135, 270, 430, 650 and 850 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the form of urea) in a typical irrigated wheat-maize rotation field in northern China. Linear models characterized the responses of cumulative N2O emissions to fertilizer rates well; therefore, the calculated N2O emission factors of 0.17 +/- 0.02%, 0.73 +/- 0.05% and 0.49 +/- 0.02% for the wheat season, maize season and annual scale, respectively, were appropriate for the different fertilizer rates. The cumulative CH4 uptake by the soil tended to be enhanced at higher fertilizer rates (>= 350 kg N ha(-1)) in the maize season whereas no effect was observed for the wheat season. When the annual fertilizer rates increased from 270 to 430, from 270 to 650, and from 270 to 850 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), the crop yields increased only 3 similar to 15% (0.5 similar to 2.1 t ha(-1) yr(-1)), but cumulative N2O emissions increased 35 similar to 115% (0.9 similar to 3.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). We recommend 270 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as the locally optimum fertilizer rate. Considering the nitrogen inputs by fertilization (270 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), irrigation (4.3 +/- 0.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and deposition (wet deposition: 30.5 +/- 1.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), the slightly positive soil nitrogen balance could maintain the current crop yield (similar to 13.8 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) and reduce the present high N2O emissions (>3.51 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) of the local farmers' practice (fertilizer rate > 430 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)).

AB Topography affects soil hydrological, pedological, and biochemical processes and may influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions into the atmosphere. While N2O emissions from agricultural fields are mainly measured at plot scale and on flat topography, intrafield topographical and crop growth variability alter soil processes and might impact N2O emissions. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of topographical variations on crop growth period dependent soil N2O emissions at the field scale. A field experiment was conducted at two agricultural farms (Baggs farm; BF and Research North; RN) with undulating topography. Dominant slope positions (upper, middle, lower and toeslope) were identified based on elevation difference. Soil and gas samples were collected from four replicated locations within each slope position over the whole corn growing season (May-October 2019) to measure soil physio-chemical properties and N2O emissions. The N2O emissions at BF ranged from -0.27 +/- 0.42 to 255 +/- 105 g ha(-1) d(-1). Higher cumulative emissions were observed from the upper slope (1040 +/- 487 g ha(-1)) during early growing season and from the toeslope (371 +/- 157 g ha(-1)) during the late growing season with limited variations during the mid growing season. Similarly, at RN farm, (emissions ranged from -0.50 +/- 0.83 to 70 +/- 15 g ha(-1) d(-1)), the upper slope had higher cumulative emissions during early (576 +/- 132 g ha(-1)) and mid (271 +/- 51 g ha(-1)) growing season, whereas no impact of slope positions was observed during late growing season. Topography controlled soil and environmental properties differently at different crop growth periods; thus, intrafield variability must be considered in estimating N2O emissions and emission factor calculation from agricultural fields. However, due to large spatial variations in N2O emissions, further explorations into site-specific analysis of individual soil properties and their impact on N2O emissions using multiyear data might help to understand and identify hotspots of N2O emissions.

AB Gaseous reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions from agricultural soils to the atmosphere constitute an integral part of global N cycle, directly or indirectly causing climate change impacts. The extensive use of N fertilizer in crop production will compromise our efforts to reduce agricultural Nr emissions in China. A national inventory of fertilizer N-induced gaseous Nr emissions from croplands in China remains to be developed to reveal its role in shaping climate change. Here we present a data-driven estimate of fertilizer N-induced soil Nr emissions based on regional and crop-specific emission factors (EFs) compiled from 379 manipulative studies. In China, agricultural soil Nr emissions from the use of synthetic N fertilizer and manure in 2018 are estimated to be 3.81 and 0.73 Tg N yr(-1), with a combined contribution of 23%, 20% and 15% to the global agricultural emission total of ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO), respectively. Over the past three decades, NH3 volatilization from croplands has experienced a shift from a rapid increase to a decline trend, whereas N2O and NO emissions always maintain a strong growth momentum due to a robust and continuous rise of EFs. Regionally, croplands in Central south (1.51 Tg N yr(-1)) and East (0.99 Tg N yr(-1)) of China exhibit as hotspots of soil Nr emissions. In terms of crop-specific emissions, rice, maize and vegetable show as three leading Nr emitters, together accounting for 61% of synthetic N fertilizer-induced Nr emissions from croplands. The global warming effect derived from cropland N2O emissions in China was found to dominate over the local cooling effects of NH3 and NO emissions. Our established regional and crop-specific EFs for gaseous Nr forms provide a new benchmark for constraining the IPCC Tier 1 default EF values. The spatio-temporal insight into soil Nr emission data from N fertilizer application in our estimate is expected to advance our efforts towards more accurate global or regional cropland Nr emission inventories and effective mitigation strategies.

AB Lands under riparian and agricultural management differ in soil properties, water content, plant species and nutrient content and are therefore expected to influence denitrifier communities, denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Denitrifier community abundance, denitrifier community structure, denitrification gene expression and activity were quantified on three dates in a maize field and adjacent riparian zone. N2O emissions were greater in the agricultural zone, whereas complete denitrification to N-2 was greater in the riparian zone. In general, the targeted denitrifier community abundance did not change between agricultural and riparian zones. However, nosZ gene expression was greater in the riparian zone than the agricultural zone. The community structure of nirS-gene-bearing denitrifiers differed in June only, whereas the nirK-gene-bearing community structure differed significantly between the riparian and the agricultural zones at all dates. The nirK-gene-bearing community structure was correlated with soil pH, while no significant correlations were found between nirS-gene-bearing community structure and soil environmental variables or N2O emissions, denitrification or denitrifier enzyme activity. The results suggested for the nirK and nirS-gene-bearing communities different factors control abundance vs. community structure. The nirK-gene-bearing community structure was also more responsive than the nirS-gene-bearing community structure to change between the two ecosystems.

AB Nitrification inhibitors, originally proposed for nitrate leaching mitigation, are recommended as effective nitrous oxide (N2O) mitigation strategies. Several compounds have been trialled and used in the past including dicyandiamide (DCD) or 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Yet, little is known about the new nitrification inhibitor 2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA). A field experiment using N-15 single-labelled ammonium nitrate ((NH4NO3)-N-15 or (NH4NO3)-N-15) was conducted to understand the effectiveness of DMPSA on a biochemical basis in an irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) crop. Gaseous fluxes, i.e. N2O, (N2O)-N-15, N-15(2), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) were measured, as well as soil mineral N, yield components and N-15 recovery in plant and soil. During the maize cropping period, the use of DMPSA significantly reduced cumulative N2O emissions (118 g N ha(-1)) compared to ammonium nitrate without inhibitor (231 g N ha(-1)). The N-15 analyses revealed that most N2O losses (particularly during the emission peak) came from (NH4NO3)-N-15 (i.e. nitrification, nitrifier denitrification and/or coupled nitrification denitrification) rather than (NH4NO3)-N-15 in this calcareous low C-content soil. As expected, DMPSA decreased N2O losses from (NH4+)-N-15 oxidation, but an effect on non-target microorganisms was noticed, as shown by the significant reduction of respiration rates and N2O losses coming from (NO3-)-N-15. No significant effect of DMPSA on CH4 oxidation or N-15(2) fluxes was observed. The DMPSA did not lead to a significant improvement of the dry weights of grain or biomass, although an increment of root biomass by 64% was found. This compound also tended to increase plant N recovery (average 67.8%) and to decrease soil N recovery (average 18.3%) but differences were not statistically significant. Conversely, the nitrification inhibitor significantly reduced the residual fertilizer-N in the 15-30 cm and 30-45 cm soil layers. The use of DMPSA was confirmed as a highly effective tool to reduce N2O emissions from irrigated crops in semi-arid areas.

AB Urea has become the predominant source of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer used throughout the world. Among the various available mitigation tools, urease inhibitors like NBPT have the most potential to improve efficiency of urea by reducing N losses, mainly via ammonia volatilization. However, there is a lack of information on the effect of N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBFT) on other N losses such as gaseous emissions of N2O and NO and NO3- leaching. A two-year field experiment using irrigated maize (Zea mays) crop was carried out under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effectiveness of urea coated with NBPT (0.4%, w/w) alone and with both NBPT and nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) (0.4 and 3%, w/w, respectively) to mitigate N2O-N, NO-N and NO3--N losses. The different treatments of U, U+NBPT and U+NBPT+DCD were applied to the maize crop in 2009 and then in 2010. The 2010 maize crop followed a fallow period, during which the 2009 crop residues were incorporated into the soil. Two different irrigation regimes were followed each year. In 2009, irrigation was controlled for the first 2 weeks following urea fertilization; whereas, the 2010 crop period was characterized by increased irrigation in the same period. After each treatment application, measurements of the changes in soil mineral N, gaseous emissions of N2O and NO, nitrate leaching and biomass production were made. N2O emissions were effectively abated by NBPT and NBPT+DCD and were reduced by 54 and 24%, respectively, in 2009. A reduction in nitrification rate by the inhibitors was also observed during 2009. In 2010 cropping period, NBPT reduced N2O emissions by 4%; while the combination of NBPT and DCD treatment reduced N2O emission by 43%. Yield-scaled N2O emissions were reduced by 50 and 18% by NBPT and the mixture of NBPT+DCD, respectively, in 2009. Applying inhibitors did not have any significant effect on yieldscaled N2O emissions in the 2010 crop period. Total NO losses from urea were 2.25 kg NO-N ha(-1) in the 2009 crop period and 5 times lower in the following year; this may provide an indicator of the prevalence of nitrification as the main process in the production of N2O in the 2009 maize crop. Most of the NO3- was lost within the fallow period (i.e. 92,81 and 75% of the total NO3- leached for U, U+NBPT and U+NBPT+DCD, respectively), so the incorporation of crop residues was not as effective as expected at reducing these N losses. Our study suggests that the effectiveness of NBFT and combination of NBPT+DCD in reducing N losses from applied urea is influenced by management practices, such as irrigation, and climatic conditions.

AB Agricultural fields are significant sources of anthropogenic atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). We compiled and analyzed data on N2O emissions from Japanese agricultural fields (246 measurements from 36 sites) reported in peer-reviewed journals and research reports. Agricultural fields were classified into three categories: upland fields, tea fields and rice paddy fields. In this analysis, data measured over a period of more than 90 days for upland fields and 209 days for tea fields were used to estimate annual fertilizer-induced emission factors (EF) because of limitations in the available data. The EF is defined as the emission from fertilized plots minus the background emission (emission from a zero-N control plot), and is expressed as a percentage of the N applied. The mean of N2O emissions from upland fields with well-drained soils was significantly lower than that from poorly drained soils. Mean (+/- standard deviation) N2O emissions measured over a period of more than 90 days from fertilized upland fields were 1.03 +/- 1.14 kg N ha(-1) and 4.78 +/- 5.36 kg N ha(-1) for well-drained and poorly drained soils, respectively. Because the ratio of the total areas of well-drained soils and poorly drained soils was different from the ratio of the number of available EF data for each soil category, we used a weighted mean to estimate EF for all upland fields. The EF was estimated to be 0.62 +/- 0.48% for all fertilized upland fields. Mean N2O emissions and the estimated EF for fertilized tea fields measured over a period of more than 209 days were 24.3 +/- 16.3 kg N ha(-1) and 2.82 +/- 1.80%, respectively. The mean N2O emission and estimated EF from Japanese rice paddy fields were 0.36 kg N ha(-1) and 0.31 +/- 0.31% for the cropping season, respectively. Significant uncertainties remain in these results because of limitations in the available data.

AB Nitrogen (N) fertilization and straw incorporation strongly influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural fields. An in-situ micro-plot experiment on intensively farmed winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted to investigate the source and rate of N2O emissions from soils following labeled N-15 fertilization with and without straw incorporation. Four treatments, i.e., no N fertilizer and no straw incorporation (N0S0), straw incorporation only (N0S1), N fertilizer only (N1S0), and N fertilization plus straw incorporation (N1S1), were established in the experiment. The N2O emissions mainly occurred after N fertilization and lasted for approximately 1-2 weeks, accounting for 60%-67% of the wheat seasonal N2O emissions. Within the 6 days after basal fertilization and 2-4 days after top-dressing, most of the N2O fluxes (> 50%) were derived from fertilizer. Thereafter, soil-derived N2O dominated the total N2O emissions and within 10-20 days after N fertilization, fertilizer-derived N2O became negligible. Fertilizer N and soil N both accounted for 40%-60% of the seasonal N2O emissions, which may be explained by the high soil N stock due to long-term high N fertilization in the region. This implies the similar roles of soil N pool and fertilizer N in N2O generation under intensively farmed soils. The N fertilization had a significant priming effect on the turnover of soil N, which contributed 21.02%-50.47% of the total N2O emissions. During the basal fertilization/first irrigation event, straw incorporation significantly (P < 0.05) stimulated CO2 fluxes both in N-fertilized and non-N-fertilized plots; however, after the top-dressing/second irrigation event, the significant increase of CO2 fluxes induced by straw incorporation was only observed in the N-fertilized treatment. Straw incorporation interacted with N fertilization, and tended to enhance N2O emissions in the basal fertilization and lower N2O emissions in the top-dressing period. In N-fertilized plots, the seasonal N2O emissions from straw-incorporated and straw-removed treatments were similar, indicating that straw incorporation enhanced the N supply without increasing the N2O emissions. Our study highlights that there are significant benefits of straw incorporation to soil fertility improvement; however, the long-term impacts of straw incorporation on greenhouse gas emissions should be further examined.

AB Balancing efforts to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from crop production while increasing grain yields is an important challenge for agriculture. The objectives of this study were to assess N2O emissions, soil inorganic nitrogen (N) concentrations, grain yield, and grain N content for three enhanced-efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs) compared with anhydrous ammonia in a rainfed corn system in Illinois over 3 yr (2015-2017). Treatments included a control (check) and four N sources applied at 202 kg N ha(-1): injected anhydrous ammonia, stabilized urea containing urease and nitrification inhibitors (SuperU, Agrotain International), polymer-coated urea (ESN, Agrium Advanced Technologies), and injected urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) + nitrapyrin. Significant reductions in N2O emissions were observed for several EENFs compared with anhydrous ammonia, but results were not consistent across treatments and years. SuperU reduced area-and yield-scaled N2O emissions in two of three study years compared with anhydrous ammonia, while ESN had no N2O mitigation benefit. Injected UAN + nitrapyrin had the highest emissions in the first year but significantly decreased emissions in the second 2 yr. No treatment significantly improved yield or grain N content compared with anhydrous ammonia. In light of efforts to broadly promote EENFs in the US Midwest, these results demonstrate there is some promise for N2O mitigation, but the lack of clear crop productivity benefits combined with inconsistent N2O mitigation effects do not support the conclusion that EENFs inherently improve agronomic and environmental outcomes.

AB The fate of the added N on a sandy loam soil was determined in an improved fallow-maize sequence field experiment in Zimbabwe. Pre-season mineral N was determined in 20 cm sections to 120 cm depth by soil auguring in seven land use systems. Thereafter, sequential soil auguring was done at two-week intervals in plots that previously had 2-year fallows of Acacia angustissima, Sesbania sesban and unfertilized maize to determine mineral N dynamics. Using the static chamber technique, N(2)O fluxes were also determined in the same plots. Pre-season NH(4)-N concentrations were > 12 kg N ha(-1) in the 0-20 cm layer for treatments that had a pronounced litter layer. NO(3)-N concentrations below 60 cm depth were <3 kg N ha(-1) layer(-1) for Sesban, Acacia, Cajanus cajan and natural woodland compared with > 10 kg N ha(-1) layer(-1) in the control plots where maize had been cultivated each year. There was a flush of NO3-N in the Sesbania and Acacia plots with the first rains. Topsoil NO3-N had increased to > 29 kg N ha(-1) by the time of establishing the maize crop. This increase in NO3-N in the topsoil was not sustained as concentrations decreased rapidly within three weeks of maize planting, to amounts of 8.6 kg N ha(-1) and 11.2 kg N ha(-1) for the Sesbania and Acacia plots, respectively. Total NO3-N leaching losses from the 0-40 cm layer ranged from 29-40 kg ha(-1) for Sesbania and Acacia plots within two weeks when 104 mm rainfall was received to an already fully recharged soil profile. Nitrate then accumulated below the 40 cm depth during early season when the maize had not developed a sufficient root length density to effectively capture nutrients. At one week after planting maize, N(2)O fluxes of 12.3 g N(2)O-N ha(-1) day(-1) from Sesbania plots were about twice as high as those from Acacia, and about seven times the 1.6 g N(2)O-N ha(-1) day(-1) from maize monoculture. This was at the time when mineral N was at its peak in the topsoil. The unfertilized maize showed consistently low N(2)O emissions, which never exceeded 2 g N(2)O-N ha(-1) day(-1) for all the eight sampling dates. The decrease of mineral N concentration in the topsoil resulted in reduced N(2)O fluxes, despite very high soil moisture conditions. Total N(2)O-N emissions were greatest for Sesbania plots with 0.3 kg ha(-1) lost in 56 days. We conclude that, under high rainfall conditions, there is an inherent problem in managing mineral N originating from mineralization of organic materials as it accumulates at the onset of rains, and is susceptible to leaching before the crop root system develops. We did not quantify nitric oxide and N(2) gas emissions, but it is unlikely that total gaseous N losses would be significant and contribute to poor N recovery that has been widely reported.

AB We studied the effect of crop residues with various C:N ratios on N2O emissions from soil. We set up five experimental plots with four types of crop residues, onion leaf (OL), soybean stem and leaf (SSL), rice straw (RS) and wheat straw (WS), and no residue (NR) on Gray Lowland soil in Mikasa, Hokkaido, Japan. The C:N ratios of these crop residues were 11.6, 14.5, 62.3, and 110, respectively. Based on the results of a questionnaire survey of farmer practices, we determined appropriate application rates: 108, 168, 110, 141 and 0 g C m(-2) and 9.3, 11.6, 1.76, 1.28 and 0 g N m(-2), respectively. We measured N2O, CO2 and NO fluxes using a closed chamber method. At the same time, we measured soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm, water-filled pore space (WFPS), and the concentrations of soil NH4+-N, NO3--N and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC). Significant peaks of N2O and CO2 emissions came from OL and SSL just after application, but there were no emissions from RS, WS or NR. There was a significant relationship between N2O and CO2 emissions in each treatment except WS, and correlations between CO2 flux and temperature in RS, soil NH4+-N and N2O flux in SSL and NR, soil NH4+-N and CO2 flux in SSL, and WSOC and CO2 flux in WS. The ratio of N2O-N/NO-N increased to approximately 100 in OL and SSL as N2O emissions increased. Cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions increased as the C:N ratio decreased, but not significantly. The ratio of N2O emission to applied N ranged from -0.43% to 0.86%, and was significantly correlated with C:N ratio (y = -0.59 ln [x] + 2.30, r(2) = 0.99, P < 0.01). The ratio of CO2 emissions to applied C ranged from -5.8% to 45% and was also correlated with C:N ratio, but not significantly (r(2) = 0.78, P = 0.11).

AB Nitrogen (N) stabilizers such as urease inhibitors (UI) and nitrification inhibitors (NI) are promising tools to mitigate N losses from fertilized soils. To better understand the efficacy of UI and NI, a 2-year field trial was carried out in the North China Plain (NCP) to analyze the impact of UI and NI on NH3 loss and N transformations following urea fertilizer application. Additionally, a laboratory study using an automated continuous-flow incubation system was conducted under controlled conditions, using the same soil, to evaluate the mitigation potential of the N stabilizers on NO, N2O and CO2 emission. The results showed that a novel UI product, Limus (R) (BASF, Germany), containing active ingredients N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) and N-(n-propyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NPPT), limited ammonium formation rate and reduced NH3 loss in both maize (by 85 and 96% for year 1 and 2, respectively) and wheat (by 41 and 64%, for year 1 and 2, respectively) seasons. The 3, 4-dimethypyrazole phosphate (DMPP) amendment significantly retarded nitrate formation rate but the effectiveness was compromised by high ambient temperature; additionally, the NI amendment increased NH3 emission (by 16 and 24% for maize and wheat year 2, respectively). In the laboratory incubation experiment, addition of the UI reduced emissions of NO, N2O and CO2 by 89, 73 and 19%, respectively, while the addition of the NI reduced the respective emissions by 95, 83 and 24% over the 16 d incubation period. These results suggest that N stabilizers can play a significant role in the mitigation of the environmental impacts of intensive agriculture, and, in particular, that the UI amendment may have the better potential to reduce N losses in the climatic and soil conditions of the NCP, and that the NI should be avoided under high ambient temperatures.

AB NOX fluxes from three kinds of vegetable lands and a rice field were measured during summer-autumn in the Yangtze Delta, China. The average NO fluxes from the rice fields (RF), celery field (CE), maize field (MA) and cowpea field (CP) were 4.1, 30.8, 54 and 32.2 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively; and the average NO2 fluxes were -2.12, 0.68, 1.33 and 0.5 ng N m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The liquid N fertilizer (the mixture of swine excrement and urine) which is widely applied to vegetable lands by Chinese farmers was found to quickly stimulate NO emission, and have significant contribution to NO emission from the investigated vegetable lands. Apparent linearity correlations were found between NO2 fluxes and the ambient concentrations of the rice fields, with a compensation point of about 2.84 mu g m(-3). Total emissions of NO during summer-autumn time from this area were roughly estimated to be 4.1 and 8.4 Gg N for rice field and vegetable lands, respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To evaluate the impact of N placement depth and no-till (NT) practice on the emissions of NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 from soils, we conducted two N placement experiments in a long-term tillage experiment site in northeastern Colorado in 2004. Trace gas flux measurements were made 2-3 times per week, in zero-N fertilizer plots that were cropped continuously to corn (Zea mays L.) under conventional-till (CT) and NT. Three N placement depths, replicated four times (5, 10 and 15 cm in Exp. 1 and 0, 5 and 10 cm in Exp. 2, respectively) were used. Liquid urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN, 224 kg N ha(-1)) was injected to the desired depth in the CT- or NT-soils in each experiment. Mean flux rates of NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 ranged from 3.9 to 5.2 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), 60.5 to 92.4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), -0.8 to 0.5 mu g C m(-2) h(-1), and 42.1 to 81.7 mg C m(-2) h(-1) in both experiments, respectively. Deep N placement (10 and 15 cm) resulted in lower NO and N2O emissions compared with shallow N placement (0 and 5 cm) while CH4 and CO2 emissions were not affected by N placement in either experiment. Compared with N placement at 5 cm, for instance, averaged N2O emissions from N placement at 10 cm were reduced by more than 50% in both experiments. Generally, NT decreased NO emission and CH4 oxidation but increased N2O emissions compared with CT irrespective of N placement depths. Total net global warming potential (GWP) for N2O, CH4 and CO2 was reduced by deep N placement only in Exp. 1 but was increased by NT in both experiments. The study results suggest that deep N placement (e.g., 10 cm) will be an effective option for reducing N oxide emissions and GWP from both fertilized CT- and NT-soils.

AB Tillage changes soil environmental conditions and controls the distribution of residues in the soil, both actions that affect the production and emission of soil biogenic gases (CO2, N2O, and CH4). The objective of this study was to determine how tillage-induced environmental conditions and substrate quality affect the mineralization rate of easily metabolizable compounds and the subsequent production of these gases. Carbon compounds, with and without nitrogen, were applied to soil cropped to maize under tilled and no-till systems. Following substrate application in the spring and summer, biogenic gases were measured periodically at the soil surface (flux) and within the profile (concentration) at 10-, 20-, and 30-cm depths (i.e., within, at the bottom of, and below the plough layer). Strong CO2 and N2O responses to sucrose and glycine in both the field and the laboratory indicate that the soil was C- and N-limited. Surface fluxes of CO2 and N2O were greater in soils amended with glycine than with sucrose and were greater in tilled than no-till soils. Transient emission of CH4 following the addition of glycine was observed and could be attributed to inhibition of N mineralization and nitrification processes on CH4 oxidation. Laboratory and field measurements indicated that the larger substrate-induced CO2 emission from the tilled soils could not be attributed to differences in the total biomass or the basal respiratory activity of the soils. Thus, there appears to be no underlying difference in the functional capacity of the microbial communities under different tillage regimes. Comparison of gas profiles indicates relative accumulation of CO2 at depth in soils under no-till, as well as greater decline in profile CO2 content with time in the tilled compared to the no-till soil. These results support the conclusion that greater CO2 efflux from the tilled soils resulted from more rapid gas diffusion through the profile. Hence, the observed differences in gas fluxes between tilled and no-till soils can be attributed to differences in physical environment. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In a study on the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from maize production in South-West Germany, N2O emissions where measured with an automated chamber system over two consecutive cropping seasons, including an intermediate fallow period. Urea-based fertilizer treatments included a fertilizer only control (U), as well as the use of pyraclostrobin, which showed inhibitory effects on denitrification in a laboratory experiment. Pyraclostrobin was used alone (U + P) and in combination with a NBPT/NPPT urease inhibitor (UI + P) and a reduced fertilizer rate (70% UI + P). The U control emitted 1.03 +/- 0.22 and 1.94 +/- 0.61 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the cropping seasons of 2012 and 2013, respectively. Fallow emissions mainly occurred after a soil freeze-thaw period and were 0.24 +/- 0.08, 0.23 +/- 0.09, 0.22 +/- 0.06, 0.32 +/- 0.21 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for U, 70% UI + P, U + P and UI + P, respectively. In the cropping season 2012, no effects of the UI + P and U + P treatments could be observed. In 2013, UI + P increased N2O emissions by 13% when compared to the U control, while a significant reduction of 24% was observed for the U + P treatment. The 70% UI + P treatment resulted in significantly lower (similar to 30%) N2O emissions and only slight reductions (7-10%) of grain yields in both years. Climate conditions varied strongly between seasons (416 and 704 mm total rainfall in 2012 and 2013, respectively) which most likely also influenced the performance of the inhibitors. Direct emission factors (EFd%) also increased strongly in 2013 (0.28 +/- 0.12 in 2012 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.41 in 2013 for U) but were generally lower than the 1% IPCC default value. Values for nitrogen recovery efficiency and yield-scaled N2O emissions were most preferable for the 70% UI + P treatment and indicate that reduced fertilizer rates in combination with inhibitors could represent a viable means for N2O mitigation without significant yield penalties in agricultural systems.

AB The substitution of synthetics by organic fertilizers, which is the current pillar of circular economy, has been broadly evaluated. However, varying results were obtained on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions as well as crop yields. Besides, in irrigated semi-arid croplands, drip fertigation has been suggested to be an effective practice for mitigating N2O and NO emissions while maintaining or enhancing agronomic performance. However, the promising combination of drip fertigation and organic fertilization remains poorly studied. By setting up melon (Cucumis melo L.) during 2022, and maize (Zea mays L.) during 2023, we aimed to evaluate the effect of different combinations of nitrogen (N) fertilizers: control without N fertilization, 100% of the N rate as solid manure (100OrM), 50% of the N rate as solid manure and 50% as urea (50OrM-50Syn), 50% of the N rate as solid manure and 50% as soluble organic (50OrM-50OrS), 100% of the N rate as urea (100Syn) and 100% of the N rate as soluble organic (100OrS). Urea and soluble organic fertilizers were supplied via drip fertigation. N-oxides (N2O and NO), methane (CH4) and ecosystem respiration (CO2) fluxes, mineral N (ammonium [NH4+] and nitrate [NO3-]), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and crop parameters were analysed. As regards N2O, no differences were observed between treatments in melon crop, whereas in maize crop, the cumulative emissions were the highest in 100OrM, followed by 50OrM-50Syn. Regarding NO cumulative emissions, in the melon crop were significantly lower in 50OrM-50Syn and 50OrM-50OrS between 34%-54%, compared with 100OrM and 100Syn. In the maize crop, the highest cumulative NO emission was also detected in solid manure treatment. The agronomic response of melon to N fertilization was only detected for total soluble solids (with maximum values in the 100Syn treatment). The combination of solid manure and top-dressing urea or soluble organic fertilizer prevented the penalties in N use efficiency, which were observed in 100Syn and 100OrS. Therefore, the combination of conventional solid manure at seeding and soluble organic fertilizer at dressing (applied by drip fertigation) was the most sustainable strategy from agronomic and environmental viewpoints in Mediterranean irrigated agroecosystems.

AB The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of organic soil amendment (compost) on bacterial populations associated with petroleum hydrocarbon (PH) degradation and nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics via pot experiments. Soil was artificially contaminated with diesel oil at total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration of 30,000 mg.kg-soil(-1) and compost was mixed with the contaminated soil at a 1:9 ratio (w/w). Maize seedlings were planted in each pot and a total of ten pots with two treatments (compost-amended and unamended) were prepared. The pot experiment was conducted for 85 days. The compost-amended soil had a significantly higher TPH removal efficiency (51.1%) than unamended soil (21.4%). Additionally, the relative abundance of the alkB gene, which is associated with PH degradation, was higher in the compost-amended soil than in the unamended soil. Similarly, cnorB and nosZ (which are associated with nitric oxide (NO) and N2O reduction, respectively) were also highly upregulated in the compost-amended soil. Moreover, the compost-amended soil exhibited higher richness and evenness indices, indicating that bacterial diversity was higher in the amended soil than in the unamended soil. Therefore, our findings may contribute to the development of strategies to enhance remediation efficiency and greenhouse gas mitigation during the rhizoremediation of diesel-contaminated soils.

AB We evaluated the effect of chemical fertilizer and manure applications on N2O emission from a managed grassland by establishing three treatment plots of chemical N fertilizer (chemical fertilizer), manure combined with chemical N fertilizer (manure) and no N fertilizer (control) at the Shizunai Experimental Livestock Farm in southern Hokkaido, Japan. The N2O fluxes from the soils were measured using a closed-chamber method from May 2005 to April 2008. Soil denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) in the root-mat layer (0-2.5 cm) and in the mineral soil layer (2.5-5 cm) of each treatment plot was measured using an acetylene inhibition method after treatment with NO3--N addition, glucose addition, both NO3--N and glucose addition or neither NO3--N nor glucose addition. Annual N2O emission ranged from 0.6 to 4.9 kg N2O-N ha-1year-1, with the highest emission observed in the manure plot and the lowest in the control plot. The chemical fertilizer induced emission factor (EF) (range: 0.85-1.32%) was significantly higher than the manure-induced EF (range: 0.35-0.85%). The denitrification potential of the soil horizons was measured with the addition of both NO3--N and glucose, and was significantly higher in root-mat soil than in mineral soil. Soil DEA in the root mat with the addition of NO3--N with and without the addition of glucose had a significantly positive correlation with soil pH (P < 0.05). Soil pH was significantly influenced by N source, which was significantly lower in the chemical fertilizer plot than in the control and manure plots. For a fixed quantity of available N, the application of manure could result in higher N2O emission compared with chemical fertilizer, owing to higher soil pH values under manure application than under chemical fertilizer application.

AB Although synthetic nitrogen fertilizers play an important role in increasing cereal grain yields, there have been increased concerns about their intensive utilization and environmental consequences. The overall goal of this study is to gain an insight into the integrated evaluation of greenhouse gas emission and nitric oxide (NO) release and grain yield as affected by nitrogen fertilization in a subtropical rice-wheat rotation system. The assessment was based on four consecutive yearly measurements of the fluxes of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ecosystem respiration (CO2), and the simultaneous observation of NO emissions in nonrice seasons under three fertilization practices (i.e., the conventional farmers' practice with common nitrogen application rate, an alternative practice with reduced nitrogen input, and no nitrogen application as a control). Clearly, these trace gas fluxes showed largely intra-annual and interannual variations, highlighting the importance of entire year measurement for multiple years to achieve representative annual estimates. The annual mean CH4 fluxes varied from 95 kg C ha(-1) (7.8 kg C t(-1) grain) for the farmers' practice to 205 kg C ha(-1) (25.7 kg C t(-1) grain) for the control, indicating that nitrogen fertilization inhibited CH4 emissions. Across all the years, the annual N2O emissions increased exponentially with an increasing nitrogen rate and harvested aboveground biomass. The annual N2O emission averaged 1.3-5.3 kg N ha(-1)(159-444 g N t(-1) grain) for all treatments. The annual direct emission factors of N2O-N tended to increase with increasing nitrogen rate and averaged 0.61% and 0.85% for the alternative and farmers' practices, respectively. Over all nonrice seasons, the seasonal mean NO emissions ranged from 0.15 to 1.4 kg N ha(-1)(58-253 g N t(-1) grain), and were equivalent to 0.43% to 0.54% of the applied nitrogen. Averaging across the 4 years, the annual aggregate emissions of CH4 and N2O were 7.4 t CO2-eq ha(-1)(928 kg CO2-eq t(-1)grain) for the control and 5.6-5.7 t CO2-eq ha(-1)(468-494 kg CO2-eq t(-1)grain) for the fertilized treatments. Despite the comparable greenhouse effect between the alternative and farmers' practices, reducing the common N rate by 37% resulted in decreased NO emission and increased nitrogen use efficiency, and negligible effects on economic return from grain yields.

AB Background and aims Greenhouse vegetable production is commonly associated with substantial nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, low nitrogen (N)and irrigation water use efficiency (NUE and IWUE) due to excess N input and frequent flooding irrigation, so it is crucial to develop irrigation and fertilization strategies to alleviate N2O emissions while ensuring vegetable productivity.
   Methods An experiment spanning three crop rotations of cucumber and celery in a greenhouse was conducted in North China Plain (NCP). It included four treatments, i.e., no N fertilizer (CK), farmers' conventional fertilization (FP), conventional fertilization rate with drip fertigation (FPD), and reduced N fertilizer rate with drip fertigation (RFPD).
   Results The mean annual area-scaled, yield-scaled N2O emissions and direct N2O emission factors (EFd) of FP were 36 kg N ha(-1), 175 g N t(-1) and 1.3%, respectively. FPD significantly reduced N2O emissions by over 25% (both in area- and yield-scaled), enhanced IWUE by 37%, and had no significant negative effects on vegetable yield or NUE. RFPD also significantly mitigated both area- and yield-scaled N2O emissions by about 45%, improved IWUE by 40% and NUE by 25%, while maintaining vegetable yield. Quadratic curves were fitted to the boundary points of ln-transformed N2O emissions against soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS), with the maximum N2O losses occurring at 19.5 celcius or 68%. N2O emissions responded to IWUE and NUEs following an exponential (R-2 = 0.71, P < 0.001) and a linear-plateau model (R-2 = 0.67, P < 0.001), respectively.
   Conclusions Drip irrigation with reduced N fertilizer rate is a suitable agronomic practice to simultaneously mitigate N2O emissions and improve both IWUE and NUE while maintaining vegetable yield from typical greenhouse cucumber-celery fields in NCP.

AB Managed grasslands are periodically renewed in north-western Europe, primarily in response to a decline in yield and nutritive value or sward damage. Grassland conversion to arable land is also a common agricultural practice on intensively used grassland sites. However, depending on the soil and its management, grassland break-up (i.e. the destruction of the grass sward and soil disturbance) is associated with the mineralisation of soil organic nitrogen (N) and the decomposition of stubbles and roots from the old grass sward, with both leading to enhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3-) leaching. Two sites were set up to investigate the effects of different grassland renewal techniques (keeping and improving the old sward, chemical sward killing and chemical killing of the sward followed by ploughing) with grassland conversion to maize cropping and permanent grassland as the reference treatments. The sites (Histic Gleysol and a Plaggic Anthrosol) differed in their organic matter content and groundwater level. N2O fluxes were measured weekly using static closed chambers for a period of two years. The relationship between N2O fluxes and explanatory/controlling variables was investigated using generalised additive models (GAM). The potential NO3- losses via NO3- leaching were quantified by taking weekly measurements of the soil mineral N (Mak) from the topsoil layer (0-30 cm) and from depth profiles (0-90 cm) in the autumn (pre-winter) and spring (post-winter). The aboveground biomass in the different treatments was also measured. Grassland renewal was not a significant source of direct N2O emissions at either experimental site during the two years of the study. There was only a short two-month period during which there were significantly increased N2O fluxes (up to a maximum of 1.6 kg N2O ha-1 day-1 in the Histic Gleysol) and treatment differences. N fertilisation (as reflected in the N content in soil), soil moisture, and microbial and plant respiratory activity were identified as important drivers of N2O emission. The destruction of the old grass sward (i.e. chemical killing by herbicide application and ploughing and conversion to maize cropping) resulted in an increased net N release of Nmin during the first year, which indicated losses via indirect N2O emission and a higher risk of NO3- leaching, especially on the sandy Plaggic Anthrosol. No yield effects were found after grassland renewal at either site. With respect to N2O mitigation and the prevention of NO3- leaching, it is recommended that the new grass sward should be rapidly established as a sink for Nmin and that the amount of available mineralised N following grassland renewal is taken into account when applying N fertiliser, as mineralisation following sward destruction provides high amounts of plant-available N.

AB The ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting (RFRH) system is an effective method for enhancing the rainfall water use efficiency and crop yield. Determining how the fertilization rate affects soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under the RFRH system has important practical significance for improving fertilization strategies and evaluating the environmental effects of the RFRH system. Therefore, we conducted a three-year field experiment in the Loess Plateau, China, to compare the RFRH system with traditional flat planting (T) at four different fertilizer rates (no fertilizer, N:P2O5 at 150:75 kg ha(-1), N:P2O5 at 300:150 kg ha(-1), and N:P2O5 at 450:225 kg ha(-1)). Under the same fertilization level, the soil water content (SWC) and dry matter were higher under RFRH compared with T, and the nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) content and N2O emissions were reduced. In the two planting models, SWC and NO3--N of each treatment and its corresponding N2O emission flux were significantly positively correlated. Under the same planting model, SWC decreased but NO3--N and the N2O emission increased with increasing fertilization rate. SWC was the key variable affecting the N2O emission flux in the RFRH system. In addition, the grain yield under RFRH increased by 2.2-28.0%, whereas the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) decreased by 1.0-16.1% and 13.0-56.8%, respectively, compared with T. The grain yield and GHGI had quadratic relationships with the fertilization rate. Moreover, GWP increased in a linear manner with the fertilizer rate. These findings suggest that the RFRH system is an effective tillage measure for reducing N2O emissions. When the N:P2O5 fertilization rate was 200:100 to 307:154 kg ha(-1), the RFRH system could maintain a higher grain yield and reduce the N2O emissions.

AB To evaluate the effects of urea placement on the concentration profiles of soil gases (NO and N2O) and mineral nitrogen, we conducted an experiment in a Chinese cabbage field in Tsukuba, Japan, over one cultivation season. Soil gas and mineral nitrogen concentrations at different depths (0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.45 and 0.6 m) were measured 1-2 times per week in experimental plots fertilized by either urea incorporation (U-I; uniformly spread over the soil surface and incorporated down to approximately 0.15-0.2 m) or by urea deep band (U-DB; placed in 0.12-m-deep trenches cut at intervals of 0.6 m). Considerable NO was observed in the top 0.2 m of soil in the U-I treatment during the first 2 weeks after fertilization (WAF), whereas in soil in the U-DB treatment NO was observed only at depths of 0.1 and 0.15 m for approximately 6 WAF. In U-I, the maximum soil N2O concentration was observed 5 days after fertilization (DAF). Significantly high N2O concentration in soil of U-DB was observed 2 WAF, and lasted longer than that in UI (4 vs 2 weeks). The NH4+ concentrations in U-I exceeded background levels during the first 2 WAF, with a maximum 5 DAF. The high NH4+ concentrations in soil in the U-DB treatment, mainly located within the 0.05-0.15-m soil zone, lasted approximately 6 weeks, with a maximum at 9 DAF. The NO3- concentrations in both U-I and U-DB increased shortly after the application of urea; the increases were higher in U-I than in U-DB. These time-depth series of concentration profiles clearly demonstrate the effect of urea placement on NO and N2O production and transportation in soil and provide a better understanding of the emission dynamics of these gases than previous reports. In addition, comparison of NO and N2O emissions among field, laboratory and numerical experiments firmly suggests that deep urea placement is highly effective in reducing NO emissions, with less effect on N2O emissions from Andisols.

AB Although nitrogen fertilizer is crucially important for China's crop production, the overuses in the intensive cereal cropping systems of the North China Plain has caused extensive concern for its environmental consequences on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes. To characterize the integration of environmental and agronomic aspects of fertilizer management, we conducted two annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summer maize (Zea mays L.) rotation cycles under five fertilization treatments, including the farmers' conventional practice (CP) amended with synthetic nitrogen, three alternative managements of reduced nitrogen inputs with synthetic fertilizers alone (UA), synthetic fertilizers combined with poultry manure (UA + PM) or controlled-release urea combined with poultry manure (CU + PM), and the control without nitrogen fertilization (CK). The N2O and NO fluxes and direct emission factors varied seasonally and annually. These variations could be interpreted mechanically by a revised "hole-in-the-pipe" model and dual Michaelis-Menten and Arrhenius kinetics. The CM, CP, UA, UA + PM, and CU + PM treatments released N2O at 0.65, 4.64, 3.66, 2.88, and 2.40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, and NO at least 0.42, 2.35, 2.24, 1.30, and 1.18 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The annual direct emission factors of N2O and NO were 0.41-0.67% and 0.18-0.32%, respectively. The three alternative managements decreased both N2O and NO emissions, expressed either on an area basis or relative to grain yield, without sacrificing crop yields compared to CP. However, their mitigation effects on each gas emission were different. The UA treatment reduced only N2O emission, while UA + PM and CU + PM showed significant mitigation effects on both gases as compared to CP or UA. Overall, our results provide insight into environmental aspect of fertilizer management in major cereal crops and suggest that reducing nitrogen input coupled with organic manure incorporation could be beneficial for simultaneously mitigating nitrogen-containing trace gas fluxes and sustaining cereal grain yields.

AB In French Guiana, the population growth will result in an increase in demand for agricultural products and thus, will lead to an increase in the amount of tropical forests converted into cropland or pasture. Impacts of different agricultural systems on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes have not been studied in French Guiana. In this context, the fire-free chop-and-mulch method was used to convert a tropical forest site to agriculture. This study focused on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and we compared four land uses: (1) the undisturbed tropical forest, (2) recently converted grassland and recently converted croplands (fertilized soybean/maize rotation) with either (3) disk tillage or (4) no tillage.
   N2O measurements were obtained through the chamber technique and conducted over a 1-year period (measurements began 19 months after the forest was cleared). N2O fluxes were related to soil parameters measured at each sampling date: nitrate and ammonium contents, gravimetric water content (GWC) and temperature.
   Through the entire period, the mean (+/- standard error) and median N2O fluxes were 3.8 +/- 0.5 and 2.7 g N ha(-1) day(-1), respectively for undisturbed tropical forest and 2.4 +/- 0.9 and 0.8 g N ha(-1) day(-1), respectively for grassland (mowed Brachiaria ruziziensis). For croplands, no significant difference was found for N2O emissions between both agricultural practices. The mean ( standard error) and median N2O fluxes were 8.5 +/- 1.2 and 4.0 g N ha(-1) day(-1), respectively for disk tillage plots and 8.5 +/- 1.3 and 3.6 g N ha(-1) day(-1), respectively for no tillage plots. Nitrogen inputs (due to the application of fertilizer or due to the mineralization of crop residues) led to higher N2O fluxes, resulting in significantly higher mean N2O emissions from croplands compared to the forest, when only considering land use effect on N2O fluxes in a statistical model. The soil nitrate content, GWC and temperature had a significant positive effect on N2O fluxes. Taking into account these soil parameters in another statistical model, N2O emissions from croplands were not higher than the natural N2O emissions from tropical forest soils. Our results suggest that, if more forest will have to be converted in the course of the expected population growth in French Guiana, it could have low impact on the soil N2O fluxes (similar to natural fluxes from forest) with the improving of farming techniques (for example modification of the splitting of N-fertilizer) in the cropping plots.

AB Over the last century, anthropogenic greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions have changed the global climate, and agriculture plays an important role in the global flux of GHG. Agricultural management practices, such as split N applications and the use of controlled-release fertilisers have significantly increased the crop yield and N-use efficiency by balancing the N demand of crops and the N availability of soils. However, the impacts of these practices on GHG emissions (in particular in wheat-peanut relay intercropping systems) have not been evaluated in detail. In this study, a common compound fertiliser and a controlled release compound fertiliser (CRF) were used the day prior to sowing, at the jointing stage of wheat and at the peanut anthesis stage in ratios of 50-50-0% (JCF100), 35-35-30% (JCF70) and 35-35-30% (JCRF70), with a control treatment of 0 kg ha(-1). The findings demonstrated that treatment JCF70 achieved increases in yields of 9.7% and 14.6% for wheat grain and peanut pod, respectively, compared to treatment JCF100; however, this treatment also significantly increased soil emissions of CO2 and N2O. In addition, cumulative emissions of CO2 and N2O were higher in the peanut growing season by 74.4 and 31.7%, respectively, than in the wheat growing season owing to the relatively higher soil temperature during the former season. Fertilisation combined with irrigation, was found to be the main cause of GHG emissions. Under the same fertiliser rate and N-management style, JCRF70 further increased the yield of peanut pods and the total combined yield of peanut and wheat by 10.3% and 8.9%, respectively, compared to treatment JCF70. The cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions in treatment JCRF70 were 20.4-45.4% less than those in treatment JCF70. The total global warming potentials of CO2 and N2O were lowest in treatment JCRF70 owing to it providing the highest grain yield. Therefore, N application with three splits, together with the use of a slow-release fertiliser, may be a simple and effective approach to enhance the grain yield whilst reducing the GHG emissions.

AB Croplands mainly act as net sources of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as nitrogen oxide (NO), a precursor of troposheric ozone. We determined the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) balance of a four-year crop rotation, including maize, wheat, barley and mustard, to provide a base for exploring mitigation options of net emissions. The crop rotation had a positive net ecosystem production (NEP) of 4.4 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) but represented a net source of carbon with a net biome production (NBP) of -1.3 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). The nitrogen balance of the rotation was correlated with the carbon balance and resulted in net loss (-24 +/- 28 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). The main nitrogen losses were nitrate leaching (-11.7 +/- 1.0 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and ammonia volatilization (-9 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Dry and wet depositions were 6.7 +/- 3.0 and 5.9 +/- 0.1 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Fluxes of nitrous (N2O) and nitric (NO) oxides did not contribute significantly to the N budget (N2O: -1.8 +/- 0.04; NO: -0.7 +/- 0.04 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) but N2O fluxes equaled 16% of the total greenhouse gas balance. The link between the carbon and nitrogen balances are discussed. Longer term experiments would be necessary to capture the trends in the carbon and nitrogen budgets within the variability of agricultural ecosystems.

AB Enhanced-efficiency nitrogen fertilizer (EENF) has gained considerable attention for improving nitrogen use efficiency and mitigating N2O emission in many agro-ecosystems. However, the effectiveness of EENF is highly variable under field condition. The factors influencing the efficacy of EENF are not well understood. Here, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the key factors affecting the efficacy of EENF in upland cropping systems. The effects of EENF were found to be similar among maize, wheat, and barley, while they varied among different EENF products. Inhibitors (IS), including nitrification inhibitors (NI), urease inhibitors (UI), and the combination of UI and NI, significantly mitigated N2O emission and increased crop yield, resulting in a greater reduction in yield-scaled N2O emission compared with slow- or control-releasing fertilizer (S/CRF). Reductions in yield-scaled N2O emission response to IS and S/CRF were both greater in arid regions than in humid regions. Soil pH and texture had less impact on the effect of IS than S/CRF. The efficacy of IS and S/CRF were not significant when N use rates were between 120 and 180 kg N ha(-1). Surface broadcasting were unfavorable for mitigating N2O emissions with both IS and S/CRF. The impact of tillage on the efficacy of IS and S/CRF was affected by climate. The effectiveness of S/CRF depended more on these factors than did IS. This meta-analysis highlighted the necessity to connect EENF products with specific climatic, soil, and agronomic attributes for predicting their effectiveness. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB It is still a severe challenge to optimize the field management practices for a multi-crop system when simultaneously aiming at yield sustainability and minimum negative impacts on climate as well as atmosphere and water quality. This site-scale case study was devoted to developing a biogeochemical process model-based approach as a solution to this challenge. The best management practices (BMPs) of a three-crop system growing cotton and winter wheat-summer maize (W-M) in rotation, which is widely adopted in northern China, were identified. The BMPs referred to the management alternatives with the lowest negative impact potentials (NIPs) among the scenarios satisfying all given constraints. The independent variables used to determine the NIPs and those utilized as constrained criteria were simulated by the DeNitrification-DeComposition model, which was modified in this study. Due to the unsatisfactory performance of the model in daily simulations of nitric oxide (NO) emission and net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE), the model was modified to (i) newly parameterize the soil moisture effects on NO production during nitrification, and (ii) replace the original NEE calculation approach with an algorithm based on gross primary production. Validation of the modified model showed statistically meaningful agreements between the simulations and observations in the cotton and W-M fields. Three BMP alternatives with overlapping uncertainties of simulated NIPs were screened from 6000 management scenarios randomly generated by Latin hypercube sampling. All of these BMP alternatives adopted the baseline (currently applied) practices of crop rotation (3 consecutive years of cotton rotating with 3 years of W-M in each 6-year cycle), the fraction of crop residue incorporation (100 %), and deep tillage (30 cm) for cotton. At the same time, these BMP alternatives would use 18% less fertilizer nitrogen and sprinkle or flood-irrigate similar to 23% less water than the baseline while adopting reduced tillage (5 cm) for W-M. Compared with the baseline practices, these BMP alternatives could simultaneously sustain crop yields, annually enlarge the soil organic carbon stock by 4 parts per thousand or more, mitigate the aggregate emission of greenhouse gases, NO release, ammonia volatilization, and nitrate leaching by similar to 7 %, similar to 25 %, similar to 2 %, and similar to 43 %, respectively, despite a similar to 5% increase in N2O emission. However, further study is still necessary for field confirmation of these BMP alternatives. Nevertheless, this case study proposed a practical approach to optimize multi-crop system management to simultaneously achieve multiple United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

AB A multi-season N-15 tracer recovery experiment was conducted on an Oxisol cropped with wheat, maize and sorghum to compare crop N recoveries of different fertilisation strategies and determine the main pathways of N losses that limit N recovery in these agroecosystems. In the wheat and maize seasons, N-15-labelled fertiliser was applied as conventional urea (CONV) and urea coated with a nitrification inhibitor (DMPP). In sorghum, the fate of N-15-labelled urea was monitored in this crop following a legume ley pasture (L70) or a grass ley pasture (G100). The fertiliser N applied to sorghum in the legume-cereal rotation was reduced (70 kg N ha(-1)) compared to the grass-cereal (100 kg N ha(-1)) to assess the availability of the N residual from the legume ley pasture. Average crop N recoveries were 73 % (CONV) and 77 % (DMPP) in wheat and 50 % (CONV) and 51 % (DMPP) in maize, while in sorghum were 71 % (L70) and 53 % (G100). Data gathered in this study indicate that the intrinsic physical and chemical conditions of Oxisols can be extremely effective in limiting N losses via deep leaching or denitrification. Elevated crop N-15 recoveries can be therefore obtained in subtropical Oxisols using conventional urea while in these agroecosystems DMPP urea has no significant scope to increase fertiliser N recovery in the crop. Overall, introducing a legume phase to limit the fertiliser N requirements of the following cereal crop proved to be the most effective strategy to reduce N losses and increase fertiliser N recovery.
